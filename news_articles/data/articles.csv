secret that with the rise of smartphone dominance, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) is at risk to be disrupted in its search business.\n\nUnderstanding that, the company has been working on several major projects that could diversify its revenue streams and reduce its exposure to advertising risk. In this article I want to focus on its Cloud business, in which it now enjoys a 16.5 percent market share, with the potential to boost share in the years ahead.\n\nEven though the global Cloud market is a hefty $154 billion this year, by 2026 it\'s expected to climb to almost $500 billion. If Google were only able to maintain its market share it would be a major revenue growth engine. As the Cloud market moves beyond storage to the need for more advanced tools, Google is positioned to grow share in the years ahead; the only question is which companies will it take share away from.\n\nSource: Wikibon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the market leader with 37.1 Cloud share, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) not too far behind with 28.4 share. That leaves about 18 percent share outside of its major competitors to win, and of course the potential to take some away from there as well.\n\nSource: mrtopstep\n\nRecent cloud performance and outlook\n\nGoogle groups together its performance of hardware, Play and Cloud as Other, so it\'s difficult to extract an exact number for Cloud growth. But it appears of the three in Other, Cloud is leading the way in revenue growth, with the combined total of 62 percent year-over-year to $3.4 billion for the quarter.\n\nFor full year, the Other segment grew by 41 percent, pointing to the latest quarter indicating an acceleration in those areas. Comments by the company concerning the growth spurt of Cloud services suggest it\'s the major driver of the Other segment.\n\nOf particular note is when the company talked about customers telling it has moved beyond ""table stakes."" That means Google sees the Cloud business as expanding from a room full of servers to providing more advanced features, features catering to Google\'s strengths.\n\nThere were four areas the company pointed out in its latest earnings report: ""data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy, tools for application development, and the ability to create connected business platforms."" The latter it mentioned as leveraging its ""recent acquisition of Apigee.""\n\nWhere Google shines\n\nWhile all four of the areas above are important in regard to Cloud services, where Google really stands out is in data analytics and machine learning; it\'s probably where the company may be able to differentiate and stand out as the Cloud gets more demanding concerning business services.\n\nIn the areas of data analytics and machine learning, I see Google as having advanced beyond the pace of its two largest competitors, and in that regard has the potential to grow significantly in its Cloud business.\n\nIt is positioned nicely for the emergence of the Internet of Things, which represents the connection of an estimated 25 billion devices in the near future. A lot of the connection will be related to services offered by businesses.\n\nIts expertise is allowing it not only to grow existing share by encouraging customers to grow their use of Google\'s Cloud business, but also allowing it to ""accelerate growth with new Fortune 2000 customers.""\n\nGoogle says that over 3 million businesses are now paying for its G Suite, a reference to its ""cloud-based collaboration and productivity applications.""\n\nWith momentum being a key in this market segment, Google asserts the acceleration of the number of the increase in pace of product rollouts has been well received by customers and partners it\'s working with. New companies it started partnerships with in the last quarter were Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Improbable, Slack (Private:SLACK), Pivotal and Red Hat (NYSE:RHT).\n\nConclusion\n\nGoogle is going after several different markets in its strategy to reduce advertising risk going forward. The other major initiatives are YouTube\'s new streaming service and self-driving cars. Further out self-driving cars have a lot of potential, while the low-margin streaming business isn\'t impressive to me. It may generate revenue, but it will probably take a bite out of earnings for at least a couple of years, if not longer.\n\nFor that reason, I see Google Cloud Platform or GCP as the most important growth initiative for Google outside of its advertising segment, for at least a couple of years, with self-driving car technology picking up the slack further out. The self-driving business is less of a sure thing, while Google\'s Cloud business is prepping for a major upward growth spurt.\n\nWith Other generating $3.4 billion in the last quarter, and Google saying its Cloud business growth has been taking off, it looks like over half of that can be safely assumed being part of the Cloud unit of the company. I think it wouldn\'t be a stretch to conclude in a couple of years it should be generating about $20 billion a year for the tech giant.\n\nThe good news is even if Google isn\'t able to dislodge the two market leaders, I think it\'s at least going to shrink the gap between them. Expected growth in Cloud services ensures the company will increase revenue and earnings from GCP in the years ahead, as evidenced by the huge growth its ""Other"" segment has been experiencing over the last quarter and year. The growth momentum the company has in its Cloud services is going to accelerate.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.', 'I recently wrote an article suggesting that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) was the perfect value play, as it was a growth stock that was not unreasonably valued based on various criteria. Now I’ll dive into what I think the risks of GOOGL stock are, and how they may manifest.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMy biggest concern with GOOGL stock has always been that it is effectively a one-trick pony. Alphabet is the largest digital advertising billboard in the world, with about 88% of its revenues coming from advertising. Moreover, GOOGL stock’s growth has been driven by this spectacular seizure of internet territory from competitors.\n\nIn fact, during the financial crisis, ad revenues still grew about 8% year-over-year in 2009 despite a worldwide ad revenue decline of 11% that year.\n\nGOOGL Stock and Digital Advertising\n\nNow, digital advertising was still in its hyper-growth phase back then. Should another major crisis hit, I’m not so sure that Alphabet won’t see a decline. Yet what’s so astonishing about GOOGL stock is just how much money it makes from advertising. It could get hit with a 20% decline in total revenues, which would bring it roughly in line with fiscal year 2015 results, and still generate net income of $15 billion or so, and operating cash flow of $26 billion or so.\n\nThis is hardly a catastrophe, which shows that for now at least, GOOGL has a lock on substantial growth in ad revenue. However, that advertising is the result of people using Google’s search engine. What if that changes? Right now, Google has more than 80% search engine market share. It’s so popular that we now use the product’s name as a verb.\n\nI think it will be very difficult to supplant Google as far as search engine usage goes. However, there is other behavior which may result in less reliance on the search engine and, therefore, fewer eyeballs for ads. Mobile apps have obviously exploded in number and usage. The more adept and fully functional that apps become, the less Google may be used.\n\nSocial media is only going to grow, and the more that these products offer in terms of either their own search engines, or places for advertisers to divide their ad spend, the worse it is for GOOGL.\n\nNext Page', 'Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has announced that it will roll out its new YouTube TV streaming television service over the next few months. In December 2016, Alphabet separated its Waymo self-driving car business from the Google X incubator lab; Waymo LLC now functions as an independent subsidiary. Waymo recently sued Uber, alleging the theft of proprietary technology. Argus sees Alphabet as one of the tech industry’s leaders, along with Facebook, Apple and Amazon. These companies have come to dominate new developments in mobile, public cloud, and big data analytics, as well as emerging areas such as artificial intelligence, the internet of things and virtual/augmented reality. Argus maintained its 2017 EPS estimate of $41.17 and its 2018 forecast of $47.79. Argus believes that GOOGL shares are attractively valued given the company’s rapidly expanding businesses.\n\nArgus maintained its BUY rating on Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) with a target price of $950. The bear case on Alphabet has been that as users move to mobile, they will abandon search for other mobile apps. Bears have also argued that Alphabet will be less successful in monetizing mobile search advertising than it has been with desktop search. However, mobile search advertising appears to be growing strongly, even as it generates lower margins than desktop. Meanwhile, the company’s next-generation businesses, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Google Play, have all begun to generate significant revenue growth.\n\nWhile the 2015 transition to the Alphabet holding company structure has been a source of confusion for some, investors should not be fooled into thinking that the company has changed in any fundamental way: it continues to be driven by digital advertising revenue, with search advertising at its core, and by its extraordinary positioning as the search engine leader in both desktop and mobile. The company’s robust and consistent advertising revenue growth is evidence that it continues to successfully navigate this paradigm shift — from desktop to mobile. Argus thinks that the Alphabet reorganization should help to develop the company’s next generation of leaders, as well as new ideas, products, and businesses.\n\nThe firm sees Alphabet as one of the tech industry’s leaders, along with Facebook, Apple and Amazon.

Argus believes that GOOGL shares are attractively valued given the company’s rapidly expanding businesses.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this article are subjects of research reports issued recently by investment firms. Their opinions in no way represent those of SmartStockNews.com', 'When it comes to the cloud, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) — the dominant name in the category — is not alone anymore. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) this week announced its cloud presence with authority, boasting a list of prominent client wins, including Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) and eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY ).\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAt the company’s Google Cloud Next conference keynote, Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt declared, “We’re here for real.” He added, “[Google] has the money, the means and the commitment to pull off a new platform of computation globally, for everybody who needs it.”\n\nThe Mountain View-based company calls Google Cloud, which is third behind No. 2 cloud player, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), its next growth engine. Google CEO Sundar Pichai deemed the platform as an “extraordinarily big bet.”\n\nTo that end, Alphabet, which on Thursday unveiled an enterprise version of its Google Hangouts messaging platform called “Hangouts Chat,” must find ways to convince current and would-be enterprise clients that Google Cloud is the platform they belong on.\n\nGOOGL Stock\n\nDespite the strong revenue Alphabet generates, Google’s cloud revenue, which is estimated to have a run rate of only $1 billion, according to Recode. The company ended fiscal 2016 with revenue of $90.27 billion.\n\nBy contrast, market leader Amazon’s Web Services last year surpassed an annual run rate of $12 billion. Notably, Google Cloud’s $1 billion run rate is still about one-third of Microsoft’s $2.7 billion. But all of this means that Google still has tons of room for growth. Over the past year, the company has landed cloud clients such as Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS ), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD ) and even rival Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ).\n\nWhy are these industry titans important to Google?\n\nAccording to IDC, worldwide spending on public cloud services is expected to soar to more than $195 billion by 2020, more than doubling the revenue of 2016. “Cloud software will significantly outpace traditional software product delivery over the next five years, growing nearly three times faster than the software market as a whole and becoming the significant growth driver to all functional software markets,” said Benjamin McGrath, senior research analyst, SaaS and Business Models.\n\nMeanwhile, Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin forecasts public cloud spending, currently around $58 billion annually, will triple to $205 billion in the next three years. As Google’s cloud business grows, GOOGL stock will too.\n\nBottom Line for Alphabet\n\nGOOGL stock closed Thursday at $857.84, up 0.49%. The shares have risen 8.7% year to date, while climbing 17.6% over the past year. These aren’t breathtaking returns when compared to the almost 50% one-year gains Amazon stock has delivered, but Alphabet looks poised to make up ground if the company can realize its cloud ambitions.\n\nAs of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.', ""Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)‘s stock had its “overweight” rating reissued by equities researchers at Morgan Stanley in a report released on Saturday.

Here is a chart of both metrics:The bars represent revenue (TTM) and the orange line traces net income (TTM), which in English is after tax profit. But, just as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has faced concerns over a diversification of its revenue stream with respect to the iPhone, and as Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) has faced concerns of slowing revenue and earnings growth due to a lack of diversification, so too has Alphabet Inc faced those concerns.That mountain of revenue is about 80% from advertising. Most of that advertising comes from Google\'s Search, and there has been a concern that as search has moved to mobile, Google has less control over the ecosystem which could give way to Apple Inc\'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone, if the company so chose, to move away from Google, and it also means Google now faces advertising competition from Facebook\'s enormous user base, and even, oddly, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).But, Google has a secret weapon -- in fact, it has, and each has the potential to make up a large cap tech company in and of themselves. We can start with the simple, and move to the breaking news at the end.First, there is this absurd narrative circling that smartphones are doomed to be the next PCs - a dying technology replaced with newer looks, designs and specs. Here is the PC market via our friends at Statista:The PC market is in decline and will continue to be. But, friends, that is not at all emblematic of the smartphone market. Check out this chart from Statista.I don\'t know what else to say other than, the smartphone market is growing, not shrinking.We wrote a dedicated dossier to Google\'s new Pixel smartphone Google Has a Huge New Upside Weapon . In that dossier we note the obvious, but somehow wildly misunderstood reality that Wall Street is missing:We must understand that simply launching a smartphone does not mean it will work. Just ask Microsoft. But, as we discuss in that dossier above, Google has done more than just ""launch a phone.""Let\'s call it an even split at the high end for smartphones, meaning between Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung, about 450 million high end phones have been sold in the last year by the two dominant players.Alphabet Inc\'s Google Pixel has been given the imprimatur of the tech critic crowd, placing it directly in competition with the Android Samsung flagships and the Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones. In English, the Google Pixel is a legitimate substitution threat.We\'ll stop here so not wax rhapsodic (and not to repeat ourselves), but the smartphone market has made Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) the largest company in the world, even a little piece of that market for Alphabet Inc could mean fully a 25% rise in revenue from this opportunity alone. The Pixel 2 was just announced and will be here in 2017.After all of that, you could make an argument thatWe wrote a dossier It\'s Time to Focus on Google\'s Cars . In that piece we uncover the magnificence that is Waymo.In the last couple of months Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has spun out its self-driving car segment into a stand-alone company, still under the Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) umbrella, called Waymo. Before we dig into the details, a quick step back. This is the expected growth in the market for self-driving featured cars:For the longest time this project felt like one of the many moonshots that would never really see the light of day - that\'s what Wall Street would have had us think, at least. But it isn\'t a moonshot, it\'s a business - and a rather large one.It was lost in the wind of headlines, but Alphabet inc has already started talks with General Motors and Ford as well as Honda and Chrysler-Fiat. As we note from that dossier:In our recent dossier Google is Gunning for the Cloud , we discuss at length the moves Alphabet Inc is putting on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft to snap that market into its own hands.While the cloud has become more like a colloquialism than a name for a technology, the tailwinds to this technological shift are simply unstoppable at this point. There is too much data and too many connected devices even today, not to speak of the absurdity that is to come, to not have a machine learning driven technology to balance the needs of every website, every app, all the data in complete harmony. Enter the cloud.The worldwide public cloud market is forecast to rise from $154 billion this year to nearly half a trillion dollars by 2026. Right now, there are two distinct leaders. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the undisputed leader and right behind the e-commerce giant is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Here is a market share chart:While the mainstream media will talk about the battle between Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation, the third place company is none other than Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).We won\'t belabor the point here since it is written nice and neat in the dossier noted above, but the point is that the cloud computing market is going to be enormous, and Google has an advantage over both of the incumbents -- there simply is no company that has made more progress in the world of end-to-end machine learning and artificial intelligence than Google.The demands of the cloud will very soon go well past ""having a bunch of servers in a room,"" and well into the realm of advanced analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. With over 25 billion devices soon to be connected in the Internet of Things, don\'t be surprised to see Google as the new leader in the cloud -- with an advantage that goes well beyond a well formed API structure and cost savings.Now, that was three of the four secret weapons for Google -- but friends, number four may be larger than all of them.It\'s just a matter of fact that cord-cutting is coming. In fact, here is a nice visual we put together with data from Statista:Everything from cord-cutters, to people never having cable, to the number of cable subscribers is pointing in the obvious direction of a need for a new way to deliver TV. And Google is the company with an undisputed lead that it may never relinquish.YouTube has more viewers aged 18-49, now listen carefully,than any other network or cable broadcast channel in the United States. Here\'s what new data just showed:That reality led to one of the biggest stories in technology of the last five years that somehow has received very little notice. On February 28th we learned that Google has partnered to create ""YouTubeTV."" And what is this new ""YouTube TV?"" It\'s astreaming TV service that will up end cable.Then CNBC added some more flavor:The most recent data puts cable TV subscriptions at just under 50 million, and subscribers to cable broadband now at 55 million. If we use 50 million as our base, that puts the total addressable market (TAM) for Google at 50 million * $40 /month = $2 billion a month, or $24 billion a year,Let\'s keep our eyes on the ball, here. Alphabet Inc is still an advertising first company, and there is risk to that business as mobile becomes a bigger part, if not the central part, and the ad blocking phenomenon also grows.Further, all of these opportunities, taken as one business at a time, are yet to be proven as winners for Alphabet Inc, although the cloud and YouTube are doing quite well already.If this is the kind of research you seek, beyond all the click bait that clutters the world of ""news,"" then what we offer may be up your alley: Our research sits side-by-side with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, JP Morgan, and the rest on professional terminals as a part of the famed Thomson First Call group.

The company says this employee is Anthony Levandowski.\n\nAnthony Levandowski is the founder of Otto. Otto is a self-driving car startup that was created in 2016. Uber bought this startup in 2016 and added Levandowski to its team. Levandowski was a previous employee of the GOOGL car company before founding Otto.\n\nAccording to Waymo, Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential and proprietary design files for its hardware systems six weeks before resigning from the GOOGL company. Among those files were the company’s design data for its LiDAR system.\n\nWaymo says that it has decided to file a lawsuit against Uber after receiving an email from one of its suppliers. The supplier makes parts for the GOOGL company’s LiDAR system. In the email was a picture of a circuit board for Uber’s own LiDAR technology. Waymo says this circuit board looked incredibly like the one it created for its own LiDAR system.\n\nWaymo says that after conducting some research, it has discovered that other former employees also downloaded confidential information from the company. These employees now work for Uber and Otto. The GOOGL company claims this was an organized act to steal its trade secrets and intellectual property.\n\nWaymo also claims that Anthony Levandowski expressed his desire to “replicate” the company’s technology as a rival. It claims he told employees of this plan months before his retirement.', 'Alphabet claims that one of its former employees downloaded more than 14,000 secret files before handing in his resignation\n\nThe Google owner has filed a suit against Uber and its Otto self-driving technology division\n\nSan Francisco looks set to be the battleground for a possible Clash of the Titans after Google owner Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) filed a lawsuit against .\n\nThe court case relates to the two companies’ self-driving technology units; Waymo ( ) and Otto ( ).\n\nAccording to a lawsuit filed in a San Francisco court on Thursday, Alphabet is alleging that the taxi-hailing giant has stolen patents and trade secrets, claiming that Uber’s designs for a driverless car share a “striking resemblance” with its own.\n\nWeirdly, the allegations stem from an email sent from one of Uber’s component suppliers who “apparently inadvertently” copied in members of the Waymo team on an email.\n\nThe email reportedly contained various images and drawings of Uber’s Otto technology and its 3D sensors which contained Alphabet trade secrets, according to Alphabet.\n\nThe company is also claiming that one of Waymo’s former engineers, Anthony Levandowski, “downloaded more than 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary files shortly before his resignation”.\n\nThe lawsuit adds that Levandowski took “extraordinary efforts to raid Waymo’s design server and then conceal his activities”.\n\nThe story is made even more interesting by the fact that the engineer left Alphabet to launch his own self-driving truck company called Otto, which was later acquired by Uber.\n\nIn a statement, Alphabet said: “Misappropriating this technology is akin to stealing a secret recipe from a beverage company.”', ""Google parent Alphabet Inc. is suing Uber for allegedly stealing trade secrets from Alphabet's self-driving company, Waymo, to jump-start its own autonomous vehicle program.

When you think of the cloud, the one company that tends to immediately come to mind is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) — if for no other reason than when its AWS cloud servers go down, half the internet seems to go with them. But Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is betting big on the cloud too, and at its Next 2017 event, the company had some big announcements.\n\nSource: Google\n\nGoogle cloud is celebrating some much-needed wins, including new partners, a significant steal for G Suite and recognition for topping cloud providers in 2016 for reliability.\n\nGoogle Cloud Takes Aim at AWS, Azure\n\nThe public cloud is currently dominated by Amazon’s AWS, with over 30% of the market — triple the footprint of second-place Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Azure. Google cloud is in fourth place, trailing International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ).\n\nThe cloud is a huge market already and it’s expected to get far larger, quickly. Forrester recently pegged the expected value of the public cloud — services like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud — to reach $236 billion by 2020.\n\nAnd Google wants a bigger piece of that pie.\n\nAt its Next 2017 conference keynote, the company made the case for choosing Google cloud over AWS or Azure. While noting that it has invested $30 billion in its cloud services, the company rattled off an impressive list of companies that have recently made the move to Google cloud. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY ) and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: CL ) represent the large corporate side of Google cloud’s capabilities, while popular apps like Pokemon Go and Snap Inc.’s (NYSE: SNAP ) Snapchat show off its suitability for hosting consumer apps.\n\nGoogle cloud’s head Diane Greene, took the opportunity to fire a shot at Amazon’s AWS and the bad PR it’s received for large-scale outages. Chances are, you were affected by an AWS issue at the end of February that slowed or took down thousands of websites, apps and services for hours.\n\nGreene noted that Google cloud has been recognized for topping all cloud service providers in availability for 2016. She puts that availability level at 99.999% reliability, which is very impressive.\n\nIt certainly makes a case for switching from AWS.\n\nNext Page', 'Pacific Crest continues to recommend buying Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Attendance at day one of Google Cloud Next \'17 significantly exceeded the firm’s expectations, suggesting much greater interest in the platform. Google focused on its increased sales and support capabilities, a growing partner ecosystem, and data analytics and machine learning as competitive differentiators. These, along with the tremendous interest level, increase the firm’s confidence that Google can continue growing its cloud business and build it into a meaningful revenue and profit contributor over time.\n\nDespite a larger venue than last year, crowds at Cloud Next 2017 were crushing on day one, with massive lines to get into the event and very long overflow lines to get into popular breakout sessions, particularly those around machine learning. Although it is difficult to separate growth in overall interest in cloud computing from interest in GCP specifically, the large crowds suggests a significant increase in interest around GCP in the past 12 months.\n\nA key message of the keynote was Google\'s expanded sales/support capabilities and desire to work with channel partners to help serve enterprise customers. This seems to be generating solid early results, as Google had success stories with several large enterprises across a variety of workloads, including: Home Depot, Colgate Palmolive, Disney and eBay. Per Pacific Crest’s proprietary discussions with GCP partners and industry contacts, Google’s strategic choice to pursue a more hybrid cloud message versus AWS is attracting more channel support.\n\nGoogle continued to focus on its expertise in machine learning and data analytics as competitive advantages versus other cloud platforms. While the message was not new, the response was much more positive than the firm expected. Machine-learning–based tools seemed to get the most positive responses in the keynote and machine learning sessions were significantly over-subscribed; the initial machine learning breakout appeared to have more than 100 people in an overflow line, hoping to get in if registered attendees did not show. If artificial intelligence and machine learning prove to have as applications as broad as Pacific Crest believes they could, Google\'s branding and capabilities around this could allow it to leapfrog competitors for important workloads.\n\nWhile the firm’s core investment thesis remains most closely tied to the profit potential of the core search and YouTube businesses, the presentations today increased its confidence that GCP could develop into a meaningful revenue and profit driver in the coming years. If this happens, it would likely represent upside to the firm’s current estimates, which could drive GOOGL beyond its $1,040 price target.\n\nPacific Crest’s price target of $1,040 is based on 16x EV/EBITDA, using its 2017 Google EBITDA estimate of $38.9 billion, which implicitly assigns zero net value for ""Other Bets."" Market and macroeconomic conditions could interfere with the realization of this price target, as could risks such as entering new markets, the global macroeconomy, increasing competition outside of search, industry changes brought about by the shift to mobile and the difficulty of managing high growth based on its non-core investments.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this article are subjects of research reports issued recently by investment firms. Their opinions in no way represent those of SmartStockNews.com', 'Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has always been a major force in the data science and machine learning world, and its latest acquisition will only solidify its strong positioning even further.\n\nThe company will reportedly acquire Kaggle, a data science and machine learning competition specialist. Kaggle absolutely dominates its specific niche of providing a platform for companies and individuals to compete against each other for real money.\n\nTechCrunch has details on the move, which hasn’t yet been made official:\n\nSources tell us that Google is acquiring Kaggle, a platform that hosts data science and machine learning competitions. Details about the transaction remain somewhat vague, but given that Google is hosting its Cloud Next conference in San Francisco this week, the official announcement could come as early as tomorrow.\n\nKaggle, which was founded in 2010 by Anthony Goldbloom and Ben Hamner, boasts over 500,000 data scientists on its platform. Google and Kaggle have already worked together in the past, and are currently teaming up on a $100,000 competition to accurately classify YouTube videos.\n\nIn all likelihood, Google values Kaggle for its deep user base, rather than any proprietary technology, which is a bit of a departure from its usual penchant for cutting edge intellectual property.\n\nSince the deal still hasn’t officially been announced, financial details of the transaction aren’t yet known. Kaggle has raised about $12.5 million in several rounds of financing since its establishment nearly seven years ago.\n\nAlphabet Inc shares were trading at $854.97 per share on Wednesday morning, up $3.82 (+0.45%).

However, experts are increasingly warning about overvalued issues and market bubbles — a theme that likely won’t fade this week.\n\nA number of tech stocks have stolen the spotlight heading into Monday’s trade. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ: BBRY ) made waves over the weekend, while Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) was getting batted around after a Monday morning headline.\n\nHere’s what you need to know going into today’s trade:\n\nTesla Inc (TSLA)\n\nTSLA stock is down Monday after the company’s shares were knocked down a peg by the analyst community.\n\nGoldman Sachs downgraded Tesla shares on Monday morning, dragging the company down from “Neutral” to “Sell.”\n\nAnalyst David Tamberrino says:\n\n“While we believe Tesla currently has a lead relative to OEM peers with respect to vehicle technology adoption, electric vehicle architecture, and (potentially) battery scale, our concerns are more near-term oriented with respect to operational execution on the Model 3 launch, an unproven solar business, and cash needs. Ultimately we see a delayed launch (pushing volume growth out and to the right) and FCF burn rate (necessitating a capital raise before 4Q17) to weigh on TSLA’s shares.”\n\nTamberrino also worries that the SolarCity acquisition “increased the risk profile of Tesla amidst a business model transition,” and lowered the price target slightly from $190 to $185.\n\nTesla is coming off a fourth-quarter earnings report during which it was announced that CFO Jason Wheeler would be exiting in April — a surprising move that has drawn a little scrutiny from the investment community.\n\nTSLA shares are off more than 2% this morning.\n\nAlphabet Inc (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet announced that one of its artificial intelligence products will be available in more of the company’s products moving forward.\n\nGoogle Assistant will now be available in the company’s tablets, smartphones, computers and smartwatches for anyone using Android 6.0 Marshmallow or higher. It can even be used on smart TV systems such as Nvidia Shield TV and AI car systems.\n\nGoogle Assistant is Alphabet’s virtual assistant app that competes with the likes of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Siri and Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Alexa. You can use GA for a number of purposes, from general search to checking the weather to playing music.\n\nNext Page', 'Let\'s rewind back to September 1998. Steve Jobs had just rejoined the company he had founded two decades earlier: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Two 20-somethings named Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded a company they thought could help organize the world\'s information: Google -- which later became Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nThe former was worth just over $5 billion, while the latter was worth virtually nothing. Fast-forward not even two decades and they are arguably the two most powerful companies the world has ever known, with a combined market capitalization of almost $1.2 trillion!\n\nBut which stock is a better buy at today\'s prices?\n\nThere\'s no definitive way to answer that question. However, there are many different ways to approach it that will help you get more comfortable picking one of these two titans. Here are the three aspects that I consider to be most important.\n\nFinancial fortitude\n\nToo much cash is a good problem to have. Over the long run, owning a company that has this kind of cash ""problem"" is very desirable. That\'s because when difficult times hit -- and they will hit -- companies that have cash have options. They can outspend their more cash-strapped rivals, buy back their own stock, or even make acquisitions.\n\nCompanies that are debt-heavy, on the other hand, find themselves in the exact opposite boat: struggling just to make ends meet, exploring options to be bought out, or even succumbing to bankruptcy.\n\nHere\'s how Apple and Alphabet stack up in terms of financial fortitude.\n\nCompany Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Alphabet $78 billion $2 billion $19 billion $24 billion Apple $238 billion $75 billion $46 billion $53 billion\n\nIt would be very difficult to find two companies that have stronger balance sheets. While it\'s clear that Apple\'s numbers are greater than Alphabet\'s -- even after accounting for the fact that Apple is valued 11% higher than Alphabet -- the point of this lens is to see if one company has substantially more flexibility due to its cash than another.\n\nOnce we get to the point that these two companies are at, it\'s essentially a wash.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nSustainable competitive advantages\n\nOf these three factors, this is perhaps the most important. Commonly referred to as a ""moat"" in investing circles, a company\'s sustainable competitive advantages are often the special sauce that separate it from competitors.\n\nSome might be surprised to hear that I think Alphabet has a much stronger moat than Apple. Apple\'s moat is two-fold. First, it has a very powerful brand -- even more so abroad. That allows the company to charge more for its products than competitors. Second, the company has been building out an ecosystem that keeps users hooked in the system. For example, if your iPhone is synced with your Mac, your iPad, and your Apple TV, you\'d be loath to switch to a different phone.\n\nBut the major weakness here is that the company has traditionally relied on coming up with ""the next big thing"" to drive sales. The iPhone was arguably one of the biggest consumer hits ever, but it has been a long time since Apple has released a product that even comes close to touching the iPhone\'s popularity, and the competition is always clawing for market share.\n\nAlphabet, on the other hand, has the type of moat that famed investor Charlie Munger once said might be the widest he\'d ever seen. That\'s because Google has a dominant search market share globally. But search is just one of seven Alphabet products that have over 1 billion users. The others are: Android, Chrome, Maps, Google Play Store, Gmail, and YouTube.\n\nThink about Alphabet\'s moat like this: With each additional user that gets in Google\'s ecosystem, the company collects copious amounts of data, all of which can be used to offer advertising that\'s more targeted than anywhere in the world. In the end, those ads are what pays the bills at Alphabet, and with the exception of Facebook, there isn\'t a company (or government) on earth that can come close to Alphabet\'s data trove.\n\nWinner: Alphabet\n\nValuation\n\nFinally, we have valuation. This isn\'t an exact science, but here are four metrics I like to check when evaluating stocks.\n\nCompany P/E Ratio P/FCF Ratio PEG Ratio Dividend Alphabet 24 24 1.3 0% Apple 14 12 1.5 2%\n\nWhile Alphabet appears to be slightly cheaper relative to its growth potential (PEG ratio), Apple is a better deal on every other metric. It\'s tough to find a company as successful as Apple that\'s trading for quite so cheap. And the fact that you get a 2% dividend -- which is both safe and has room for growth -- is the icing on the cake that makes Apple the winner of this round.\n\nWinner: Apple\n\nFinal call: Draw\n\nBoth companies are solid. Apple is the cheaper stock; Alphabet has a stronger moat. As a tie-breaker, I go where my own skin in the game is: I\'d definitely side with Alphabet. The company represents 13% of my family\'s real-life holdings, while Apple clocks in at just under 4%.', 'If I told investors at the beginning of 2016 that Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) would be getting beaten after 49 weeks of the year by 374 out of the 502 companies in the S&P 500, many of you would have thought I was off my rocker. But that’s exactly where GOOGL stock sits with a few weeks to go left in the trading year.\n\nSource: Google\n\nAlphabet shares were up just 1.7% year-to-date through Dec. 8. “Imagine that,” my mother-in-law would say in her best Maritime accent.\n\nHowever, if you’ve never owned GOOGL stock, don’t be put off by its lack of performance in 2016. It’s a must-own stock for any investment portfolio.\n\nHere are three reasons why I feel this way.\n\nGOOGL Stock Key #1: “Other Revenues”\n\nYou might think that Google is nothing more than a glorified advertising company — after all, 89% of the $76.1 billion in annual revenue Alphabet generated through the end of September came from its ad business — but you’d be mistaken.\n\nIn Q3 2016, GOOGL generated $2.4 billion in other revenues, 39% higher year-over-year and 12% sequentially. This represented 10.9% of the Google segment’s overall revenue of $22.3 billion. For the first nine months of the year, Google’s other revenues came to $6.7 billion, 31% higher than a year earlier. There’s nothing insignificant about this kind of revenue. On its own, it would be a decent-sized business.\n\nThe two biggest components of its other revenues: Google Cloud and Google Play.\n\nWhile the advertising revenue generated by Google Play is included in the websites sub-segment of Google, the apps and media content sold in the Google Play store falls under other revenues. With the global mobile app market expected to surpass $100 billion by 2020, Google’s revenues in this area will jump exponentially.\n\nOn the cloud side of the ledger, GOOGL has been playing a weak game of catch-up with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), but the Q3 numbers suggest that’s starting to change for the better.\n\nKeep an eye on this number. As long as other revenues continue to grow as a percentage of Google’s overall revenue, Alphabet’s winning.\n\nGOOGL Stock Key #2: “Other Bets”\n\nThe “Other Bets” — not to be confused with “other revenues” — are the various businesses Alphabet owns outside its legacy Google segment. They include Nest, Verily, Access, X, etc. and represent the company’s constant push for innovation.\n\nThey’re also big-time money losers.\n\nIn the 12 months ended Sept. 30, they collectively lost $3.8 billion. Most of the early stage revenue is generated by Nest (thermostats, CO2 sensors), Access (Google Fiber) and Verily (contact lenses, healthcare analytics).\n\nIn the first nine months of 2016, its Other Bets saw revenues increase 85% year-over-year to $595 million, but still less than 1% of the legacy business’s overall revenue.\n\nInnovation, while at the heart of the Other Bets’ DNA, can’t be carried out in a bubble. Profits do matter. When Alphabet was created, entrepreneurial leaders such as former Nest CEO and co-founder Tony Fadell felt hamstrung by a new financial discipline that asked more of its so-called “moonshots.” He left in June.\n\nWhile that’s temporarily slowed innovation at Nest, ultimately it looks to be the first Other Bets business to actually make money.\n\nNext Page', ""Is FB Stock Now A Better Bet Than GOOGL Stock?\n\nSize hasn’t stopped Alphabet from growing in double digits .\n\n. What is the real potential impact of Facebook’s growth on Google ad revenues?\n\nCan Google fend them off, and how can you benefit from this duel?\n\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock price has been nearly flat in the last twelve months despite the company posting average YoY revenue growth of 19.65% in the last three quarters. The double digit growth rate is staggering because Alphabet’s quarterly revenues are already well over $20 billion. What’s even more surprising though, is the meek response from the market, which decided to completely overlook the strong growth numbers. Now with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) doing a stellar job both financially, and in terms of stock performance, comparisons are being drawn again. Can Facebook really dent Alphabet Inc?\n\nA Valuation Problem?\n\nOne of the major factors that resulted in the market’s muted reaction is Alphabet’s current valuation. The stock is already trading above 6 times sales and 28 times earnings, which is a bit on the high side for a technology company of Alphabet’s size and scale. A lot of that double-digit growth seems to have been already priced in and, as a result, the stock kept moving sideways.\n\nThe other factor that is also playing an important role is the growth expectation. The online advertising industry still has plenty of room to grow, but a large portion of that growth will come from developing markets that are comparatively less profitable than developed markets, and also due to the shift from desktop to mobile.\n\nThe impact of that shift can already be seen in the way Alphabet’s aggregate cost per click has declined in the last two years. At the same time, the total number of clicks has increased. The shift to mobile as well as the increasing traffic from new markets are jointly giving more click volume, but lower revenue per click. This trend will continue, it is not something that Alphabet can snap itself out of that easily; and in all likelihood we might see this accelerate in the next few years as mobile usage in developing markets increases. (See Also: FB Stock: Is Facebook Inc (FB) Eating YouTube's Lunch- Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) ?)\n\nMargins Gaining Stability, and No Competitor Breathing Down its Neck\n\nGoogle’s operating margin has been coming down as result of these changes but, thankfully, the numbers are a tad more stable this year. The decline in operating margins was not because Alphabet had to cut down its pricing because of competition, but more because of the shift in market dynamics we discussed above.\n\nDespite the decline, however, Alphabet’s advertising machine remains a cash cow for the company and will remain that way for many more years to come, as there is no clear rival that can give an advertiser more leverage for its ad dollars.\n\nFacebook (NASDAQ:FB) might have overtaken Alphabet in the news traffic referral race, but the company is still many years away from the market leader in terms of revenues. Traffic referral is basically the volume of web visits that go to a website after users have clicked a link. With Google, it’s about clicks on search results, news links and so on; with Facebook, it’s about clicks to advertised or organic linked posts.\n\nThe Facebook threat is certainly there for Alphabet, but there’s plenty of time before the social media giant can mount a full-scale attack on Google revenue streams. Again, with the shift to mobile, Facebook benefits from increased traffic and ad revenues, but it’s far behind in the video space, which YouTube will continue to dominate for the foreseeable future.\n\n“YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView, with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager.” - Sundar Pichai, CEO, Google\n\nAlso Read: Why AAPL Stock Is Better Investment Than GOOGL Stock Going Into 2017: Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc\n\nTable for Two, Please!\n\nThat balance will keep Facebook at bay for now, but there’s also another factor to consider. The online advertising market might be growing at a rapid pace, but has yet to ‘come of age’, as it were. Print advertising may have taken a hit in the last five years, but television still holds the lion’s share of ad revenues globally.\n\nSource: Intelliassist\n\nThat means the growth opportunity isn’t only there for newer players like Facebook; it is very much there for Alphabet as well, as they’ve shown over recent quarters.\n\nTherefore, it stands to reason that even if Facebook is able to show rapid growth - and they’ve already warned of reaching optimal ad loads - over the next few quarters, all Alphabet needs to do is keep their own double digit growth intact for them to fend off Facebook.\n\nIn Summary\n\nPut all these factors together and it’s clear that the runway is long for Alphabet’s Google. Notwithstanding the fact that Other Bets have largely shown disappointing results until now, the ad engine is sufficiently primed to sustain whatever growth levels Google is experiencing at this point.\n\nFor an investor, the only cause for worry will be the valuation of 6+ times sales. Your returns may take a while to come, so do give yourself some margin for error. The best way is to build your position over a period of time, especially during dips. That way, you get to keep your cost basis down as much as possible, yet accrue value to your portfolio over time.\n\nLooking for great tech stocks? Check out our top technology stock picks, which have beaten the NASDAQ by over 110%."", 'Highlighting a somewhat muted response from investors, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is trading about 0.4% lower at the time of this writing on Friday after the company reported its results for the fourth quarter of 2016. While revenue jumped 22% to $26.1 billion and surpassed analysts\' consensus estimate (via Thomson Reuters) for revenue of $25.2 billion, the company\'s earnings of $9.36 per share fell short of a projection for $9.64.\n\nAs investors digest the information from Alphabet\'s latest report, here\'s a look at some of the most insightful comments from the company\'s fourth-quarter earnings call. In these quotes, management discusses the success of the new Google-branded hardware, further opportunity in advertising, and what it considers the three biggest bets for the company beyond its core ad business.\n\nAlphabet\'s core search business hasn\'t peaked -- far from it\n\nAfter pointing to the company\'s impressive 20% consolidated revenue growth in 2016, which management emphasized is actually 24% when excluding the impact of currency headwinds, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat emphasized (via a Reuters transcript) the opportunity ahead:\n\nThis performance is a testament to the ongoing innovation that is driving our success in mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising, each of which we believe has only begun to scratch the surface. We remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped.\n\nThese could become major revenue drivers\n\nWith about 86% of Alphabet\'s total revenue coming from advertising, it\'s always nice to get an update on whether the company is seeing success on diversifying its revenue sources. To this end, Alphabet made excellent progress in its fourth quarter. Here\'s what Porat had to say:\n\nAlongside these [advertising] businesses, we are focused on growing additional revenue streams within Google over the medium- and long-term. In 2016, our other revenue line grew 41% on a full year basis reflecting the growth in our Play, hardware and cloud businesses. We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube. We\'re investing in our cloud and hardware businesses, as well as our newer non-ad revenue sources for YouTube, in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years.\n\nAlphabet\'s other revenue growth in the Google segment (not to be confused with Alphabet\'s ""other bets"") was even more impressive in the company\'s fourth quarter specifically. Fourth-quarter other revenue soared 62% year over year, to $3.4 billion, accounting for 13% of total revenue, up from 10% of revenue in the year-ago quarter. Management cited hardware, the Google Play app store, and its cloud business as key drivers for the segment.\n\nGoogle-branded hardware looks promising\n\nDrilling down more narrowly on the company\'s nascent hardware business, which received some extra attention from the company in the fourth quarter when Google launched its voice-activated smart speaker (Google Home) and a new smartphone (Google Pixel), management was optimistic about how new hardware is performing in the marketplace. Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained:\n\nWe introduced a new family of beautiful hardware devices in October that are made by Google, led by Google Home and our Pixel phone which feature the Google Assistant built in. We\'re thrilled with the reception, as well as the really happy customers we saw over the holiday season. In particular, Google Home was a very popular present that many people opened on Christmas morning. We have committed to this for the long-term, as a great way to bring a beautiful seamless Google experience to people. The early signs are promising, and you can expect us to see us expand our offerings thoughtfully.\n\nAlphabet\'s three big bets\n\nPichai said that beyond its core advertising business, the company distinctly views ""YouTube, cloud and hardware"" as ""three of our biggest bets."" So investors should keep an eye on these areas as Alphabet continues to grow its business.\n\nManagement\'s extreme confidence in incremental opportunity in Alphabet\'s core search business, along with significant and promising growth in YouTube, cloud, and hardware, continues to make a great case for owning this stock. Not only is the company strengthening the competitive position of its core business, but it\'s also diversifying its revenue while simultaneously opening the doors to meaningful opportunities beyond advertising.', 'Alphabet Inc.

In particular, both analysts are impressed with Google’s robust revenue that rose above expectation. The tech giant’s success does not seem to be stopping any time soon.\n\nLet’s dive in:\n\nThe Aegis Take: Expect Continued Growth\n\nAegis analyst Victor Anthony commends Alphabet’s fourth-quarter revenue outperformance, attributing the robust results to hardware sales coupled with Cloud. Moreover, even though the analyst acknowledges that the giant had an EPS miss, he believes without expenses and higher taxes, there would have been a beat on this front as well.\n\nAs such, on back of a strong quarter, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on GOOGL while raising the price target to $1,011, which represents a just under 20% increase from where the shares last closed.\n\nFrom Anthony’s perspective, the real “pain point” for investors points to back-to-back quarters of segment margin contraction, even as he notes that in a bigger picture context company margins did expand.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Alphabet posted net revenue that saw a 22.8% year-over-year rise to $21.2 billion, and a 20.9% increase from the third quarter, beating the analyst’s estimate by 3.8% and consensus by 3%. The giant’s websites revenue growth surged 20.3% year-over-year, which though experienced “tough comps,” still was just over the analyst’s expectations. Strong assets in Search and YouTube with a 43% year-over-year rise in paid clicks growth and network revenue growth rising 7% year-over-year have Alphabet in a stellar position.\n\n“The source of the margin compression is now well-known by Google investors – mobile, hardware, programmatic, YouTube content – all of which are growth areas for Google. Our feeling is that investors will need to accept the margin pressures for a few quarters and look to the overall company margin expansion on pared-back losses at Other Bets. The model continues to benefit from multiple secular tailwinds (search, video, programmatic, Play, Cloud and now hardware and AI and Machine Learning), management is buying back stock, advertising growth remains in the 20% range, the balance sheet is solid with $86B or $125/share in cash, and the multiple is cheap relative to peers. Current tracking data points to continued strong growth at YouTube, and Search has many new and updated ad units that should drive continued strong growth,” Anthony surmises.\n\nIn reaction, the analyst lifts his 2017 net revenue projection to $88.319 billion while increasing his 2017 GAAP EPS projection to $34.33, taking into account strength in hardware coupled with accelerated advertising growth.\n\nAs usual, we like to include the analyst’s track record when reporting on new analyst notes to give a perspective on the effect it has on stock performance. According to TipRanks, five-star analyst Victor Anthony is ranked #107 out of 4,378 analysts. Anthony has a 65% success rate and realizes 12.6% in his annual returns. When recommending GOOGL, Anthony yields 9.5% in average profits on the stock.\n\nThe Jefferies Take: Alphabet Is a Franchise Pick\n\nJefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald likewise cheers Alphabet’s revenue outclass, highlighting that between a triple threat of mobile search, YouTube, and hardware, GOOGL has hit its best growth in revenue since the first quarter of 2012. Meanwhile, Fitzgerald underscores mobile search remains the #1 driver of the tech giant’s revenue for the sixth consecutive quarter.\n\nTherefore, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on GOOGL with a price target of $1,000, which represents an 18% increase from where the stock is currently trading.\n\nFitzgerald affirms, “Alphabet revenue beat with strength again coming from mobile search and YouTube. But higher costs for TAC, hardware, and a large 1x Cost of Revenue expense drove an EPS miss. From a capital allocation standpoint, we appreciate Alphabet is investing in strategic, promising areas like Google Assistant and hardware, while pausing investment in less rewarding areas like Fiber. Trading at 15x (ex-cash), GOOGL remains a franchise pick.”\n\nFurthermore, the analyst connects strength in hardware to the giant’s foray into artificial intelligence, opining, “Google likely sold < $1B of hardware in 4Q. GOOGL’s hardware showcases its prowess in Artificial Intelligence, and as such we view the hardware and software businesses as highly complimentary. Note hardware does drive higher cost of revenue.”\n\nMoving forward, “We believe online video is the biggest online ad growth driver and YouTube is the premier vehicle to play that trend,” Fitzgerald concludes.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, which measures analysts’ and bloggers’ success rate based on how their calls perform, five-star analyst Brian Fitzgerald is ranked #169 out of 4,378 analysts. Fitzgerald has a 70% success rate and earns 13.7% in his yearly returns. When suggesting GOOGL, Fitzgerald gains 10.0% in average profits on the stock.\n\nTipRanks analytics exhibit GOOGL as a Strong Buy. Based on 28 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 27 rate a Buy on Alphabet stock while 1 maintains a Hold. The 12-month average price target stands at $984.63, marking a nearly 15% upside from where the shares last closed.', 'Insider Trading Activity For Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nDavid C Drummond , SVP of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) reportedly Sold 2,000 shares of the company’s stock at an average price of 852.42 for a total transaction amount of $1,704,840.00 SEC Form\n\nInsider Trading History For Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nOn 8/13/2012 Kavitark Ram Shriram, Director, sold 50,200 with an average share price of $650.10 per share and the total transaction amounting to $32,635,020.00.

(NASDAQ: QCOM ). The development kit is for untethered VR headsets that use Android, but it isn’t the same as what users get from a smartphone.\n\nThe version of Android that is being used in the Qualcomm, Inc. development kit may give an insight into Alphabet Inc’s future VR efforts. It has a separate overlay of its own. GOOG’s current VR focus is with Daydream. This has users inserting their smartphones into a cradle for a VR experience.\n\nThe big difference between Alphabet Inc’s current VR efforts and the development kit from Qualcomm, Inc. is the untethered aspect of it. Untethered VR headsets will operate completely on their own. Users won’t need a smartphone or a computer to use them, reports Computer World.\n\nQualcomm, Inc. is hoping that its new development kits for untethered VR headsets will bring some sense of stability to the market. It is trying to ensure that different headsets are consistent. It also wants to reduce the nausea that can sometimes come with VR headsets.\n\nThe development kits for untethered VR headsets will come out during the second quarter of 2017. Qualcomm, Inc. is also launching an accelerator program to help original design manufacturers build their own untethered VR headsets.

This is something that's been kind of up in the air for a while. At times, they've talked about not wanting to be a car manufacturer, but it's hard to take them at face value there, because they're looking to obscure this as much as possible. You want to talk a little bit about what we got in terms of commentary there?\n\nDaniel Sparks: Yeah, that was one of the big takeaways when they were coming out with this Waymo announcement. There was some speculation that Alphabet could be working on its own Google-branded car. While they might not actually have thought of planning of manufacturing it, as they do with their hardware products, they often outsource the manufacturing and then slap that brand on, similar to the way Apple does with Foxconn, but, there was some speculation that they could try to be working on some Google-branded car, and we have seen their cars with no steering wheel, their ambitious vision of a totally autonomous driving experience. There has been some speculation in the past that they would be planning to bring a larger fleet of those to the market. But the CEO of Waymo, John Krafcik -- I think that's how you pronounce it?\n\nLewis: I think it's pronounced another way, but I'm not sure. I've only seen it and writing, I have not heard it said. I understand how neither of us are totally sure.\n\nSparks: OK, that sounds better, we'll go with that. We'll just call him John today. John, he emphasized that they're not trying to turn into a car business, but rather wanting to focus on the technology behind the cars, and basically, Waymo's mission to make driving autonomous, to make it safer, and, as in their name, really focus on the mobility. I think this is a good move. This is something that Alphabet has succeeded at in the past by really focusing on software and gathering data -- because, essentially, that's the company's core mission, to organize data. So, by doing this, I'm actually more bullish on the segment by seeing that they're really going to focus on their core competencies with it. And maybe similar to the way Alphabet tries to add in Google-branded hardware later on with Android, maybe they'll do a similar things with cars by trying to bring in Google-branded cars later on after they've really developed and honed in on their expertise and the autonomous area of the technology."", ""If both parties agree to enter into a formal agreement, Honda R&D engineers based in Silicon Valley, California and Tochigi, Japan, would work closely with Waymo engineers based in Mountain View, California and Novi, Michigan.\n\nHonda previously announced its intention to put production vehicles with automated driving capabilities on highways sometime around 2020 related to its goal of a collision-free society. In addition to these on-going efforts, this technical collaboration with Waymo could allow Honda R&D to explore a different technological approach to bring fully self-driving technology to market. These discussions are an initial step that will allow Waymo and Honda R&D to further explore the potential of a broad range of automated driving technologies.\n\nAbout Honda R&D Co, Ltd.\n\nHonda R&D Co., Ltd. is an independent subsidiary company of Honda Motor Co., Ltd. and serves as Honda's primary research and development organization for the company's automobile, motorcycle, power products and aviation products. Based on over half a century of accumulated engineering expertise, Honda R&D seeks to actively lead the way through new technologies and resources to define the future of mobility. Honda R&D is playing a central role in the development of Honda's automated driving technologies, with responsibility for the entire process from fundamental research to product development.

We're determined to improve transportation for people around the world, building on software and sensor technology developed in Google's labs since 2009. In October 2015, we achieved the world's first fully self-driving trip on public roads, in a car without a steering wheel or pedals. We refine Waymo technology through one billion miles of simulation testing each year, and our cars have self-driven over two million miles on public roads across four U.S. cities.\n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/honda-and-alphabet-incs-waymo-enter-discussions-on-technical-collaboration-of-fully-self-driving-automobile-technology-300382794.html\n\nSOURCE Honda Motor Co., Ltd\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://world.honda.com/RandD\n\n"", 'Honda Motor Co. said Wednesday it is talking to Waymo, the autonomous driving unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc., to try to strike a deal that would put its self-driving technology into some of the Japanese automaker’s cars.\n\nBoth companies stressed that the talks are about research, rather than full production vehicles, at this point. If all goes well, Honda may provide Waymo with vehicles that are modified to run the self-driving system, and those cars would join the existing Waymo fleet currently being tested in four U.S. cities.\n\nDiscussions with Honda underscore that Waymo wants develop the brains behind self-driving vehicle technology rather than build the cars that use it. The talks also show that Waymo, the new name of Google’s Self-Driving Car Project, is eager to work with more car companies as it races to rack up test miles with its autonomous-drive systems and prepare it for commercialization.\n\n“For companies like Apple and Google, it makes more sense to supply the technology than to get into the car business, which is capital intensive and highly regulated,’’ said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Cox Automotive’s Autotrader.com. “It makes sense for them to provide their technology to companies that are already making cars.’’\n\nWaymo already has a deal with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, which has built 100 Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid minivans equipped with its computers and a suite of sensors, telematics and other systems. FCA’s vehicles will join the company’s fleet of self-driving cars early next year.\n\nGeneral Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. tried to strike deals with Google’s self-driving unit last year, but were unable to do so.\n\nAutomakers had been wary of working with Google, thinking the internet search giant could dominate their businesses, but that attitude is changing, said Mark Bünger, a vice president covering digital transformation at Lux Research.\n\nHonda shares rose 1.2 percent to 3,570 yen as of the close in Tokyo trading Thursday, compared with a 0.1 percent decline for the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.\n\nFirst Step\n\nHonda previously announced plans to start selling self-driving cars capable of operating on highways sometime around 2020. That effort will continue, the company said in a statement. But with Waymo’s help, Honda said it could start considering different technical pathways.\n\n“These discussions are an initial step that will allow Waymo and Honda R&D to further explore the potential of a broad range of automated driving technologies,’’ the automaker said in the statement.\n\nAlphabet announced last week that it was separating the car project into a free-standing business called Waymo as it seeks to sharpen its focus on changing the transportation industry.\n\nJohn Krafcik, who’d previously worked in management at Ford Motor Co. and as chief executive for Hyundai Motor Co.’s U.S. sales unit, is CEO of Waymo.\n\nFrustrating Progress\n\nThe Google project lost several top executives this year as some members of the team were frustrated by the pace of progress, especially as traditional automakers and rivals like Uber Technologies Inc. and Tesla Motors Inc. develop their own autonomous-vehicle systems. After revealing the company name last week, Krafcik didn’t offer any details on Waymo’s plans for a viable commercial business.\n\n“It shows a lot of momentum for the self-driving car project, which had seemed to stall just a few months ago,"" Lux’s Bünger said. ""It matters a lot in the sense that there will be more self-driving cars sooner, available from a variety of automakers.”\n\nWaymo said in a statement it’s ""looking forward to exploring opportunities to collaborate with Honda to advance fully self-driving technology and make our roads safer.""\n\nJapan’s third-largest automaker, meanwhile, inherited a legacy of fierce independence from its founder Soichiro Honda, who died in 1991. Wednesday’s announcement reflects the growing credibility of Waymo’s self-driving technologies. It also shows the immense strain automakers face not just in the race toward self-driving, but also in the simultaneous upheavals taking place in ride-sharing and the electrification of the engines to meet emissions limits.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nWhile cautious regarding the need for drivers to maintain responsibility for vehicle operation, Honda has made its semi-autonomous technology package, called Honda Sensing, available on affordable models including its compact Civic. Similar packages of features such as lane-keep assist and adaptive cruise control are typically found on luxury models such as the Volvo XC90, Lexus LS 460 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\n\nPartnering with Waymo should help Honda speed development of its own self-driving systems or decide to use what the Google unit has developed.\n\n“If you’re Honda, and you’re a master craftsman, and you have the opportunity to partner with the leading provider of technology in this space, maybe you learn something,” said Mike Ramsey, research director at Gartner Inc.', ""Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is set to report results for its fourth quarter of 2016 on Thursday, Jan. 26. Before the numbers for the quarter are released, here's a broad overview of some areas to watch.\n\nRevenue and EPS\n\nThe pressure is certainly on for Alphabet's fourth quarter, especially after the company's expectation-beating quarter before it. For Alphabet's third quarter, both the company's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) exceeded expectations. Revenue and non-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting principles) EPS was $22.5 billion and $9.06, respectively, up significantly from $18.7 billion and $7.35, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, on average, expected third-quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $22.1 billion and $8.63.\n\nGoing into Alphabet's fourth quarter, analysts expect robust growth to continue, albeit not as sharply. On average, analysts expect fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $25.1 billion and $9.63, up 18% and 11%, respectively, year over year.\n\nMetric Q3 YOY Growth Q3 YOY Growth Implied by Consensus Analyst Estimate Revenue 20% 18% Non-GAAP EPS 23% 11%\n\nThere's merit to analysts' conservatism, particularly since Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat went out of her way during the company's third-quarter earnings call to remind analysts that the company will be up against tough year-ago revenue comparisons in the fourth quarter.\n\nPaid clicks and cost-per-clicks\n\nOne of the reasons why Alphabet outperformed expectations in Q3 was because of its big increase in paid clicks, or the total number of clicks for which advertisers paid Google. Aggregate paid clicks in Q3 were up 9% sequentially and 33% year over year. Notably, some of the benefits from such a large increase in paid clicks was offset by 5% and 11% decreases in cost-per-click, or the amount advertisers pay Alphabet for each click, but the outsized gain in paid clicks was significant enough to help drive significant revenue growth.\n\nInvestors should look for look for similar trends in Alphabet's paid clicks and cost-per-clicks in Q4. If the trends diverge in an unexpected direction, investors may want to look for an explanation from management during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nNew Google products\n\nAlso, after launching some new Google-branded hardware, investors also may want to look for some updates from management on how these products are faring. While the new products still almost certainly will be immaterial to overall results, a promising start for the new devices could signal bigger opportunity ahead.\n\nIn October, Alphabet launched two new significant products: a Google Pixel smartphone and a Google Home artificial intelligence-enabled smart speaker. The Pixel quickly sold out online, and Google Home ended up selling out in many stores during the holidays -- evidence of the high demand for these new products. Indeed, in a statement to 9to5Google, a Google spokesperson specifically said demand was to blame for the Pixel selling out:\n\nWe're thrilled to see the excitement for our new Pixel phones, and frankly pre-order demand has exceeded our expectations. We're working to restock our inventory as soon as possible.\n\nWhile Alphabet hasn't yet proven it can build a sustainable and meaningful hardware business, maybe the Pixel smartphone and Google Home could finally change this.\n\nAlphabet will report its fourth-quarter results immediately after market close on Jan. 26. Management will host a conference call to discuss the results at 4:30 p.m. EST."", 'What’s the first thing you think about when it comes to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL )? There’s a good chance that Search is at the top of your list. After all, its former namesake search site has been driving the cash flows and profits at GOOGL stock for years. Especially since it has data-mined those results to sell plenty of ads and generate significant advertising revenues.\n\nSource: Google\n\nBut Google isn’t a one-trick pony.\n\nLike rivals such as Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), GOOGL has become one heck of a device and products maker. And while it’s easy to dismiss these gadgets as “hobby business” or non-core operations, the reality is, they are paramount to Google’s underlying mission and business.\n\nIn the end, device growth — and what Google does with those devices — is the real driver for GOOGL stock.\n\nOver 157 Products at Google\n\nIn total, GOOGL makes over 157 different products for customers. And while the vast bulk of them are Web-based applications — Gmail, Maps, Chrome, etc. — the firm has continued to plow some big-time dollars onto the physical device market.\n\nThat may make GOOGL investors a tad bit nervous considering how poorly of an investment Motorola turned out to be for Google. If you remember, GOOGL paid more than $12 billion for the cellphone manufacturer, only to sell it at steep $10 billion loss a few years later. But what Google kept in the sale — some valuable technology patents and applications — is what is going to drive Alphabet’s dominance over the device market.\n\nIn recent months, Alphabet has launched new home artificial intelligence equipment, smartphones, virtual reality headsets and home WiFi units. These products join GOOGL’s cadre of Nest WiFi-enabled thermostats and home automation products, Chromebooks and tablets. You name it.\n\nAnd while many of these items are very impressive in their technology and have caught on with consumers — Nest and its Pixel phones in particular — none of these devices have become huge money makers for Alphabet. Revenues for Google’s physical tools are pretty non-existent and in some products, are actually losses.\n\nSo why would Google want even to dabble in device market? It seems that it should just be focusing on ways to continue generating ad sales from is core search operations. But building out ad sales is exactly what GOOGL is doing. To understand why we just need to look at one of its competitors.\n\nBig Data Opportunity for GOOGL Stock\n\nAmazon’s Fire Tablet and new Echo home device aren’t really about making your life easier — it’s about selling you that next movie or book. It’s a way to distribute Amazon’s content and products. In all of this, Amazon is collecting tons of data on your preferences — by what you click and say — to sell you more items down the road.\n\nAnd that is exactly what GOOGL is doing.\n\nIf you’re not searching for something or checking your email, Google has no idea what you’re up to. But slap a home automation device on your wall, smartwatch on your wrist and AI chip in your car, and suddenly Big Brother knows what you’re all about. And in that data collection is where Alphabet is going to thrive.\n\nNext Page', 'By Gaurav S. Iyer, IFC Published : January 12, 2017\n\nA More Streamlined Google Stock (GOOG)\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is reportedly trying to sell one of its satellite divisions, a business that it bought in 2014 for $500.0 million. This sale would suggest Alphabet’s upper management is getting serious about cost-cutting, and that they are willing to do the dirty work needed to ensure a bright future for Google stock (GOOG).\n\nA competing satellite-imagery firm named Planet Labs Inc. wants to take the business off Alphabet’s hands, but it is still a small startup.\n\nThe hope is that it can raise enough money to complete a “cash plus equity deal,” which would suggest that Alphabet will retain some stake in the enterprise even after selling it. (Source: “Google in Talks to Sell Its Satellite Business,” The Wall Street Journal, January 10, 2017.)\n\nBut the important point to remember is that any associated costs will get wiped off the company’s income statement. That is a really big deal for Google stock, not because this satellite business was terrible or anything, but because it shows commitment to shareholder value.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, Google has thrown money around without a second thought. To be fair, its monopoly over the search engine market was so absolute that it could afford to do that. As the online advertising business grew bigger, GOOG stock continued to rise.\n\nThis was the basic equation that propelled Google stock over the last decade and a half.\n\nThe internet behemoth managed to stay atop the tech world by playing the odds. It would invest in a bunch of interesting new technologies with the hopes that one or two of them would eventually become a product. That’s how “Android,” “Maps,” and the “Chromecast” came into existence.\n\nBut now it’s time for a little belt-tightening. In order to keep Google stock moving “up and to the right” there needs to be more money-makers and fewer science projects. If you take a close look at what Alphabet has been doing over the last year, it’s pretty clear that it’s making the right moves.\n\nFor instance, it spun the driverless car project into a full-fledged business called “Waymo” (yes, I know it’s a terrible name, but it could be a golden goose) and unveiled a fleet of self-driving minivans. (Source: “A first look at our Waymo fully self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans,” Medium, December 18, 2016.)\n\nSince Waymo isn’t manufacturing the cars, but simply licensing the technology to carmakers like Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) or Toyota Motor Corp (ADR) (NYSE:TM), it could become a profit center much sooner than other firms in the same industry.\n\nWe’re talking billions of dollars here. Put that in perspective with the imminent sale of Alphabet’s satellite-imagery business. What you’ll see is a company that is focused, a company that is slashing unnecessary costs and cranking up its earning potential.\n\nFrom a fundamentals perspective, this would suggest that Google stock is grossly underrated. We expect the share price to explode this year, particularly in the third and fourth quarters.', 'Shares of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) rebounded nicely following their short-lived but sharp post-earnings selloff in late January. This very ability of GOOGL stock to recover so quickly speaks to underlying demand and a multimonth uptrend that active investors and traders must respect until proven otherwise.\n\nWhen I last discussed Alphabet stock on Jan. 9, I said that shares appeared to have good upside potential into late January. I wanted to target the $845-$850 area before the Jan. 26 earnings report.

Alphabet Inc., formerly known as Google Inc., is headquartered in Mountain View, California.', 'All too much like James Cameron’s 2009 sci-fi flick Avatar, just when you think the feud between Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL ) is over, you find out it’s not.* Last week, the iconic database company told the iconic search engine company it was appealing a ruling made against Oracle — in favor of Alphabet — in May of last year.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFor better or worse, GOOGL stock owners either didn’t hear, or didn’t care. If it’s the latter, it’s not terribly surprising. The company formerly known as Google is sued on a regular basis, often by parties with weak cases just looking for a payday.\n\nGOOGL shareholders may want to take a closer look this time around though. While successful appeal cases are tough, Oracle’s argument holds slightly more water than the typical long-shot case like the one Vringo levied (and ultimately lost) back in 2014. Moreover, the case itself could have significant repercussions for other outfits in the heat of similar arguments about open source software.\n\nGOOGL: Here We Go Again\n\nWarning: You may need to read through the intricacies of this case twice to fully understand what’s going on, and even then, there’s no guarantee it will make complete sense. Here’s the crux of the argument though … Oracle says Alphabet used a little too much of its Java software — which is free, open-source software — in its Android operating system.\n\nThe suit largely hinges on what constitutes “fair use” of open-source and freely-available software.\n\nWhile Oracle offers Java for any consumer to download and any developer to utilize pieces of, the company contends it was never intended for wide swaths of the code to be cut and pasted and utilized as part of a commercial, revenue-bearing system. The complaint specifically read:\n\n“The undisputed evidence showed that Google verbatim copied the heart of Oracle’s creative work for an entirely commercial purpose without any change to Oracle’s expressive content or message, took far more than necessary to program in the Java language, and, in so doing, harmed the market for Java.”\n\nThe strength of Oracle’s copyrights on its application programming interfaces, or APIs, was particularly emphasized by the company in the prior jury trial.\n\nAlphabet’s counterargument is simpler — CEO Larry Page said, “We didn’t pay for the free and open things.”\n\nIf all of this rings a bell with GOOGL stock owners, there’s a reason. This argument has been waged in a courtroom a few times, going back as far as 2010. The current stage for this battle of the titans is an appeal of last year’s loss suffered by Oracle. That case’s loss likely saved Alphabet Inc from being forced to pay the $9 billion in damages Oracle was seeking.\n\nBottom Line for GOOGL Stock, and Others\n\nOwners of GOOGL stock don’t have a great deal to worry about here. The courts sided with the company in the most recent case, and appeals — a reversal of a prior judgment — are very difficult win.\n\nNext Page', ""Alphabet Inc.

This remains true despite a paltry 4% gain for Google stock in 2016. Investors will forgive a company when its return over five years are over 150%, almost twice the gains of the S&P 500.\n\nMany InvestorPlace writers love GOOGL. Chris Katje thinks its Wing Marketplace, a food delivery start-up, could soon stand on its own. Chris Tyler says you should buy Google stock for a breakout to the upside. Craig Adeyanju insists it leads the self-driving space and is well positioned. Ryan Fuhrmann says the boom story is not over.\n\nBut Alphabet is no longer politically favored. CEO Larry Page’s attendance at the Trump “tech summit” continues to anger the company’s allies. Tech companies have reason to fear Trump. GOOGL has $58 billion in cash overseas and the company is not on the President-elect’s Christmas card list.\n\nGOOGL Priced to Perfection\n\nWhen most smart people are predicting great things, it is always wise to consider a bear case. When everyone is in a stock, or any financial instrument, it makes a fall more likely.\n\nRight now, Alphabet is priced to near-perfection — it has a price-to-earnings multiple of 29 — and it is anticipating a steady rise in profits. That looks baked-in for 2016, with $20.77 per share in net income already booked against last year’s $22.84. The balance sheet looks pristine and cash flow is accelerating, reaching over $26 billion just last quarter.\n\nSo far, so good … but Google is changing its alphabet.\n\nThe company’s past is based entirely on cloud software delivering advertising revenues. Google has spent 2016 preparing for a big push into hardware, with a new phone to go against the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone, a voice-activated assistant to go after Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Alexa, a VR headset to go against the Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) Oculus, and a new router that will compete with carrier-delivered gear from Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) and AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ).\n\nThere are two types of risk associated with this move. There is the market risk of going against other big companies. And there is political risk, because every move of the search engine will now be measured against what it means for its growing hardware ecosystem.\n\nThere is reason to believe Alphabet knows this. Google Fiber is being scaled back, and the auto business, now called Waymo, is being slowly transformed from a carmaker to a parts-and-software supplier.\n\nAlphabet Can Lose\n\nGOOGL is already facing political headwinds, especially in Europe, which has filed an antitrust case and is demanding global censorship of the internet resource, including erasing statements from people supportive of the new U.S. Administration.\n\nGoogle was already under pressure on issues of privacy and the so-called “Right to be Forgotten,” designed to make negative statements on people more difficult to trace. Google is still being kept out of China as that country demands the same thing Europe does, obedience to local laws even when they conflict with American norms.\n\nNext Page', 'CEO of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Lawrence Page sold 66,664 shares of GOOG on 12/22/2016 at an average price of $799.9 a share.

But there\'s one other item in the company\'s most recent quarterly report investors may want to take the time to consider: A key change in the way Alphabet will be calculating its non-GAAP results.\n\nStock-based compensation to get the weight it deserves\n\nIn a surprising move, Alphabet explained in its fourth-quarter earnings call that it will no longer exclude stock-based compensation from its non-GAAP results. The change will weigh on non-GAAP earnings per share, but Alphabet believes it will give investors a better view of the company\'s regular operations.\n\nAlphabet CFO Ruth Porat explained the change in the company\'s fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\n[Stock-based compensation] (SBC) has always been an important part of how we reward our employees in a way that aligns their interests with those of all shareholders. Although it\'s not a cash expense, we consider it to be a real cost of running our business because SBC is critical to our ability to attract and retain the best talent in the world. Starting with our first quarter results for 2017, we will no longer regularly exclude stock\xad-based compensation expense from non\xad-GAAP results. Non\xad-cash stock\xad-based compensation will continue to be reported on our cash flow statement, but we will no longer be providing a reconciliation from GAAP to non\xad-GAAP measures that reflects SBC and related tax benefits.\n\nThe change sheds light on the growing cost of Silicon Valley-based talent for tech companies in the Bay Area. Stock-based compensation at companies such as Alphabet and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have grown consistently in recent years, so much so that the two companies have recently announced share repurchase programs seeming to simply aim at offsetting the dilutive impacts of expected stock-based compensation.\n\nTo see what this growing stock-based compensation looks like, consider Alphabet and Facebook\'s stock-based compensation in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.\n\nCompany Q3 2016 Q3 2015 YOY Change Alphabet $1.86 billion $1.4 billion 33% Facebook $2.91 billion $2.86 billion 5%\n\nA precedent for other tech companies\n\nAs one of the biggest tech companies in the world, Alphabet, with the change to its non-GAAP reporting, highlights how regular stock-based compensation has become in Silicon Valley, and it sets a new precedent for other companies to make a similar change.\n\nFacebook could very well be one of the next big tech giants to make a similar move. And if it\'s not planning on making the same change soon, it should. The social network appears to be on the same page as Alphabet when it comes to expecting significant stock-based compensation in the years ahead. Facebook CFO David Wehner said in the company\'s third-quarter conference call that he ""anticipates 2017 will be an aggressive investment year.""\n\nWehner explained: ""Adding top engineering talent remains one of our key investment priorities as we continue to execute on our three-, five- and 10-year roadmap. We will continue to invest in our ability to recruit top technology talent both in the Bay Area and beyond.""\n\nAlmost certainly not a coincidence, Facebook announced a $6 billion repurchase program -- an authorization about equal to what the company will probably spend on share-based compensation in 2017 -- shortly after it said Bay Area hiring would drive an aggressive investment year for the company.\n\nThe bottom line? Bay Area share-based compensation expenses are growing in tandem with tech company revenues, and it\'s time for companies to stop excluding stock-based compensation from non-GAAP results -- starting with Alphabet, and maybe Facebook soon after.', 'Last week, tech giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported its fourth quarter results. The headline results were mixed, with a huge revenue beat coupled with a big earnings miss. While investors and analysts mostly focused on the search business and the future potential of the company\'s ""other bets,"" there was big news that wasn\'t heavily covered. Alphabet announced the following major change to its financial reporting on the conference call that will completely change how we look at the company\'s results.\n\nFirst, we are making changes to our non-GAAP reporting. SBC has always been an important part of how we reward our employees in a way that aligns their interests with those of all shareholders. Although it\'s not a cash expense, we consider it to be a real cost of running our business because SBC is critical to our ability to attract and retain the best talent in the world. Starting with our first quarter results for 2017, we will no longer regularly exclude stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP results. Noncash stock-based compensation will continue to be reported on our cash flow statement, but we will no longer be providing a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures that reflects SBC and related tax benefits.\n\nAnyone that has followed my coverage of Alphabet/Google in the past knows that I\'ve always discussed the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP reporting. With the company excluding stock-based compensation from GAAP, and analysts using non-GAAP for their EPS estimates, the company\'s bottom line looked a lot more impressive than it really was. For instance, just take a look at the following reconciliation table provided in the above-linked earnings release.\n\nAs you can see, non-GAAP net income and earnings per share were more than 23% higher than their GAAP counterparts in Q4. That\'s a significant difference, and that\'s just for one quarter. Over a full year, the Q4 balance annualized would equal more than $7.38 billion in operating income and over $5 billion in net income.\n\nAs someone who is not a fan of non-GAAP numbers, I certainly applaud management for making this change. Investors will have a better idea of how the company is actually doing, because as the statement above said, stock-based compensation is a real cost of running the business. While it is a non-cash expense, it is still an expense that the company incurs.\n\nThis means that analysts and investors will have to change how they look at past results. For instance, the graphic below shows what Yahoo! Finance shows for Alphabet\'s earnings estimates. As you can see, it would appear that 2017 is projected to show no earnings growth. Well, that\'s because the current year is shown in GAAP, while last year\'s figure is non-GAAP, an invalid comparison.\n\n(Source: Yahoo! Finance analyst estimates page)\n\nAlphabet reported GAAP earnings per share of $27.85 in 2016, so the current estimate still represents solid growth. A big difference here is going to be in how the valuation of the company changes. Based on Friday\'s close, the company\'s trailing twelve-month P/E ratio would be roughly 24.9 if we use non-GAAP EPS, but it comes in at over 30.3 if we use GAAP.\n\nThis change will also make the buyback less impactful on earnings per share, although this is a function of simple math. If the company were to reduce its diluted share count by 1%, earnings per share will improve by 1%. When earnings per share are roughly $28 a year, that would be a $0.28 increase. But when they are more than $34 a year, you gain an extra $0.06. For now, this won\'t result in a massive difference, but if Alphabet eventually has an Apple-like (NASDAQ:AAPL) buyback, the difference will be more meaningful.\n\nFor those that love to compare Alphabet to Apple, now we will be able to compare the two on a more appropriate GAAP basis. Apple does not exclude stock-based compensation from its results. Currently, Apple has a trailing twelve-month P/E of 14.7 (yearly EPS will change when the company reports Tuesday), meaning it trades for less than half of what Alphabet does on a GAAP basis. A lot of investors that cited Alphabet\'s non-GAAP P/E when comparing the name to Apple made the situation look a lot different, as I have shown above.\n\nSo while most investors and analysts seemed to focus on the company\'s Q4 results this past week, I\'m more fascinated by the decision to remove stock-based compensation (and its related tax effects) from future reporting. In the end, this will lower Alphabet\'s income and earnings per share figures while also increasing its stated valuation. I\'m curious to see if this impacts how investors view this high growth tech giant, especially its comparisons to Apple.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

The smart watch would be powered by Android wear 2.0. This is one of the two smart watches that the American firm collaborated with a Korean firm.\n\nAccording to techtimes.com, LG Watch Sport might be priced $100 more than the regular stuff though nothing is confirmed as yet. This watch is likely to come with LTE connectivity besides NFC technology. As far as the colors are concerned, the report indicated Rose Gold and Silver.\n\nAlphabet is believed to be interested in unveiling these watches during the Mobile World Congress to be held in Spain later next month. Reports suggested that the watch price is cheaper than what it originally thought it to be. It remains to be whether the customers could still be attracted with the pricing of the two smart watches.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which launched Apple Watch previously, could not hold on to its initial response from the customers. According to IDC, Apple Watch shipments plunged 71.0 percent to 1.1 million units in the third quarter from 3.9 million units in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAlphabet was scheduled to release Android Wear 2 last year. However, the release was delayed for reasons best known to the company. The new smart watches could be the launch pad for the OS.', 'Malware made the leap from PCs to smartphones along with users. It’s always been known that devices running Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android operating system are much more susceptible to being infected than Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhones. However, the situation may be even worse than we realized.\n\nSource: Check Point Software Technologies\n\nA mobile security research team posted on Friday that it scanned devices owned by two large companies and found Android malware pre-installed on smartphones from 38 different manufacturers.\n\nThat discovery should concern both corporate IT departments, and consumers. And it once again validates Apple’s “controlling” iPhone approach.\n\nAndroid Malware Illustrates the Downside of Google’s Approach\n\nFrom the launch of the first iPhone in 2007, Apple retained full control of its iOS operating system and installed it only on its own hardware. Apps can only be downloaded from the App Store and these are checked and vetted by Apple engineers.\n\nWith limited hardware configurations, Apple is able to test iOS thoroughly for all iPhone users. The company is aggressive about pushing out new iOS versions (79% of all iPhones are running iOS 10), and in the event of a security issue, it’s able to quickly push out system updates to address it.\n\nWith Android, GOOGL took a very different approach from Apple. It went wide open, licensing Android to dozens of different smartphone manufacturers. Users are free to tinker with the operating system and they can download apps from virtually anywhere — not just Google Play. This open approach helped Google to dominate the smartphone industry, with nine out of 10 new smartphones running Android.\n\nBut the approach makes smartphone security a nightmare.\n\nAndroid updates often require manufacturer and/or carrier cooperation. As a result, only 2% of Android devices are running the latest version of Android, while the majority are running software that’s at least several years out of date.\n\nFreedom to install questionable apps plus an older version of the operating system has let Android malware run rampant. At one point it was estimated to account for 97% of all mobile malware.\n\nCheck Point’s Pre-Installed Android Malware Discovery\n\nCheck Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: CHKP ), an IT security company, reported in a Friday blog post that it had scanned the smartphones for two large companies (identified only as “large telecommunications company” and a “multinational technology company”) and discovered Android malware had been pre-installed on smartphones from 38 different hardware manufacturers.\n\nAndroid malware identified ranged from adware to mobile ransomware capable of encrypting all data on the device until a fee is paid to unlock it. Some had been added to the smartphone ROM, meaning reinstalling Android would not remove it. And none of this malware was downloaded by users. The smartphones arrived at the two companies pre-infected, with installation happening “somewhere along the supply chain.”\n\nNext Page', 'I love growth stocks as much as the next guy, but Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) might just be my favorite at the moment. That’s because GOOGL stock has something that a lot of other high-growth dynamos simply don’t have:\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAny value left whatsoever.\n\nI’m prudent when it comes to hyper-growth stocks such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ). I’ve missed out on some great runs as a result, but I also haven’t gotten burned when growth flags. Instead, I prefer to focus on “growth at a reasonable price,” or GARP — and I believe GOOGL stock falls into this category.\n\nGo With GARP\n\nWith growth stocks, I look for a price-to-earnings ratio of a stock that is no more than 2x its earnings growth rate, if earnings are growing at 15% annually or more. And I want to back out stock buyback effects. To me, a GARP stock has a PEG ratio of 1.0, though I’ll allow up to 1.5 depending on the earnings growth rate.\n\nGOOGL stock trades at 29x FY16 earnings and about 21x FY17 earnings. Analysts see five-year annualized growth at 19.2%. So on the surface, Alphabet seems to qualify as a GARP pick.\n\nBut there’s even more good news.\n\nThis doesn’t consider the net cash position of GOOGL stock. See, I value a company net of its net cash hoard, just as Peter Lynch used to do. With $86.4 billion on its balance sheet, that pulls the market cap for Alphabet down to about $480 billion.\n\nOn $19.5 billion in net income for FY16, we suddenly find that Alphabet stock trades at 24.6 times FY16 earnings and only about 17.5 times FY17 earnings.\n\nThat’s the first step for me in even determining if GOOGL stock is a stock to get involved in.\n\nHow Is Alphabet’s Business?\n\nThe next thing I examine is how healthy Alphabet Inc’s actual businesses are.\n\nI still don’t like the idea that GOOGL is basically a giant digital advertising billboard with a venture capital arm. However, I can’t deny that Google’s search engine holds an astonishing 80.47% market share. As long as four out of every five searches are conducted on Google, advertisers will throw money at Alphabet. There would have to be a scandal of monumental proportions, or some incredibly innovative new method of searching, to change this significantly.\n\nAlphabet’s 17% year-over-year increase in advertising revenue to $22.4 billion comes as no surprise.\n\nSo next I look at the YOY metrics, which look fantastic Aggregate paid clicks up 36%, paid clicks on Google properties up 43%, and paid clicks on Network properties up 7%. A lot of people freaked out that cost-per-click fell 15%, 16% and 19% for each of the above categories, respectively. The market doesn’t seem to realize that this is because more advertising is being pushed to mobile.\n\nNext Page', 'Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is expected to reveal its financials for the last quarter on 2017-04-20 according to the accessible information.

The denominator in this ratio is earnings. The continued focus on EPS and EPS progression in process of share valuation approach is widely accepted. The point is the EPS obsession to the fact that EPS effortlessly provides the picture of profits generated for shareholders and their opinion appeals to firm’s management and investors alike.\n\nWhen entities, under severe pressure to hit market projections, underachieve EPS forecasts by just a few cents, see ‘double-digit drop’ in stock prices.

Alphabet\'s early forays into self-driving cars, nanotechnologies, and wearables -- among a host of other futuristic endeavors -- have set it apart.\n\nThe notion of IBM as an innovator is more recent, but significant strides in cognitive computing, big data, and cloud analytics has positioned Big Blue on the cutting edge. But the two behemoths are markedly different from an investor\'s perspective. This makes answering the question of which is the better buy an intriguing one.\n\nThe case for Alphabet\n\nAlphabet\'s stock has performed relatively poorly this year, up just 4.5% despite growing at a phenomenal clip, which is particularly impressive given it\'s one of the largest companies on the planet. Meanwhile, IBM isn\'t posting revenue gains quarter in and quarter out, yet its stock has shot up over 21% year to date.\n\nA year ago, Alphabet generated $18.68 billion in total revenue, a 13% improvement over 2014\'s third quarter. And that paled in comparison to 2016\'s third quarter, in which revenue climbed 20% year over year, to $22.45 billion. The fact Alphabet is gaining sales momentum at its size is largely due to its focus on mobile search and video, a recognized area of weakness a year ago.\n\nThanks in part to improving margins, earnings per share soared 27% last quarter despite Alphabet\'s infamous spending: Both cost of revenue and operating expense increased. However, Alphabet\'s other revenues skyrocketed 39% in the third quarter, and its ""Other Bets"" losses narrowed. Alphabet\'s spending is beginning to pay off, which bodes extremely well for continuing its stellar run.\n\nThe case for IBM\n\nInvestors and pundits seem to realize that for IBM, total revenue takes a backseat to its ""strategic imperatives"" results -- which explains why IBM shareholders are enjoying a banner year. Last quarter\'s $19.2 billion in sales was flat compared to a year ago, when the company posted a solid result compared with the revenue declines of the past.\n\nIBM\'s strategic imperatives -- which include data security and mobile sales, in addition to the aforementioned cloud, analytics, and cognitive computing -- generated $8 billion in the quarter, up 16% compared to a year ago. CEO Ginni Rometty\'s focus on the sales of cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) and business process solutions is driving IBM\'s strong results.\n\nThis year cloud-related SaaS and business process revenue is expected to generate over $80 billion, which explains IBM\'s phenomenal annual run-rate increase of 66% in the third quarter in what it calls cloud as a service. The annual run rate of $7.5 billion in cloud service sales last quarter was nearly a third of IBM\'s total strategic imperatives revenue of $31.8 billion.\n\nSurprisingly, IBM actually enjoyed a slight decrease in total expense and other income in the third quarter. The spending decline was surprising in that IBM has invested literally billions of dollars in its strategic imperatives this year alone. And then there\'s the appeal of IBM\'s 3.4% dividend yield to investors in search of income. By contrast, Alphabet steadfastly refuses to pay a dividend, though it is giving back to shareholders via its recently announced $7 billion stock repurchase plan.\n\nWhich is the better buy?\n\nAlphabet should continue to report quarterly sales and earnings that are simply off the charts, but it\'s become a victim of its own success. When 20% revenue growth and 27% per-share earnings gains warrant little more than a yawn from investors, it calls into question how much upside Alphabet really offers. That said, its stock should slowly but surely climb over the years, just not as much as it has earned based on its financials.\n\nIBM stock isn\'t likely to skyrocket any time soon, either. But what IBM stock should do is continue its steady climb, translating to more upside than Alphabet over the long haul -- because of the company\'s strategic imperatives success, and because it had underperformed for so long. Add in a solid dividend and the nod goes to IBM.', 'One could never confuse International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) with Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) or even Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) for that matter. However, those looking for income in 2017 should put aside all the negativity that has followed IBM stock in recent years and add it to your portfolio.\n\nHere’s why.\n\nThe key to any good dividend stock is consistently growing dividends. IBM has increased dividends for 21 consecutive years; in the last five years, International Business Machines has averaged annual dividend growth of 13.4%, a positive sign for anyone looking for yields of 3% or higher.\n\nIBM stock currently yields a healthy 3.3% despite its stock being up 21% year-to-date through Dec. 27.\n\nIt’s especially positive given how much free cash flow the company has been allocating toward share repurchases in recent years. Since 2012, it has reduced its share count by 16.5% to 964 million shares. During those three years, it repurchased $32.2 billion of its stock and paid out another $13 billion in dividends representing 112.4% of its cumulative free cash flow.\n\nIt’s no secret, then, why International Business Machines’ revenues shrunk from $102.9 billion in 2012 to $81.7 billion in 2015 and non-GAAP operating earnings declined by 18% over the same period — a lack of investment in research and development and no meaningful acquisitions to speak of has literally been choking the life out of IBM.\n\nHowever, all that appears to have changed in 2015, providing dividend investors with a renewed interest in IBM stock.\n\nWhat’s Going on With IBM Stock?\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, International Business Machines paid out $18 billion for share repurchases and dividends; in 2015, that dropped to $9.5 billion and so far, through the first three-quarters of 2016, it has shelled out just $6.5 billion, which means the company will have more available to pay down some of its $35.6 billion in long-term debt while still increasing the amount it invests in R&D.\n\nAt the height of its free cash flow in 2012, IBM was generating $18.2 billion, paying out 86% of it to shareholders. In 2016, if International Business Machines generates $15 billion in free cash flow and allocates no more than $9 billion to shareholders, it will have paid out just 60% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends and share repurchases, leaving a substantial amount to reinvest in its business.\n\nIBM has been on a journey over the last decade and it still has a lot of work left to regain a prominent place in technology. That said, it has made progress.\n\nIn 2005, its gross margin was 40%; today, it’s 11 percentage points higher. A big driver of that is its software and services business, which includes the cloud. While its overall revenues are falling, International Business Machines’ revenue from strategic imperatives established in 2014 such as big data, analytics, cloud, mobile, social and security are rising.\n\nIn 2015, revenue from its strategic imperatives increased by 26% excluding currency to $28.9 billion or 35% of its overall revenue. Its cloud revenue increased 57% in 2015 to $10.2 billion. In Q3 2016, its strategic imperatives generated $8 billion in revenue representing 40% of its total for the quarter.\n\nNext Page', 'Saying that you\'re going to buy a stock and never sell it seems a bit audacious.

And perhaps more important, according to NetMarketShare, it commands 93.8% of the mobile search market share globally.\n\n2. It boasts six other products with over 1 billion users\n\nBut as you\'re probably well aware, Google is much more than just search. It has six other applications with over 1 billion users. These include Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, Chrome, Android, and Google Play Store.\n\n3. That all adds up to a lot of data\n\n""Sure,"" you might say, ""but the company doesn\'t charge for most of those products. That\'s not great business.""\n\nWhile you\'d be right, you\'d be missing out on what\'s dubbed the ""oil of the information age"": data. With every user in all seven of those aforementioned apps, the company is able to collect gobs of data. In fact, I don\'t think it would be too hard to argue that Google has more data on the people walking this earth than any other organization, at any other time in human history.\n\n4. At its heart, it is still an advertising company\n\nThat data is worth billions to advertisers. In the old days, companies would try to target their audience by putting ads in magazines or newspapers where potential customers might be lurking. But the feedback loop wasn\'t great: Advertisers never knew just how effective that ad spending was.\n\nNot so anymore. With Google\'s advertising platform, companies get real-time feedback on how efficiently their ads are being placed, and how much business they produce. Given the data hoard that the company has, ads placed through Google can be more targeted to the perfect customer than any other available source. That\'s a huge moat for the company.\n\nIt also helps explain why Google advertising brought in $67 billion in sales last year for the company, or 90% of all revenue.\n\n5. Digital ads are poised to grow\n\nIf you think you\'ve missed the boat, rest assured you haven\'t. A March 2016 report from eMarketer shows that there\'s still a lot of room for internet advertising to grow.\n\nAnd with TV still retaining one-third of the global market share in 2019, I can only imagine that the runway for internet ad growth will continue for much of the next decade.\n\n6. The company is more than a one-trick pony\n\nBack to that name change, from ""Google"" to ""Alphabet."" You might better understand the reasoning if you look at the new corporate name as ""Alpha-Bet."" This rendering of the name reflects the company\'s practice of taking a lot of moonshot bets on revolutionary technologies outside its main search and data-capturing business.\n\nThis is what famed trader, academic, and thinker Nassim Taleb would call a barbell approach: having a large a reliable stream of revenue on one side while taking lots of small bets on the other. While the likelihood of any one moonshot succeeding is small, all it will take is one or two winners over the next decade to make a meaningful difference for shareholders.\n\nWhat are these moonshots? We probably don\'t know all of them, but the ones we do include self-driving cars, a connected home, a life sciences company, and lightning-fast internet connection.\n\n7. Its mission statement is memorable\n\nI\'m a sucker for a good mission statement. When it is clear and powerful, it can be the compass that helps guide management and employees alike toward a common goal.\n\nGoogle\'s mission statement is: ""To organize the world\'s information and make it universally accessible and useful.""\n\nThe mission of new-formed parent company Alphabet is multifaceted but can be broken down to: ""Getting more ambitious things done[,] ... empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish ... [and] as a result of all this, improving the lives of as many people as we can.""\n\nThose are both powerful and flexible enough objectives to keep the company relevant in a quickly changing world.\n\n8. It has soul in the game\n\nLest you think that you might have a few executives who are in this for short-term gain, Alphabet is still run by its co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Together, they -- along with all of the other company executives and board members -- own almost 48 million shares of Alphabet, and account for 60% of the company\'s voting power. To put the number of shares in perspective, it is equivalent to almost $40 billion at today\'s prices.\n\n9. The proof is in the culture\n\nAnother metric that\'s often overlooked is a company\'s culture. If Page and Brin really do want to accomplish the ambitious goals they\'ve laid out, they need a stable and motivated workforce to get things done.\n\nTo get an idea for the company\'s approach, a 2010 filing with the SEC stated that ""[monetary] incentives are secondary to career growth, work environment, and engaging work opportunities. We seek to develop a highly motivated and collaborative workforce that pursues achievements for the sake of progress and innovation before individual gain.""\n\nBased on employee reviews on Glassdoor.com, I\'d say the company is doing pretty well.\n\n10. There is lots of cash to make it work\n\nFinally, if you\'ve got a company that\'s going to be taking lots of small bets that can be costly, it\'s good to know that management is sitting on a pretty expansive war chest. And that\'s what you get with Alphabet.\n\nLong-term debt: $3.9 billion\n\nCash, short-, and long-term investments: $88.8 billion\n\nThis, and the other nine reasons above, helps me sleep well at night knowing my family is invested in -- and likely won\'t sell for a long time -- such a company.', 'Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is a stock that’s boring, until it’s not. In 2012, GOOG stock went up by single digits but then in 2013 it gained almost 60%. Then in 2014, what was then Google stock lost about 3% before gaining another 44% again in 2015 after changing its name to Alphabet along the way.\n\nIn 2016, Alphabet Inc. was up by about 8% to lag the overall stock market. So will the past trend hold, and will 2017 be a breakout year?\n\nThere are fair arguments on both sides. After all, the high-growth days of Google are behind it after the internet giant has matured to a nearly $600 billion company. Also, rival Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) is now its peer in both its reach and its relationship with digital advertisers. On the other hand, bulls who like GOOG stock or GOOGL like its track record of consistent growth and innovation over the years.\n\nSo who’s right? Here’s a look at both sides of the trade with three pros and three cons to investing in Alphabet stock right now.\n\nPros of GOOG Stock\n\nGrowth: While the company restructured into Alphabet in 2015, Google advertising remains the biggest part of its business. And that business is good, judging by overall revenue growth of 19% this year and a projected 16% growth rate next year. Furthermore, profits will be up 16% this year and 19% next year. With continued success from its core, Alphabet can afford to look into new efforts without worrying about financial performance.\n\nValuation: Despite a strong history of success and projections of future growth, GOOG stock is not overvalued. Right now, shares trade for around 20 times forward earnings. That is on par with forward P/E of about 19 for the typical stock in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. If you can get a fair price for a high-growth company like this, you should take it.\n\nInnovation: With a fair current price and hopes of future growth, there’s a lot to like about Alphabet Inc. right now. But with constant innovation into new areas, including a “smart” contact lens that can read your blood sugar or Google Fiber high-speed internet access, there is a whole lot of future potential from GOOG stock.\n\nTo keep reading and get 3 reasons to steer clear of Alphabet stock, click here or use the navigation below.', ""JPMorgan Chase & Co. reduced its position in Alphabet Inc.

The Verge has details on how the new feature works:\n\nYou tap the attach button like you normally would to send along a photo, video, or document, and now you’ll see an option to attach some money. Recipients don’t need a Gmail email address for it to work, and they can have money transferred directly to their bank account once it’s been received.\n\nSending money through Google Wallet is free for both the sender and the recipient, which gives it a leg up on some other popular services. Currently, the P2P money sending market is dominated by Paypal and Venmo, but major U.S. banks are teaming up to try and take their share of the market via a new service called Zelle.\n\nWhile the new Gmail feature is unlikely to be a huge catalyst for Google Wallet, it’s at least a sign that Google wants to keep Wallet around for a while. Perhaps more development will follow, and Wallet — which Google doesn’t share any metrics about — can grow into a major revenue generator for the company somehow in a very fast-growing market.\n\nAlphabet Inc shares were trading at $864.76 per share on Tuesday afternoon, up $0.18 (+0.02%).

In the markets, there is an elite group of companies that define their respective industries. For example, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) owns e-commerce, while Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) has forever changed social media. And for now, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is the king of smart devices. But in my humble opinion, GOOGL stock tops them all.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDon’t get me wrong as this is not a slight against any of the above companies. Just let me forward a very basic observation — all these other names essentially require the internet to function. If not directly, then certainly, access to the internet represents their core marketing message.\n\nBut what happens when you own the internet? That’s a theoretical question to everyone except GOOGL.\n\nAs I mentioned in a prior contribution, the dominance of the GOOGL search engine is unparalleled. The margin between Alphabet Inc and the next biggest competitor, Bing, is a whopping 300%. It just gets worse as you go down the rankings. By the time you hit fifth place, it’s just not even worth considering. In any other industry, such a statement would be the death knell for the competition.\n\nEssentially, GOOGL stock is an investment in life itself. Many people thought that the name change to Alphabet — a play on the financial term “alpha” and the gambling term “bet” — was cheeky and a bit ridiculous. But it also signified that Alphabet Inc could do whatever it wants because no one can stop it. GOOGL stock was essentially either an asset or a threat, depending on your perspective.\n\nVolatility Is a Risk to GOOGL Stock\n\nUnfortunately, where it matters most for investors, GOOGL stock hasn’t always shown its best stuff. True, it’s early into 2017, and so far, it’s up over 4% year-to-date. Keep that up every month and you’re guaranteed a stellar annual return. But Alphabet Inc has also been inconsistent, as InvestorPlace contributor Chris Tyler points out. For example, GOOGL was looking at closing January at over 6%. Instead, it only secured 1.4%.\n\nOn a strictly nominal basis, that’s not much of a swing. But on percentage basis, it’s a much different story. It has been well over a decade since Alphabet stock introduced itself to the markets. The crazy dynamics involved in a fresh tech company should be over by now. Today, GOOGL and its subsidiaries are comparable to General Electric Company (NYSE: GE ) if GE was a little more hip.\n\nBut with great size comes great envy. Alphabet Inc now faces a fundamental problem. Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL ) wants to reengage a court ruling that went in favor of GOOGL. At issue is the company’s generous use of Oracle’s Java software in order to design the Android operating system. GOOGL contends that using Java — which is open-source — is fair game. Oracle contends that it violates the “fair use ” component of copyright law.\n\nFor those that acquired GOOGL stock, it’s an ugly situation that might be a legitimate risk. Here’s the thing — whether it’s legitimate or not doesn’t matter. If the markets think it’s a problem, it’s a problem. That makes the sighting of what appears to be a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern (between early December until now) a curious development.\n\nNext Page', ""Smith Salley & Associates increased its position in Alphabet Inc.

Starting today, the tech company\'s self-driving car efforts have graduated from the Google X research unit, as one of Alphabet\'s ""moonshots,"" to an official Alphabet business called Waymo.\n\n""Waymo stands for a new way forward in mobility. We\'re a self-driving technology company with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to move around,"" Waymo said in a blog post on Tuesday.\n\nAlphabet\'s launch of Waymo comes nearly eight years after the company began working on self-driving cars, but it enters what is quickly turning into a fiercely competitive market as Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) asserts it is already including self-driving sensors in every vehicle and as other auto manufacturers, tech companies, and ride-hailing services explore ways to monetize the nascent technology.\n\nMeet Waymo\n\nWaymo was careful to emphasize that this is not the beginning of Alphabet\'s efforts in this important space, but rather the culmination of years of work.\n\n""Waymo may be a new company, but we\'re building on advanced self-driving technology developed over many years at Google,"" said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in the company\'s blog post.\n\nAlphabet knew it was time for Waymo to begin the process of becoming its own company when the former Google X project completed ""the world\'s first fully self driven car ride"" in late 2015, Krafcik said. Navigating through Austin\'s suburbs with legally blind passenger Steve Mahan, Alphabet says the drive reflected everyday driving situations.\n\nMahan explained the importance of this milestone:\n\nThe ability to complete a fully self-driven trip on everyday public roads, with no test driver, was a big milestone for our team and the history of this technology. It was the signal that we could begin to shift our focus from foundational technical work toward launching our own company so we can offer many more rides, in more places, for more people.\n\nSelf-driving technology -- not self-driving cars\n\nInterestingly, in conjunction with the announcement of Waymo today, Alphabet is reportedly backing off any plans to manufacture and sell its own self-driving cars, opting instead to partner with auto manufacturers in order to deploy the technology, according to The Information\'s Amir Efrati.\n\nAlphabet has backed off plans to develop a revolutionary car without a steering wheel or pedals, at least for now, according to people close to the closely watched project. Instead, the self-driving car pioneer has settled on a more practical effort to partner with automakers to make a vehicle that drives itself but has traditional features for human drivers.\n\nAnd a comment from Waymo\'s Krafcik during a press conference on Tuesday seems to confirm the new company\'s choice to abstain from auto manufacturing for now. ""We\'ve been really clear that we\'re not a car company,"" Krafcik said (via The New York Times). ""We\'re not in the business of making better cars. We\'re in the business of making better drivers.""\n\nAlphabet\'s decision to refrain from manufacturing its own self-driving vehicles differs from Tesla\'s emphasis on both the self-driving technology and the manufacturing of self-driving vehicles and it means Tesla doesn\'t have to worry about the technology giant becoming a direct competitor -- for now. However, it\'s worth noting it was never certain Alphabet ever intended on manufacturing its own vehicles in the first place.\n\nGiven how competitive and capital intensive the auto market is, focusing solely on the self-driving technology may arguably be the better move for software-centric Alphabet\'s Waymo. Indeed, Waymo isn\'t the only major company to acknowledge the challenge ambitious manufacturing plans could bring about. By focusing on the autonomous driving software instead of building self-driving cars, Alphabet\'s Waymo vision mimics a recent report that Apple has also shifted its focus from building its own self-driving car to emphasizing the development of the underlying technology for autonomous driving.', 'InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs Waymo becomes part of the Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) family of companies, most analysts are asking when or whether it will contribute to GOOG stock\'s bottom line.\n\nSource: Brionv via Wikimedia (Modified)\n\nThe launch event on Dec. 13 featured a blind man given a ride around Austin, Texas in a car without a steering wheel, and vague discussion of how the project\'s 2 million miles of self-driving experience could be put to work in ride sharing, trucking or public transport.\n\nWhile previous GOOG projects like Nest, the automated home company, and Google Fiber, the phone company competitor, quickly floundered as their teams tried to change the world, the car company Waymo seems interested in getting paid for helping others change the world.\n\nIt\'s an important distinction. Google X, the unit into which CFO Ruth Porat put CEO Larry Page\'s ""moonshots"" in technology unrelated to the search engine, is now expected to turn into a real company or go away.\n\nA Real Market for GOOG\n\nThe new Waymo is being run by a car guy, former Hyundai USA President John Krafcik, leaving the experimental team under Chris Urmson by the side of the road. Urmson is launching his own startup.\n\nKrafcik is building a team of experienced auto executives, and representing the company in the press, dealing with the fallout from a Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) driver dying with the car in a self-driving mode, the opening of a Waymo design office in Detroit and initial questions of government regulation.\n\nThese are practical questions previous Alphabet launches tended to ignore. They also tended to ignore whether the opportunity before them was real or in their heads.\n\nIn the case of Waymo, it\'s clear there is a real market. Boston Consulting Group estimates it at $42 billion in software and services within 10 years, others say $560 billion in sales within 20 .\n\nThis has attracted real competition, not just from Tesla but from Uber, General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) and start-ups like nuTonomy .\n\nThe question for Krafcik is not whether Waymo can knock off these other companies, but where Waymo\'s experience, software and hardware packages can fit into their plans.\n\nDeliberately Undefined\n\nKrafcik is leaving that deliberately undefined. The company has sold Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE: FCAU ) on a package that will make 100 of its minivans self-driving members of the Waymo fleet.\n\nBut there are other assets Krafcik can capitalize on, and technical hurdles to be overcome along the way. The lidar ""bucket"" on top of current Google cars costs too much, for instance. The problems of scaling the solution are real ones. Getting the public, politicians and the insurance industry to accept self-driving as a concept is going to be a huge job for the company.\n\nWaymo needs to bring in enough cash from what it has already done to fund research into these more specialized areas.\n\nFor now, Krafcik plans to make Waymo an enabling technology, leaving the heavy capital lifting to others, and making his own efforts self-sustaining.\n\nThe Bottom Line on GOOG Stock\n\nThis modest approach will free corporate assets to keep investing in software, in cloud data centers, and in device hardware, which is where CFO Ruth Porat wants the company to be.\n\nIt should also satisfy shareholders. If Waymo can break even going forward, it will leave GOOG stock\'s 29.3 price-to-earnings multiple and $554 billion in market cap alone.\n\nSince Porat became CFO for what is now Alphabet in June, 2015, GOOG stock is up 49%, the bottom line growing 20% while the top line has grown 10%; it has kept its operating margins at about 25%, and the company will announce revenues of well over $80 billion for the year when it reports 2016 on Jan. 26.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

And it would be tough to argue with her. In 2016, Google parent Alphabet\'s revenue and profits increased, its core advertising business, non-advertising initiatives gained significant traction, and it wrapped up the year with two very successful Google-branded hardware launches. Here are eight facts to help capture Alphabet\'s business in 2016.\n\nTotal revenue increased 20% -- a notable acceleration from 14% year-over-year growth in 2015. And growth even picked up throughout 2016, with the company reporting 22% year-over-year growth in its fourth quarter, or 24% on a constant currency basis.\n\nAlphabet cited mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising as key revenue drivers during the year.\n\nOther bets revenue soared 82%, driven primarily by its smart home Nest products, Google Fiber internet, and Google\'s life science organization, Verily.\n\nStill, other bets remain unprofitable. Indeed, the segment, which only represents about 1% of Alphabet\'s total revenue, lost $2.9 billion in 2016 when excluding stock-based compensation -- and this loss was on just $809 million in revenue. Including stock-based compensation, other bets operating loss was a whopping $3.6 billion.\n\nAlphabet spent $3.7 billion repurchasing its own shares. As part of Alphabet\'s $7 billion repurchase program, the company\'s share repurchases in 2016 climbed higher. But investors shouldn\'t expect the share repurchase program to meaningfully reduce the company\'s shares outstanding, as Alphabet\'s stock-based award activities are almost just as aggressive. In 2016, Alphabet paid $3.3 billion in stock-based compensation.\n\nOther revenue increased 41%. Not to be confused with Alphabet\'s much smaller other bets segment, the company\'s other revenue, which is made up of non-advertising Google products, was driven primarily by Alphabet\'s Google Play app store, hardware sales, and cloud businesses.\n\nAlphabet introduced Waymo. Buried in Alphabet\'s other bets business, Alphabet\'s self-driving car technology development became a stand-alone business called Waymo.\n\n""Waymo may be a new company, but we\'re building on advanced self-driving technology developed over many years at Google,"" said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in a December blog post. Alphabet intends for Waymo to commercialize self-driving vehicle hardware and software, aiming to dramatically improve road safety.\n\nIn October, Alphabet launched a smart speaker and a smartphone. The company\'s voice-activated Google Home speaker and its new Google Pixel phone were clear successes this holiday season. While the company doesn\'t provide specific sales figures on the device, management did say it was ""thrilled with the reception"" for these devices, and that their success looks promising.\n\nAlphabet made significant progress in its cloud business. Management said in the company\'s fourth-quarter earnings call that its cloud business is on a ""terrific upswing."" With the help of Alphabet\'s well-timed $625 million acquisition of API provider Apigee, Alphabet made particular progress differentiating its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by sharpening its offerings in data analytics, machine learning, security, and tools for application development. Further, in 2016, Alphabet\'s Google Cloud\'s G Suite product, which offers cloud-based collaboration and productivity applications, garnered more than three million paying customers by the end of the year.\n\nGoing into 2017, Alphabet will be up against a strong benchmark: itself. With a tough year-over-year comparison of 20% revenue growth in 2016, the company will need to continue executing well across Google advertising and YouTube, as well as its smaller businesses like hardware and cloud. Further, while Alphabet\'s other bets are still too small to help overall revenue growth in 2017, investors should continue to look for promising signs from the segment this year.', 'Analyst Ratings For Alphabet Inc.

Rather, you’ll have to buy SNAP in the after-market, when the valuation will probably be much higher.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSo is it any wonder that IPOs can be a raw deal?\n\nThat may be true, but when it comes to investing in the big-growth opportunities, there really is no need to speculate in the IPO market. Hey, there are a variety of interesting stocks currently on the market that should be good enough.\n\nTake a Look at GOOGL Stock\n\nOne to consider is actually Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ). Granted, the company is fairly mature, having been founded in 1998.\n\nBut what’s important about GOOGL stock is that the company has global brand, scale, infrastructure and massive user base to play in critical growth markets. Such factors are must-haves for getting the attention of sponsors, especially those that have massive budgets.\n\nThis is why a company like Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) has struggled so much. In fact, in the latest quarter, the company’s revenues increased by a mere 0.9% on a year-over-year basis to $717.2 million, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of top-line deceleration. U.S. revenues fell by 4% to $440 million and of course, the company has yet to generate a profit on a GAAP basis.\n\nAll this happened even though there were major catalysts from the presidential election, NFL streaming and the holiday season.\n\nBy comparison, in the latest quarter Alphabet reported an impressive 22% jump in revenues to $26.1 billion and GAAP earnings of $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per share on GOOGL stock.\n\nBut this shouldn’t be much of a surprise. The fact is that GOOGL is positioned nicely for major growth categories like video (YouTube), mobile (Android, Google Play and Waze), devices (Pixel and Google Home) and cloud computing. All these represent multi-billion-dollar market opportunities — and should all provide nice long-term drivers for GOOGL stock.\n\nJust look at Waze, which Alphabet Inc purchased for $1.3 billion back in October 2013. Interestingly enough, this price tag may have been a bargain! Note that GOOGL plans to launch a ride-hailing service — similar to Uber’s — in various cities in the U.S. that is based on the Waze platform.\n\nBy the way, back in 2013, the company also invested $258 million in Uber.\n\nNext Page', ""Micawber Capital LLC bought a new stake in shares of Alphabet Inc.

Alphabet's board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to about $7 billion of its Class C stock. While the repurchase program is probably a good idea, is it big enough to really make a difference?\n\nWell timed, but too small\n\nAlphabet's third-quarter announced repurchase program isn't its first. It follows a $5.1 billion repurchase program initiated in the third quarter of 2015. Interestingly, a review of how this program fared can provide some useful insights for the new program.\n\nThe first thing to note about Alphabet's $5.1 repurchase program is that it was well-timed. Share repurchases have the biggest positive impact when they are executed at a lower stock price than where shares end up later on. Fortunately, Alphabet was able to purchase its shares at a discount with its $5.1 program. The stock is up about 20% since Alphabet started repurchasing shares. Further, since about half of this gain came after Alphabet had already exhausted its authorized $5.1 billion repurchases, the timing of the program was particularly keen.\n\nBut because $5.1 billion is hardly a large sum given Alphabet's $521 billion market capitalization, and adding in the fact that Alphabet was averaging over a billion dollars every quarter on stock-based compensation, the net effect of these repurchases were more preventative than accretive when it came to reducing total share count.\n\nIndeed, Alphabet's Class C share count is actually higher in 2016 compared to 2015, despite the $5.1 billion repurchase program.\n\nThis isn't to say Alphabet's repurchase program isn't making a difference. Without these repurchases, Alphabet's share count would be even higher today. Further, since the repurchases were well timed, Alphabet essentially got more bang for its buck than it was actually spending. But this $5.1 billion repurchase program does show that Alphabet is going to need a much bigger authorization if the repurchases are going to have a meaningfully accretive impact on earnings per share.\n\nStill not big enough\n\nWhile Alphabet's new repurchase program is larger, it arguably doesn't represent the jump investors should be hoping for. Like its $5.1 billion program, the $7 billion program will likely also fail to reduce Alphabet's total share count, and it may even fail to fully take advantage of an opportunistic period.\n\nIn Alphabet's third quarter alone, the company diluted shareholder ownership with $1.63 billion in stock-based compensation, up significantly from about $1.28 billion of stock-based compensation in the year-ago quarter. Assuming stock-based compensation continues to grow alongside Alphabet's expected revenue and net income growth throughout 2017, its stock-based compensation during the first twelve months of this program is likely to match or even exceed the $7 billion authorized for repurchases.\n\nAnd looking beyond the simple fact that Alphabet's share repurchase program isn't likely big enough to help reduce its share count, it's also arguable that Alphabet is simply hanging on to too much cash. In its most recent quarter, Alphabet's cash and cash equivalents hit $83 billion, up 14% from its $72.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Further, the search giant is generating significant free cash flow, or cash from operations less capital expenditures, every quarter. In its third quarter alone, Alphabet raked in $7.3 billion in free cash flow.\n\nThe big question mark with Alphabet's new $7 billion repurchase program -- or any repurchase program for that matter -- is whether the timing of purchases will be right. While I'd personally argue that Alphabet's shares are still undervalued, a sell-off in the overall stock market, a recession, or unexpected competitive headwinds, could drive the stock lower and render Alphabet's conservative repurchases today great decisions in hindsight.\n\nBut considering Alphabet's incredible lead in online search, paired with the company's heady cash flow, I'd bet investors would benefit more from an even larger repurchase program.\n\nMaybe Alphabet's decision to repurchase $7 billion this time around instead of $5.1 billion is the beginning of a trend that could turn into more aggressive repurchases down the road. But will Alphabet have missed a great opportunity by then?"", 'As per usual, all eyes will be on the company formerly known as Google, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL , as the tech giant prepares to release its fourth-quarter earnings report on Thursday. The company rolled out its new Google Pixel phone and ushered in a new era of hardware-software interaction during the quarter, making this week\'s announcement even more important than usual.\n\nIn fact, the Google Pixel will most likely be the most compelling aspect of Alphabet\'s latest report, and investors will be clamoring to know how the device sold. It will also be interesting to see what the company says about its Google Home Controller, which also launched in the U.S. this quarter.\n\nThe Google Pixel is important because it is Alphabet\'s first high-end smartphone entirely produced in-house and represents a significant challenge to Apple\'s AAPL iPhone line. The Google Home tells another story of competition; the ""Internet of Things"" in-home hub is one of the only competitors to Amazon\'s AMZN Echo speaker.\n\nMore importantly, both of these products underscore Alphabet\'s efforts to usher in its intelligent personal assistant software, Google Assistant. With similar functions to Apple\'s Siri and Microsoft\'s MSFT Cortana, Google Assistant is the backbone of the Pixel and Home devices and promises to be the foundation for all of Google\'s original products heading forward.\n\nAlso, investors should not forget about the other products that Google launched in the quarter, all of which were officially unveiled at the same event in October. The company debuted its stylish headset for the Daydream VR platform, the ""Daydream View,"" as well as its first router, ""Google Wifi,"" and a Chromecast update, ""Chromecast Ultra.""\n\nAll of these products are important pieces of Google\'s effort to create a complete line of products that work together and with the new Google Assistant software. This is just the first quarter of sales, but it is also the holiday quarter and should give us a good idea of whether or not these products are resonating with shoppers.\n\nHeading into the report, Alphabet Inc. has seen one positive estimate revision over the past week. Our current consensus estimates indicate EPS growth of 8.40% and sales growth of 18.75%, and this has helped earn the company an ""A"" grade for growth. This is especially noteworthy given the relative size and status of Alphabet already. Overall, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and that\'s always a good sign heading into an earnings announcement.\n\nNevertheless, Alphabet currently has an Earnings ESP of -0.26%, which makes surprise prediction a bit more difficult.\n\nZacks\' Top 10 Stocks for 2017\n\nIn addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?\n\nWho wouldn\'t?

This includes a win in November after I explained how to collect free dividends on GOOGL stock as we collected over 15% in yield on money risked.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge Alphabet’s fundamentals have not changed. I still like it for the long-term. Management continues to execute very well on the cash cow businesses. Better still: Spending on the fringe projects seems to be under control for now.\n\nTechnically, GOOGL stock was tested in late 2016 but has since recovered. Traders sold Alphabet stock and others mega-tech companies like Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) to roll into the Trump trade. Since then, the selling abated and the trade unwound.\n\nNow, mega-tech companies are going into earnings with the winds in their sails. That includes Alphabet, which reports on Thursday, Jan. 26, after the bell.\n\nHow to Trade GOOGL Stock Now\n\nThe Trade: Buy the GOOGL Feb $835/$837.50 debit call spread for $1.20 per contract to open. This is my maximum potential risk. I stand to double my money if GOOGL stock rallies past my spread in the next few weeks.\n\nPremiums are usually elevated ahead of earnings, and sometimes we see a move ahead of the report. If so, then I could close the spread and book partial profits early.\n\nUsually I like to balance my trades by doing the opposite. But this time, since we are going into earnings, I will not sell any bearish risk into GOOGL earnings. Another hedge idea would be to short the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQ ). But today, I will do neither. Instead, I will simply go long Alphabet Inc options as a lottery ticket betting on a positive reaction to their earnings.\n\nI could further juice this trade by adding a credit put spread to collect premium and offset my out of pocket expense. However, this adds more downside risk. Personally, I prefer to wait until after the earnings report before I sell premium into GOOGL.\n\nStill, if you’d like …\n\nThe Juice (Optional): Sell the GOOGL Mar $750/$745 credit put spread for 65 cents per contract. This trade would yield 13% if GOOGL stays above my sold spread while I am holding. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success with a 10% price buffer.\n\nEarnings events add a short-term wild card to credit spreads; the short-term adverse reactions are often short-lived.\n\nI am not required to hold any option trade open through expiration. I can close any of them at any time for partial gains or losses.\n\nNicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

That represents a 10-fold increase since 2012, according to YouTube, when it started building algorithms that analyse user data to give each user personalized video lineups designed to keep them watching longer. Believe it or not, 400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube each minute, or 65 years of video a day. YouTube benefits from the enormous reach of Google, which handles over 93% of internet searches. Google embeds YouTube videos in search results and pre-installs the YouTube app on its Android software, which is running on over 88% of smartphones.\n\nSurprisingly, since Google parent Alphabet Inc doesn’t break out YouTube’s performance, it is still unclear if YouTube is profitable. Some analysts estimate it took in about $US4 billion in ad revenue in 2014 (YouTube makes most of its money on running ads before videos) and roughly broke even. However, given the subscriber growth since then and assuming Google hasn’t overspent on technology and rights to content, YouTube should underpin the company’s growth going forward. About 2 billion unique users now watch a YouTube video every 90 days, according to industry specialists.\n\nAlphabet is in Macrovue’s Tech Stars Vue and Social Media Vue.\n\nAnother Week – More Record Highs\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 21,000 mark for the first time, gaining 183.95, or 0.9%, to close the week at 21,005.71—its fourth straight weekly gain. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 0.7%, to 2383.12, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4%, to 5870.75; both have been up for six straight weeks. A more conciliatory and “presidential” speech from Mr. Trump and generally positive economic data from around the globe were the main drivers of last week’s market rally.\n\nSnap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) IPO\n\nSnap Inc shares surged on their first day of trading Thursday as investors clamoured for shares of the biggest technology initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S. since Alibaba Group (BABA:NYSE) made its debut in 2014. Shares of Snap opened at $24, above the IPO price of $17, and recently traded up to US$27.09 on Friday. That’s a 59% gain over the offer price.\n\nThe investment case for Snap rests on its vast audience of 158 million daily users (DAUs) in the fourth quarter, concentrated in the coveted 18-to-34-year-old demographic. Snapchat has also won millions of teen users. Certainly the site has attracted advertisers who want to reach that younger audience.\n\nFundamentally, Snap comes to market with a few “warts”. The company lost more than $500 million as it spent heavily on data storage and marketing and research. Snap must quickly monetize its advertising business in order to support its rich valuation and approach its near term target of $1 billion in revenue. In 2016, the company posted revenue of $404.5 million, up nearly sevenfold compared to 2015-revenue. Not surprisingly, the Wall Street analysts who follow the company have an average target price of US$16.50 or slightly less than the issue price!\n\nThe Week Ahead\n\nChina Numbers\n\nThe Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and National People’s Congress (NPC) meetings will wrap up. Analysts expect the 2017 GDP goal unchanged at +6.5-7%. The fiscal deficit target will likely be raised from 3% in 2016 to 3.5% for 2017. The market expects the inflation target will remain unchanged at 3%, and the money supply (M2) growth target will be lowered to 12% (vs. 13% last year). There are also a few February economic numbers to be released in China (including FX reserves morning of Tuesday 7th March, imports/exports Wednesday 8th March, and CPI/PPI morning of Thursday 9th March).\n\nEuropean Central Bank Meeting\n\nThe ECB meeting on Thursday 9th March should be relatively uneventful, with officials likely to push back further against rising expectations for a tightening in policy.\n\nUS Numbers\n\nIn the US, the February jobs report released on Friday 10th March will be the last major economic data point before the 15th March Federal Open Market Committee decision. Certainly the jobs report could prove pivotal for the Fed as it decides whether to hike rates on 15th March or later. Economists are modelling total job adds of ~175K (vs. 227K in Jan). For what it’s worth, Federal-funds futures contracts say there’s a 94% probability that the central bank will lift its key interest rate target by 25 basis points (one-quarter of a percentage point), to 0.75% to 1%.', 'Did you buy the post-earnings dip in Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) last month? Since hitting a low near $812 on Feb. 1, GOOGL stock has steadily bounced back, regaining more than 3% of the ground it lost following a poorly received fourth-quarter earnings report.\n\nBut you haven’t missed out on the fun. Alphabet stock still has some gas in the tank.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge Alphabet’s bounce from the $812 region was not happenstance. The shares were bolstered by support from their rising 50-day moving average, and a wealth of psychological support from the nearby $800 area. Furthermore, GOOGL stock has been in rally mode since mid-2015, gaining some 53% during this time frame.\n\nIn other words, the post-earnings dip was less about poor quarterly results and more about an excuse to take some profits off the table.\n\nHowever, now that the situation has corrected itself, and Alphabet stock has emerged from an overbought situation, shares should be poised to run higher.\n\nIf you took my bullish GOOGL recommendation on Jan. 31 and got into the March $830/$850 bull call spread, you are likely already at breakeven or sitting on a profit for the trade. What’s more, the odds of breaking out above $850 have improved significantly in the past couple of weeks.\n\nAlternately, if you took the more neutral-to-bullish option and entered the March $800 put sell, you can all but rest easy now that GOOGL stock is headed higher once again.\n\nIf you missed out on those trades, though, there’s still time to get in before Alphabet Inc tops out again.\n\nSentiment for Alphabet remains as bullish as ever, with nearly all of the 48 analysts tracked by Thomson/First Call rating GOOGL stock a “buy.” Additionally, the 12-month price target has risen over the past month to $990.72, and that bodes well for the shares going forward, as it cuts down on the likelihood of downgrades to “hold” over the short-term.\n\nAs for options traders, a bit of caution has crept into GOOGL options since Alphabet’s quarterly report, but this, too, is healthy for the shares. Currently, the March put/call open interest ratio rests at 0.76, up from pre-earnings readings near 0.85.\n\nFurthermore, peak March call OI rests well overhead at $900, meaning that Alphabet should see little in the way of potential options-related resistance.\n\nNext Page', 'MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA - On the heels of self-driving vehicles, drone delivery services, and more, Google parent Alphabet is looking to push itself even further in the transport industry with its latest project: ride-sharing.\n\nAnd it wants it to be done in semi-autonomous vehicles.\n\nHaving separated the project into a new Alphabet holding company, called Waymo according to Bloomberg Technology, the company said that the next step is “to let people use our vehicles to do everyday things like run errands, commute to work, or get safely home after a night on the town.”\n\nThe service is in partnership with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles North America–specifically minivans–trying its self-driving technology, possibly by this time next year.\n\nSources that wished to remain anonymous but are close to the matter told Bloomberg that Google will deploy a semi-autonomous version of the Chrysler Pacifica minivan that it’s developing with the Italian-American carmaker as early as end of 2017.\n\n“FCA has been a wonderful partner,” CEO of Waymo John Krafcik, stated at a recent San Francisco event. The only other progress the executive made on the developing program was that the company is currently adding new sensors to Chrysler vehicles.\n\nThis is the third Uber-like launch from the Internet and tech giant. As we have previously reported, Alphabet has launched a self-driving truck venture, gathering great minds of the Silicon Valley from companies like Apple, Tesla, Cruise Automation, and others. Google is also looking to put on the market its own self-driving car, as our sister publication The Snack Magazine reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest project, those close to the matter told Bloomberg that Google will need more than the 100 Pacificas it agreed to develop with Fiat Chrysler in May. Currently, it has announced plans to create about 100 prototypes based on the Chrysler Pacifica hybrid-powered minivan for Google to test its self-driving technology.\n\nWho will win this cutting-edge race to bring us into the next chapter of transportation and, eventually, a more efficient way to transfer people and produce alike?\n\nOn your marks, get set, go!\n\nAlphabet Inc.', 'Google’s self-driving car company has been spun into an independent company, now called Waymo.\n\nWaymo will be an independent company part of Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. The self-driving cars have been driving around the Phoenix area since April as part of tests for the new technology.\n\nIn a statement, Waymo says it will start commercializing the self-driving cars and its attached technology.\n\nArizona was the fourth state to start testing out the cars, and Waymo will continue to test its cars in the region. The company recently opened up its first facility in Chandler, and has expanded the testing around the Valley.\n\nWaymo said the greater Phoenix area’s unique desert conditions have helped it analyze how the car’s sensors handle extreme temperatures and dust in the air.\n\nMany U.S. companies have been working to make self-driving cars a reality with reports of testing across the country.\n\nWaymo plans to let people use its vehicles for everyday things like, heading to work, running errands and more.\n\nWould you take a ride in a self-driving car?', 'Google parent Alphabet Inc. is spinning out its driverless-car technology from a research lab into its own business unit, called Waymo, that soon will be expected to start earning revenue.\n\nAlphabet GOOG, +0.19% GOOGL, +0.29% executives had said they planned to graduate the self-driving-car project from Alphabet’s research lab, X. The move signals that the technology is nearing commercial viability.\n\nFormer auto executive John Krafcik, who has led Alphabet’s driverless-car project for the past several years, will stay as Waymo’s chief executive\n\nKrafcik said that the company was the first to test a self-driving car on public roads without a human driver in the vehicle. A blind man rode in a Waymo car that doesn’t have a steering wheel or brake pedals in Austin, Texas, last year, he said.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\n\nPopular on WSJ.com:\n\nThere’s an antidote to America’s economic malaise: college towns\n\nStudent-debt forgiveness irks some borrowers', 'Alphabet Inc.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nSAN FRANCISCO When Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] was raising venture capital in 2013, it was one of the hottest deals around – and no one was more eager to write a check than Bill Maris and David Krane of Google\'s venture capital arm.\n\nNot everyone at Google Ventures, since renamed GV, agreed. The firm already had an investment in a competitor, Sidecar, and Uber was demanding what then looked like a sky-high valuation.\n\nMaris and Krane prevailed, and the deal is now regarded as GV’s greatest success.

Uber denies those claims.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by Alphabet’s self-driving car unit Waymo, has jolted the fast-growing and highly competitive industry that has sprung up around autonomous vehicles and ride services, which are seen as the future of private road transport.\n\nYet the confrontation was a long time in the making: the complex relationship between the companies was tense from the start, according to people familiar with the situation, and soured further as they increasingly competed with each other.\n\nNow, if the Waymo suit damages Uber, GV\'s investment in the ride-hailing company stands to go down as a Silicon Valley rarity: a large funding deal undermined by the firm\'s own investors.\n\n“Whatever Waymo gains, Google Ventures loses,” said Stephen Diamond, associate professor of law at Santa Clara University.\n\nThe lawsuit is just one in a series of recent public setbacks for Uber, including allegations of sexual harassment that prompted an internal investigation, a video of Chief Executive Travis Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver that led him to make a public apology, and Uber\'s admission on Friday that it used a secret tracking tool to avoid authorities.\n\n“We have reviewed Waymo\'s claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court,"" Uber said in a statement in response to the lawsuit. ""In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world.”\n\nA spokeswoman for GV declined to comment.\n\nDEAL AT ANY COST\n\nUber was more than just another investment for then-fledgling Google Ventures, which needed a high-profile deal to put it on the map.\n\nMaris and Krane were early Uber fans, but it took about two years for the pair to connect with Kalanick. When Uber investor Benchmark finally brokered a meeting in May 2013, the Google Ventures partners were determined to do a deal at virtually any cost, according to two sources close to the transaction.\n\nWith other would-be investors waiting in adjacent conference rooms at Uber’s San Francisco offices, Maris and Krane made their pitch to invest. Kalanick pushed for a higher valuation, without a board seat; Google Ventures pushed back, asking for a board observer seat and a liquidation preference for protection if Uber was sold at a loss, one of the sources said.\n\nThey finally came to terms, with a $3.5 billion valuation, and there were signs that a broader alliance could be in the offing. Separately, David Drummond, Google\'s senior vice president of corporate development, had a social relationship with Kalanick, and he joined the board.\n\nA ride in a self-driving car and a meeting with Google CEO Larry Page, recounted in Brad Stone\'s recent book ""The Upstarts,"" seemed to bode well for the relationship.\n\nBut conflicts emerged immediately. Kalanick, a tough negotiator, wanted a discount on the software tools behind Google Maps, the company\'s ubiquitous mapping software, according to a person close to the transaction. The best Google Ventures could offer was close contact between Uber and Google’s mapping team, the person said.\n\nKalanick also wanted Uber to be featured prominently in Google Maps, eventually giving customers a way to hail an Uber ride directly from Maps, and Google agreed, a source close to Uber said. But Uber felt Google dragged its heels on the integration and found the initial rollout disappointing, the source said.\n\nThe friction only grew as Uber turned its attention to autonomous driving, an area where Google had already established an early lead. Uber announced its intentions in typically abrupt style in early 2015, poaching 40 faculty and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University to set up a self-driving lab in Pennsylvania.\n\nIt bought mapping software firm deCarta and began investing heavily in its own mapping systems. Meanwhile, Google launched an on-demand delivery service, a market Uber is also chasing, and began offering a carpooling service through driving app Waze, which it acquired in 2013. The carpooling feature in particular rankled Uber, a source close to the company said.\n\n""Things escalated from frenemy to now enemy quite quickly,"" said Anand Sanwal, CEO and co-founder of venture capital research firm CB Insights.\n\nThe tension bubbled to the surface last August, when Drummond stepped down from Uber’s board.\n\nUber declined comment on any of its dealings with Google and did not make Kalanick available for an interview.\n\nUNDERMINED BY ITS OWN INVESTORS?\n\nUber’s aggressive culture was the subject of many conversations at Google Ventures, a source close to the transaction said. Hoping to influence the startup, the venture firm at first encouraged a flow of talent from Google to Uber.\n\nYet that too ultimately created problems. Anthony Levandowski, a key engineering manager at the self-driving car unit, now called Waymo, began to talk openly about leaving the company as the autonomous vehicle field blossomed, according to Alphabet\'s lawsuit.\n\nIn January 2016, Levandowski and some colleagues quit Alphabet to form the self-driving truck start-up Otto, which Uber acquired later that year for $680 million. Alphabet claims in its lawsuit that Levandowski had been in touch with Uber even before he left Alphabet.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Alphabet alleges Levandowski downloaded 14,000 proprietary design documents and used them to create Otto\'s - and later Uber\'s - version of a key autonomous vehicle technology called Lidar, which uses light pulses reflected off objects to gauge their position.\n\nUber and Levandowski deny the allegations.\n\nThe high-stakes legal showdown over whether vital information was transferred between the two companies is perhaps the logical conclusion of their opaque relationship.\n\nAll along, Uber remained mysterious to its Google Ventures investors. Kalanick was adamant from the start that he would share little information, and try as it might, Google Ventures could not gain better visibility over time, two sources said. If anything, Kalanick grew more tight-lipped as his business matured.\n\n“It was one of the few companies where we sat there and said, \'Hope it goes well,\'"" one of the sources said.\n\n(Reporting by Julia Love and Heather Somerville; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Bill Rigby)', 'Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) subsidiary Google plans to expand its ride-sharing service in a bid to challenge Uber and Lyft, according to a new report.\n\nAfter a successful trial run in Israel and San Francisco, the tech giant has decided to launch its Waze navigation application in more U.S. cities and in Latin America, the Wall Street Journal (via Fortune) reported.\n\nThe company will start rolling out the service in new markets over the next few months.\n\nWaze is a GPS-based navigation application that was first developed by the Israeli company Waze Mobile. In 2013, Google bought Waze Mobile in a deal valued at $1.1 billion. As of June 2013, there were nearly 50 million Waze users, reported by Yahoo.\n\nWaze is different from Uber and Lyft. It does not work as an on-demand taxi service. Rather, the Waze app is designed to “persuade regular drivers using its navigation app to pick up people who are heading in the same direction,” the WJS reported.\n\n“Can we get the average person on his way to work to pick someone up and drop them off once in a while? That’s the biggest challenge,” Waze CEO Noam Bardin was quoted as saying by the Journal.\n\nMoreover, Waze’s prices are different from Uber and Lyft.\n\nA ride from downtown Oakland, Calif. to downtown San Francisco costs $4.50, where the same trip using either UberPool or Lyft Line is $10.57 and $12.40, respectively, according to the Journal.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.', 'Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) — also known as Google — announced that it will be expanding the locations in which it will test Waze.\n\nThe company said that it is excited to tap into the potential of Waze, a ride-sharing app that has some similarities to Uber and Lyft, but it is ultimately a cheaper alternative to both. The first two tests took place in Tel Aviv and the Bay Area, and they were successful.\n\nThe Waze Rider companion app will be rolled out in a number of US cities over the coming months, as well as Latin America. The Google project first came to fruition in Tel Aviv, where it was developed.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Waze is cheaper and simpler than its rival companies as the plan is to see if the company can get people to pick up and drop someone off on their way to work. “That’s the biggest challenge,” the company mentioned.\n\nA ride in the Bay Area is especially cheap on Waze as you can get from Oakland to downtown San Francisco for $4.50. The same trip with Uber would cost you anywhere between $10 and $12.\n\nWaze has to be booked more in advance than its rivals and it may not be as reliable as other companies. Which one would you rather ride in?\n\nGOOG stock lost 0.7% Thursday, while GOOGL shares slipped 0.7%.', 'Google is planning to expand a carpool service on its Waze navigation app, setting the tech company on a collision course with companies such as Uber Technologies Inc. that have a head start in the ride-sharing industry.\n\nGoogle is targeting launches of its Waze carpool service in several U.S. cities and Latin America over the next several months after testing in Israel and the San Francisco Bay Area met expectations, Waze chief Noam...', ""In his letter introducing Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) to investors, the conglomerate’s chairman, Larry Page, wrote that “the whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands.” The newly named company, Alphabet, was the grown-up Google, which had diverse interests and money-making ventures.\n\nAt the end of Alphabet’s first year as a conglomerate, things have not turned out as Page had anticipated.\n\nGoogle Is Still the Soul\n\nGoogle still remains the heart and soul of the company and the search engine mints money for the conglomerate. For example, the Mountain View company reported revenues of $22.2 billion in the latest quarter on the back of mobile and video advertising.\n\nTo put that into context, rival Facebook Inc. (FB) reported revenues of $17.9 billion for the entire year of 2015. Google is essentially the bank from which other ventures within the Alphabet umbrella borrow money to finance themselves. (See also: Google's Six Most Profitable Lines Of Business.)\n\nStruggling Ventures\n\nBut the individual brands that Page referenced in his introductory letter will take time to come into their own. They did not make news for all the right reasons in 2016.\n\nIn June, the New York Times reported that Nest founder and CEO Tony Fadell had quote the company after leadership problems. The company is a maker of hardware products and had been acquired by Google $3.2 billion back in 2014. Another casualty within the Alphabet umbrella was Google Fiber, the company’s broadband division. According to an October report in The New York Times, the company dismissed its 130 employees and stopped expansion to other cities.\n\nScaled-Back Ambitions\n\nGoogle also scaled back its ambitions of manufacturing a self-driving car after it failed to find a manufacturing partner. Instead, the self-driving unit was spun out into a separate software unit – called Waymo - that partners with established car manufacturers to install self-driving car technology. (See also: Google Spins Off New Self-Driving Car Technology.)\n\nPerhaps the overarching theme in these news bits is Alphabet’s attempts to rein in profligate spending, a quality that separates the company from its contemporaries. The entry of Ruth Porat from Morgan Stanley has brought about this change.\n\nA July report in the Wall Street Journal detailed Porat's efforts to pare spending by spending more judiciously on research and cutting back on profligate hiring. She has also forced divisions within the conglomerate to reconsider their moonshots within the context of costs and budgeting. A Bloomberg report towards the end of this year detailed how Google X, the company’s moonshots division, instituted cost controls and budgeting after her entry.\n\nRisks and Budgets\n\nThis does not mean that Alphabet has become a boring venture aimed at minting money and profits. It was the company’s unpredictability and willingness to take risks that endeared it to investors. The markets reflected that optimism and faith this year, when they pushed it to become the world’s most valuable company, surpassing rival Apple Inc. (AAPL).

But while Google expects Waymo to become a revenue source soon, it’s been attacked for seemingly falling behind in the self-driving car race.\n\nWaymo CEO John Krafcik, who by the way is an auto-industry veteran, made it clear that Waymo isn’t a car company.\n\nHe said Alphabet’s self-driving car business is into making better drivers. The Wall Street Journal paraphrased Krafcik as saying, “[Krafcik] saw opportunities in ride sharing, transportation logistics and trucking, as well as licensing technology to other auto makers.”\n\nThere were no definite statements on how the company intends to generate revenue, either. What is clear is that GOOGL is unlikely to make its own self-driving cars and investors should appreciate Alphabet’s approach. Here’s why.\n\nGoogle Leads the Self-Driving Car Race\n\nIn recent months, Google’s been criticized for slacking off in the self-driving car race. However, its self-driving cars have not logged over 2 million miles over the past eight years for nothing.\n\nOnly Tesla Motors Inc’s (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Autopilot program has logged more hours (100 million miles as of May 2016.) That’s because there are around 70,000 autopilot-enabled Tesla cars on the road.\n\nCritics have pointing to moves by traditional automakers like General Motors Company’s (NYSE: GM ) acquisition of Cruise Automation, and Tesla’s Autopilot, among others, as proof that GOOGL is now in the back seat. A report from earlier this year on how Toyota Motor Corp (ADR)(NYSE: TM ) had the highest number of patents related to self-driving cars also helped them buttress their points.\n\nAfter all, Toyota had over a thousand patents as of when the report was published, while GOOGL only had a few hundred patents. However, what’s not being said is that the patents Alphabet holds are mostly related to Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-Infrastructure (V2I) technologies.\n\nNext Page', 'Published By: Ken Bock on December 19, 2016 09:25 am EST\n\nAlphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo with its partner, Fiat Chrysler, since May reveals almost 100 self-driving minivans. The minivan fleet has been specifically modified so that it can be tested in California, Arizona, and Michigan. This is the first time the company has managed to work with an automaker to create the self-driving vehicles.\n\nThe minivans will be seen on roads next year according to blog post made by the CEO of Waymo, John Krafick, on Sunday. The autonomous minivans consist of new computers, better sensors, and other system updates. Sensors can be seen on the front and the back of the vehicle. Fiat modified that structure, powertrain, and the exterior of the vehicle.\n\nThis was a fresh start for Alphabet to announce Waymo, it was rumored to kill its self-driving car project entirely a while ago. These rumors have been proven the complete opposite. Waymo and Fiat will be seen on the roads very soon, possibly in 2017. Waymo and Fiat are using their individual’s sources and strength to manufacture the best possible self-driving cars out there.\n\nThe CEO of Waymo, Joh Krafcik said, “The Pacifica Hybrid will be a great addition to our fully self-driving tests fleet. FCA’s product development and manufacturing teams have been agile partners. Enabling us to go from program kickoff to full vehicle assembly in just six months. They’ve been great partners, and we look forward to continues teamwork with them as move into 2017.”\n\nSome of the prototypes of these minivans have gone through tests already, which include the ‘extreme weather’ tests that last for 200 hours. The tests were conducted in California at the company’s own track and even Fiat’s test areas in Arizona and Michigan.', 'Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV announced the production of 100 Pacifica Hybrid minivans which will join Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo self-driving vehicle fleet.\n\nThe minivans are currently being being outfitted with fully self-driving technology, including purpose-built computers and a suite of sensors, telematics and other systems, and will become part of the test fleet of Waymo, formerly the Google car project, in early 2017, the Italian-American manufacturer said Monday in a statement.\n\nWaymo Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan Source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\n\nFiat Chrysler, the first major automaker to strike a deal with Alphabet’s Google for autonomous vehicles, has favored cooperating with tech giants to navigate potentially profound changes in the car industry. The company will reveal a fully electric vehicle based on the Chrysler Pacifica at the CES electronics show in Las Vegas next month as it pushes for a role in an industrywide shift toward battery-powered models, people familiar with the matter said last week.\n\nWaymo plans to start a ride-sharing service with Fiat Chrysler’s minivans as part of a reorganization of the tech company’s automotive unit, people familiar with the matter said Dec. 13. Waymo will deploy a semi-autonomous version of the Pacifica for the new service as early as the end of 2017, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the matter is private. Alphabet and Fiat Chrysler declined to comment on their plans.\n\nThe U.S. tech company separated its autonomous vehicle project into the new Alphabet holding company Waymo earlier this month. For the service, Google will need more than the 100 Pacificas it agreed to develop with Fiat Chrysler in May, the people said.', 'Alphabet Inc stock is likely to outperform in 2017.\n\n\n\nFlickr\n\nShares of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had a much better start to 2017 after finishing 2016 with just a modest return of 2%. Investors did not bid GOOGL stock higher in 2016 even after the company posted continuous double-digit revenue growth throughout the year. GOOGL stock is already up more than 8% YTD and we believe it is most likely to outperform in 2017. While Alphabet Inc\'s search and digital advertising businesses continue to be key revenue drivers for the tech behemoth, some latest developments suggest many more key growth drivers for the company going ahead. These new growth drivers suggest GOOGL stock could be headed much higher. Here\'s Why.\n\nYouTube To Bring In More Ad Dollars Now.\n\nAlphabet Inc\'s video platform YouTube recently unveiled YouTube TV, its live TV streaming service. The subscription costs $35-a-month for a package of 40-plus channels. However, there are a quite a few holes in the YouTube offering. As it does not include some of the major networks like AMC Networks, Discovery Communications, Time Warner, A+E Networks and Viacom networks and this service is not available in all regions of US, an incremental roll-out is planned. However, this is a step in the right direction. YouTube was the biggest driver of ad revenue growth for Alpahbet Inc in 2016. Alphabet Inc does not disclose the break up of revenue from YouTube alone but Jefferies analysts calculated that it brought in about $12 billion in revenue last year. With YouTube TV now, Google can have a crack at the TV ad market.\n\nThough the advertising details of YouTube TV have not been disclosed, industry experts see YouTube helping Google get a pie of the TV ad market. William Blair‘s Ralph Schackert is very bullish over the long-term about YouTube\'s latest offering as he points out ""TV advertising is a $185 billion annual market, and pay TV is $275 billion, therefore, both are very attractive markets for YouTube to chip away at over the longer term."" The TV ad market would be extra add dollars YouTube would bring, in addition to the ones it is currently making on its platform. According to the latest data disclosed, people now watch 1 billion hours of YouTube per day. The rise in viewing hours could help it grow revenues at a much faster pace.\n\nAnother key point to note here is that with YouTube TV you also get many other value added benefits, one of them being access to YouTube Red, a $10 per month original content service from YouTube. A recent study also suggests original content is helping Google’s YouTube get new subscribers. However crowded the competition Youtube\'s offering is likely to appeal to a niche audience. If AT&T’s DirecTV Now which was so buggy at launch can manage to ""acquire 200,000 subscribers in its first month, without impacting its rivals’ growth,"" according to Sling TV CEO Roger Lynch, then YouTube is expected to do much better than that. If that happens to be true, then as William Blair‘s Ralph Schackert suggests, YouTube may receive ""a warm reception from TV advertisers"".\n\nAlphabet\'s Recent Upgrade To AA-plus Corporate Credit Rating Is A Bullish Signal.\n\nAlphabet Inc was recently upgraded to AA-plus corporate credit rating at S&P Global. Alphabet\'s latest rating is only one rating below Standard & Poor\'s AAA rating, the scale\'s highest level. This highest level rating is only exclusively awarded to Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson. This upgrade clearly suggests the strong future outlook of the tech giant. To quote S&P Global analyst David Tsui: ""The ratings upgrade reflects Alphabet’s consistently strong operating performance, despite a challenging and evolving digital advertising market, while it continues to maintain a conservative financial policy and strong liquidity profile."" All this adds to many growth drivers in front of the parent body of the search engine giant Google. Alphabet Inc\'s next growth cycle could be closer than we think. As a Motley Fool post highlights, Alphabet’s Waymo leads the field in driverless car space and ""could be moving toward monetization sooner than anyone else.""\n\nSumming It Up.\n\nGOOGL stock has made a good start to the year and in a recent research note, Goldman Sachs reiterated their buy rating on shares of Alphabet Inc with a price target of $970.00. This reaffirms the belief that GOOGL stock is headed higher. With YouTube TV, Google may work itself into a position of strength to tap into the massive TV ad market, which could help revenues grow faster than expected. In Waymo, Alphabet Inc may soon find its next big growth driver with the driverless car trend picking up pace. As a The Street post points out with Alphabet trading at a forward multiple of 22, GOOGL stock ""comes at a massive bargain to the internet service and software peer group average of 48 times which is heavily skewed by Amazon\'s astronomical forward price-to-earnings ratio of 117."" This is after taking into account projected 19% EPS growth of GOOGL stock over the next 5 years. Hence, long-term investors should buy GOOGL stock, and buy more of it on every dip.\n\nLooking for great tech stocks?

The brokerage firm also waxed optimistic on, saying the company is ""extremely well positioned,"" and cited ""enthusiasm among its advertisers"" over changes to its core search. However, at least one analyst more recently expressed reservations about the Google Pixel smartphone.Specifically, Flurry Analytics looked at the most popular smartphone brands in the week leading up to Christmas. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was in the lead thanks to its iPhone, followed by Samsung, Huawei, and LG. However, GOOGL was noticeably absent. ""With only two devices, the Pixel and Pixel XL, and mixed market reception, Google struggled to drum up excitement this holiday season,"" Flurry opined.This isn\'t the only space in which Alphabet has struggled to win supporters. In the options pits, too, trading activity has tilted in an unusually bearish direction. The stock\'s 10-day put/call volume ratio of 0.91 at the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) sits just 1 percentage point from a 12-month peak.

In other words, options in the front three-months\' series are pricing in extremely low volatility expectations.Technically speaking, though, there hasn\'t been much to see on the charts. For the past five months, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been chopping sideways around the $800 level, last seen at $800.79. In fact, the post-election boost that most stocks have seen hasn\'t benefited GOOGL shares, which are actually lower relative to their Nov. 8 close.\n\nSign up now for Schaeffer\'s Market Recap to get all the day\'s big stock movers, must-know technical levels, and top economic stories straight to your inbox.', 'Although the euphoric phase of smartwatch mania has come and gone, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) is in the unusual position of just now getting serious about the market.\n\nSource: Brad Moon\n\nIt’s launching not one but two second-generation Android-powered, wrist-worn devices in early 2017.\n\nOther manufacturers are also expected to unveil smartwatches based on the Android operating system during the coming year, distinguishing its smartwatch business model from the one employed by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Only Apple makes smartwatches that utilize the iOS operating system.\n\nWill Alphabet do what Apple wasn’t able to do, which is measurably improve the value of GOOGL stock by tapping into the relatively new category of consumer technology?\n\nMaybe, but if it does, it’s going to take a massive paradigm shift that hasn’t even come close to taking shape yet.\n\nNumbers Don’t Lie\n\nMost owners of GOOGL stock may not even realize that Google actually beat Apple to the smartwatch market by launching one in 2014. Indeed, that’s a key tenet of the problem. If people don’t realize Alphabet makes such a device already, it’s because the company has done a poor job of marketing itself.\n\nFortunately for Alphabet shareholders, this shouldn’t be an impasse with the upcoming unveilings.\n\nUnfortunately, better marketing and more consumer familiarity with the idea of wearables isn’t going to help much.\n\nSee, the smartwatch market is not a significant market for companies that drive tens of billions of dollars worth of revenue per year selling goods and services other than smartwatches. As of the most recent tally, only 39.5 million U.S. adults are expected to be smartwatch users by the end of the year. Initial estimates from a year ago said that figure would be 63.7 million.\n\nFor comparison, as of the end of last year, 68% of the nation’s 242 million adults own smartphones. That’s 164 million smartphone owners, most of whom just don’t see the advantage of yet another piece of technology on their person.\n\nWe’re seeing comparable metrics on a global basis.\n\nWhat’s It Going to Take?\n\nTo answer the overarching question of marketability, look at the feedback consumers have served up about the Apple Watch and other smartwatches. Each device has some rabid fan because … well, there’s always someone who finds something to love about anything. But some of the criticisms have been repeatedly voiced.\n\nNext Page', 'Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has long been a favorite of option traders due to its high share price and juicy option premiums. With the stock trading at $804, it has basically gone nowhere since late-2015.\n\nWith a massive technological revolution currently taking place, Alphabet is well placed to take advantage of potential boom industries in self-driving cars and virtual reality.\n\nAmigobulls recently reported that “self-driving cars could actually come sooner than many people think”, due to recent regulations introduced by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.\n\nOn December 14, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s self-driving technology efforts became an official company called Waymo, which stands for a new way forward in mobility.\n\nCompetition in the self-driving car space is already pretty fierce, with Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) leading the charge, but Alphabet and Waymo still have potential to grab a significant share of the market.\n\nWaymo plans to focus on working with auto manufacturers to provide the tech, rather than building their own cars. This seems sensible given tech is their area of expertise rather than car making.\n\nIn addition to self-driving cards, the virtual reality market is set to heat up over the next few years. Forbes recently listed Alphabet as one of 11 stocks to watch in this $80 billion market.\n\nThe article reported that Alphabet is “already building a new version of Glass and has secretly distributed the product to health care, manufacturing and energy companies.”\n\nLooking at the charts, while Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is basically at the same level it was a year ago, it has had a nice run up since July. After consolidating since August, the stock could look to push above the 52 week high at $840 sometime in early 2017.\n\nOptions traders can take advantage of a bullish stance in Alphabet by trading bull put spreads.\n\nIf trader were willing to bet that GOOGL will stay above $800 between now and March they could sell a March 17th, 2017 $800-$790 spread.\n\nFor selling that spread, they would receive $410 in option premium. The maximum loss would occur if GOOGL traded below $790 on the expiry date. The maximum loss would be $590.\n\nTherefore, traders will to bet on a table to higher GOOGL share price between now and March could receive a juicy 69% return on their investment.\n\nFollow Alphabet Inc.

Although, it did lag behind one of its fiercest rivals, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), whose stock logged a return of 34%. And both paled in comparison with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), which mustered 40% gains for its shareholders.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOf course, for Alphabet Inc, the company will not have the same kind of high-growth rates of past. The revenue base is simply too massive.\n\nThis does not mean the stock will somehow get stuck, however. If anything, there are some positive long-term drivers that should benefit shareholders in the coming year and beyond. Let’s take a look at three:\n\nGOOGL Stock Driver #1 — Tech Megatrends\n\nWhile the online advertising industry has been around for over two decades, there remains lots of room for growth. According to IDC, the global spending is forecast to go from $177.3 billion in 2015 to $315.7 billion in 2020. Some of the key drivers include: the ubiquity of internet access and smartphones, the advantages of tracking/analytics, personalization, and the increased use of video.\n\nAll this is certainly good news for holders of GOOGL stock. Consider that the company derives about 90% of its revenues from online advertising. More importantly, Alphabet has a tremendous platform, which includes seven properties that have over a billion users (the main Google property, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Chrome, Android and Play).\n\nThe result is that the company is getting an outsized share of the online ad opportunity. In the latest quarter, GOOGL reported a 20% increase in revenues to $22.45 billion. Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, said: “Our services are prime time for the mobile world.” After all, Alphabet Inc controls a whopping 95% of the mobile search market.\n\nGOOGL Stock Driver #2 — Bold Innovation\n\nFrom inception, the DNA of GOOGL has been about pushing the envelope on innovation. Granted, sometimes there have been embarrassing flops. But hey, this is critical for achieving success (keep in mind the countless times Thomas Edison failed until he figured out the light bulb).\n\nSo yes, the company has continued to release innovative products. Some of the recent ones include the Pixel phone, Duo (a video chat app), Google Home (a voice-activated speaker) and Allo (a smart messaging app).\n\nBut perhaps the technology that has the most potential to be transformative for GOOGL stock is artificial intelligence. The company’s long history of building and leveraging massive databases is definitely a huge advantage (the knowledge base consist of over 70 billion facts about people, places and things).\n\nBasically, with AI, the opportunity is to make technology natural and seamless — not something you need to activate, enter information into or boot up. In other words, the systems will crunch data to learn and adapt.\n\nOh, and the monetization could be enormous. As InvestorPlace.com’s Aaron Levitt recently wrote:\n\n“In the end, Alphabet is setting itself up to be the absolute king of data collection. Moving beyond the desktop and mobile phone and into our daily lives is the next step in how it will better compete and drive advertising sales. This shift is the next evolution in its business model.”\n\nNext Page', ""GOOGL stock is currently undervalued when compared to its peers, but that could change in 2017.\n\nAlphabet stock underperformed the market by a significant margin in 2016.\n\nThis can be attributed to investors worrying about Google's declining margins and rising costs.\n\nThis might however, change once investors start focusing more on the company's growth outlook.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock badly underperformed the market in 2016, finishing with a modest return of just 2% vs. 11% by the S&P 500. More notably, GOOGL stock underperformed its FANG counterparts consisting of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), with all but Netflix finishing the year with double-digit gains. The stock appears to have taken a breather after rallying hard - 45% over the previous 2 years.\n\nGOOGL stock is undervalued\n\nWhile GOOGL stock has underperformed, Alphabet has continued posting strong top and bottom line growth, and the shares now look undervalued. At a valuation of 10 times EBITDA versus 19.2 times for Amazon and 13.5 times for Facebook, the shares look cheaper than what the company's growth calls for, suggesting the market has not fully priced-in Google's strong growth.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, the underperformance by GOOG stock can be chalked up to Alphabet's deteriorating core margins and investors focusing on deleveraging of traffic acquisition costs. Alphabet's operating margin has fallen sharply from 35.4% in 2010 to 26.3% currently. Margins have been eroding due to falling CPCs (Cost Per Click) and rising traffic acquisition costs.\n\nGoogle's Cost-Per-Click has continued declining due to the increasing exposure to international markets. More than half the company's revenue comes from international markets, where lower ad pricing and adverse effects of a strong dollar are major headwinds. Meanwhile, Google's search ads form the bulk of its revenue and command better prices than display ads on platforms like YouTube due to higher engagement rates. Unfortunately, Google's search business is becoming increasingly saturated making it harder for search CPC to improve.\n\nAlso Read: Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL) Next Growth Cycle Is Closer Than You Think\n\nGoogle's increasing traffic acquisition costs, or TAC, have also been pressuring margins. TAC refers to the fees the company pays to partner websites that run Google ads. The portion of TAC that Google pays to distribution partners to make its search engine the default option on rival platforms such as the iOS on iPhones jumped 33% during the last quarter, much higher than the top line growth of 20%. Google says this trend is due to the fact that its strongest growth areas, including mobile and programmatic advertising, naturally have higher TAC.\n\nWhy these concerns are overblown\n\nIt appears as if investors have been overreacting and missing the forest for the trees. Google remains by far the most dominant ad company with good growth runways. During the past few quarters, revenue growth has been accelerating, a remarkable feat for a company its size. Indeed, Google stock has kicked off the year on a strong note after racking up gains of 4.7% in the first two weeks of trading. That's better than the 1.6% gained by the S&P 500, but worse than Facebook's 9.6%, Amazon's 6.6%, and Netflix's 5.4% over the timeframe.\n\nMeanwhile, Google websites and new initiatives like the Pixel remain in the pink of health. Google derives 80% of its revenue from its own websites rather than partner sites. And the good news is that revenue on Google websites has consistently been growing much faster than AdSense revenue from partner sites. During the last quarter, Google websites brought in revenue of $16,089 million, up 23% Y/Y, while Google's partner revenue was $3,732 million, up a mere 1%. The huge disparity in growth rates could be the result of Google cracking down hard on low-quality sites that try to game marketers by offering search spam. But it also has a more nuanced side: Google is increasingly relying less and less on partner sites for its revenue, meaning its TAC is likely to remain under control.\n\nMeanwhile, Pixel has been one of the company's most successful hardware innovations. Morgan Stanley estimates the company will sell ~6 million units in 2017, bringing in $4 billion in revenue and $900 million in gross profit. 6 million units pale in comparison with what Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) manages with the iPhone - more than 200 million units sold in 2016. $4 billion might also not look like much for a company with annual revenue of nearly $80 billion. Yet, the Pixel is an important part of Alphabet because it's actually the only non-search segment that's profitable. Alphabet's ''Other Bets'' have been growing too slowly, while posting huge losses and acting as a big drag on the company's bottom line. Other Bets contributed less than $800 million to the company's top line over the past 12 months, but posted a huge operating loss of nearly $4 billion.\n\nAlso Read: Is Amazon (AMZN) Becoming A Threat To Alphabet (GOOGL)?\n\nPixel will also give Alphabet a means to offer a more integrated and consistent Android experience to the more than 1.4 billion Android users worldwide. Pixel might not grow into the iPhone-killer it was originally hyped to become, but it's likely to lead to materially faster revenue and profit growth for Alphabet in the coming years.\n\nThe bottom line on GOOGL stock\n\nInvestors have been focusing too much on the finer details of Alphabet's growth metrics and in the process missing the bigger picture. But with the company's growth on an uptick and the shares looking significantly undervalued, it's only a matter of time before the market rewards GOOGL stock investors. With earnings projected to grow at nearly 18% in 2017, double-digit gains for Google stock might be on the cards.\n\nLooking for great tech stocks?

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n\nAlphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) self-driving car unit Waymo on Friday added a new patent claim to its intellectual property lawsuit against Uber Technologies Inc and requested a preliminary injunction to stop the ride-sharing service from using what it says is proprietary information, a court filing showed.\n\nThe two Silicon Valley companies are fighting over technology that is seen as part of the foundation of the future of transportation, self-driving vehicles.\n\nThe fight is also shaping up as a rematch of legal titans from another case that riveted Silicon Valley: the smartphone patent battle between Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS). Morrison Foerster, which represents Apple in that case, on Friday said it would represent Uber in the suit by Alphabet. Alphabet is represented by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, which represents Samsung.\n\nWaymo sued Uber last month over allegations that a former employee downloaded and stole more than 14,000 confidential files, including details on light detection and ranging sensor technology known as Lidar.\n\nUber has denied the claims. It did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\nLidar systems are similar to radar and shoot light beams to map out a street or environment. They are a crucial element of most self-driving car systems.\n\nWaymo, which originally said that two Lidar patents were infringed, on Friday in an amended complaint added a third patent. It also said that Uber infringed unpatented trade secrets, such as parameters and measurements for the light beam used in Lidar.\n\nIt also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on the Lidar technology in question.\n\n(Reporting by Dan Levine, Julia Love and Peter Henderson; Editing by Leslie Adler and Grant McCool)"", 'Rising mobile search volume is putting pressure on Alphabet Inc\'s margins.\n\n\n\nFlickr\n\nChanges in the way people access the internet are causing some trouble for Mountain View, California-based search engine giant Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), formerly known as Google. People are no longer waiting to reach their home or office to access their desktops. Rather, more and more people are googling on their mobile devices. More searches are happening on mobile than on desktop. This shifting trend represents both an opportunity as well as a challenge for Google. During the latest earnings call, Google\'s CFO Ruth Porat mentioned mobile as one of the important growth drivers. However, rising mobile search is also impacting Google\'s margins. In its latest quarterly earnings release, Google’s parent Alphabet reported a miss on its earnings, largely due to the decline in cost per click, which was impacted by the increase in mobile search.\n\nGoogle mobile ads get more clicks but make less money.\n\nFor a while now, mobile search has been growing at a much faster clip than desktop search. According to marketing research firm, eMarketer, in the United States, mobile search volumes surpassed desktop search volumes last year. The rising growth in mobile search has benefitted Google as it has been able to corner a large part of the mobile search business. According to Digital marketing firm Merkle, Google received 96% of all search-ad clicks on mobile devices in the fourth quarter.\n\nSource: eMarketer\n\nHowever, the problem for Google is that mobile ads fetch lesser money than desktop ads. Cost per click, or the money google makes every time a user clicks an ad continued to fall in the fourth quarter. Google\'s strategy for mobile has largely been to either figure out new advertising formats, or generate more money from the much larger volume of impressions mobile devices generate. Until now, Google has been able to offset its declining cost-per-click with more impressions to generate impressive results. But Google will need to figure out a way to improve its cost-per-click on mobile.\n\nGoogle is facing a rising threat from Amazon Inc.\n\nThe predominance of mobile is also changing the way people search. People looking to travel are more likely to search on the Priceline or Expedia app, rather than going through Google search. The same is the story with shopping. People who are planning to buy products are more likely to start their search on Amazon, than on Google. According to a report on Business Insider, Amazon is slowly eating into Google\'s territory by becoming the go-to place for eCommerce search. Around 52% of people start their search for online shopping on Amazon, and only 26% use search engines like Google as the starting point. While Amazon is currently a tiny player in the ad business with its 2016 ad revenues coming in at $1.2 billion, compared to Google\'s $79 billion, the rise of Amazon\'s Alexa could be a serious threat to Google.\n\nYet another trend which is likely to benefit Amazon is the rise in voice searches. With the arrival of personal assistants like Apple\'s Siri, Google Allo, Amazon\'s Alexa and Microsoft\'s Cortana, more people are finding it convenient to use these digital assistants, rather than typing a question into the search bar. Globally, voice-based searches jumped from almost zero to 10% in 2015 and doubled to 20% in 2016. With more people using voice searches, the importance of devices like Amazon\'s Echo and Google Home is only likely to increase. And currently, Echo is clearly the more popular device. Also, Alexa is finding its way into devices of several other companies like Ford, and even Google\'s Android ecosystem for that matter. Chinese firm Huawei Technologies, which manufactures android based smartphones announced during CES 2017 that its flagship handset will come with an app which will give its US users access to Alexa. According to Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, ""To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google’s voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that’s a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue,""\n\nAlphabet stock is still a good buy.\n\nThe shift in search trends are clearly a concern for Google. However, the company is making several efforts to capture more value from mobile ads. Google recently introduced new tools and features to AdWords to specifically address the consumer shift towards mobile, which will allow it to generate more value from mobile ads. In spite of these rising headwinds, Alphabet stock remains a good long-term buy. The average analysts\' price target of $990 indicates an 18% upside for GOOGL stock from the current price.', 'Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Pixel Phone holds a significant advantage over third-party Android smartphones. Since its release, Google Assistant — the new AI powered personal assistant — has been a Pixel Phone exclusive. Third-party smartphones remain stuck with the previous generation Google Now. However, Google released an Android “alpha” build late last week and the new Android release enables Google Assistant on third-party smartphones.\n\nSource: Google\n\nGOOGL’s third-party Android smartphone partners have been feeling a little betrayed since the release of the Pixel Phone last fall.\n\nUp until then, Google had not been directly competing against them. It developed Android and allowed them to use the operating system on their phones for free — a fair trade off for the hundreds of millions of mobile devices defaulting to revenue-generating Google search. Google did release the Nexus line of smartphones, but they were more of a showcase for Android than an attempt to compete against its partners.\n\nThe Pixel Phone’s Google Assistant Advantage\n\nThe Pixel Phone changed the equation. It was stamped with the Google name for the first time and it was designed to compete head-to-head with the best of the Android smartphones. In another first, a key new Android feature — Google Assistant — was a Pixel Phone exclusive. Google Assistant leverages Alphabet’s latest AI technology in a personal digital assistant that goes beyond Google Now, even gaining the ability to participate in two-way conversations.\n\nThe situation was serious enough to help convince Android smartphone leader Samsung Electronic Co Ltd (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) that it needed its own personal assistant. Samsung’s Bixby is expected to debut on the Galaxy S8.\n\nNew Android Release Spills the Beans: Google Assistant for All?\n\nAndroid Police examined a developer “alpha” release of Android over the weekend and discovered that GOOGL may be having a change of heart about keeping Google Assistant to itself.\n\nIts team was able to activate and use Google Assistant on several non-Pixel smartphones, including a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 running Android Marshmallow and a Nexus 6P running Android Nougat.\n\nThis means that GOOGL is at least experimenting with making Google Assistant available to third-party smartphones in an upcoming new Android release.\n\nNext Page', 'The Google Flights tool has stood in the shadow of the more well-known online travel leaders, however, some on Wall Street think the new and updated features could help Flights surpass them all.\n\nOn Friday, RBC Capital hosted a conference call with Research Director Luke Bujarski, Senior Research Analyst Jared Wein, and Skift Executive Editor Dennis Schaal to discuss Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) impact on the travel industry.\n\nAccording to Skift, Google Flights is gaining momentum and continues to see traction. Of note, Skift believes Google Flights is being particularly aggressive in the U.S. and appears to be gaining share from competitors. To put some context around this, according to Google Trends data, the term “Google Flights” in the U.S. rose 22-pts in January, compared with a 12-pt increase for “Kayak,” “Skyscanner” and “Momondo” combined. On the other hand, Google Hotel Ads, which is essentially Google’s metasearch platform, is underperforming relative to Google Flights.\n\n“Skift estimates Google owns up to 90% of the digital travel advertising market, translating into ~$12B of revenue in 2016 with the major OTA’s accounting for roughly half of that revenue. Among the OTA’s, Priceline pays Google the most, which Skift’s estimates is ~50% more than Expedia and >5x as much a TripAdvisor. Overall, Skift expects digital travel ad spend to grow 20% annually and believes the OTA’s will continue to hold the same share. That said, the OTA’s are likely to continue experimenting with other channels but these remain largely experimental and aspirational,” the RBC team noted.\n\nRBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney currently rates GOOGL at Buy, with a price target of $1025, which represents a potential upside of 23% from where the stock is currently trading.\n\nAccording to TipRanks.com, which measures analysts’ and bloggers’ success rate based on how their calls perform, analyst Mark Mahaney has a yearly average return of 21.4% and a 72% success rate. Mahaney has a 15.4% average return when recommending GOOGL, and is ranked #4 out of 4428 analysts.\n\nOut of the 29 analysts polled in the past 12 months, 27 rate Alphabet stock a Buy, 1 rates the stock a Hold and 1 recommends to Sell. With a return potential of nearly 18%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $989.14.', 'It wasn’t a good year for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) in 2016. Sure, it generated $17.1 billion in operating income through the first nine months of its current fiscal year on $64.2 billion in revenue, but at the end of the day GOOGL stock only managed a total return for shareholders of 1.9%.\n\nThat’s on par with its internet content peers, but way off the 12% delivered by the S&P 500. Not good by Google standards.\n\nHolding GOOGL stock back — a bit of a misnomer considering that it has nearly doubled the return of the S&P 500 over the past five years — is a valuation that InvestorPlace contributor Dana Blankenhorn feels is “priced to near-perfection” with a price-earnings ratio of 29 based on a consensus per-share earnings estimate of $26.90 in 2016, $32.25 in 2017 and $36.99 in 2018.\n\nSo, analysts expect Alphabet to grow earnings by 17.3% annually over the next two years — that’s a two-year PEG ratio of 1.7. By comparison, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) has a two-year PEG ratio of 1.6 based on annual EPS growth of 29%.\n\nFrom this perspective, GOOGL stock doesn’t look too bad; you have to conclude that either FB is overvalued at this point or GOOGL isn’t quite as expensive as people think.\n\nEspecially when you consider that there’s still gas in Alphabet’s tank.\n\nGoogle Travel Is Fueling GOOGL\n\nLeading the charge is its travel business which has quietly become a key element in Alphabet’s success. As the travel vertical prospers, so too does Google and its parent.\n\nAccording to Dennis Schaal of Skift, Google’s travel business will generate an estimated $12.2 billion in advertising revenue in 2016, accounting for 13.7% of Alphabet’s projected 2016 revenue of $89.3 billion. Put another way, Google’s travel business will generate approximately 1,670% [calculation: $12.2/4 multiplied by 3 divided by Other Bets Q1-Q32016 revenue of $547 million] more revenue in 2016 than its Other Bets segment, which includes much of the innovative work being done by the company, including Nest, Fiber, etc.\n\nOn its own, Google Travel would be a pretty large company with operating profits of $3.8 billion. While advertising might be boring, one can’t underestimate the importance of this vertical to the company’s profitable growth.\n\nAnd you can forget about Google becoming an online travel agency with this much money on the line. It’s not going to cut off its nose to spite the face. It’s just not.\n\n“Google’s existing revenue from travel advertisers is already considerably larger than that of the Priceline Group Inc (NASDAQ: PCLN ); is roughly twice the size of Expedia Inc’s (NASDAQ: EXPE ), and Google generates more travel advertising revenue than that of Expedia, Ctrip (NASDAQ: CTRP ) and TripAdvisor Inc (NASDAQ: TRIP ) combined,” wrote Schaal in his November 2016 article on the subject. “Google undoubtedly takes that travel-advertising revenue and achieves a much higher profit margin on it than do the roster of its online travel, airline, hotel, car rental and cruise partners.”\n\nNext Page', 'The digital-media industry has recently become a giant duopoly in which Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) are the key leaders. Ad industry veteran Jay Sears, Pivotal’s Wieser says that a majority of advertisers have to play by the rules of the two companies. Records indicate that their revenues were sharply up in 2016 with the third quarter of the year being the biggest ever. A total of $17.6 billion was spent on digital ads, which was a 20% increase from the same period a year earlier.\n\nHowever, this is very unfortunate for the startups because they may not get a grip on the market. In a research note to investors, Wiser wrote, “Smaller companies will continue to operate in the shadows of the industry’s two dominant players.”\n\nThe duopoly control has had an increasing impact on the advertising-tech market\n\nVenture Capital can easily conform to Google’s and Facebook’s market dominance. The company has been experiencing a downward trend of its activities since early 2015. Adtech, an umbrella term for companies that automate digital advertising has been having prominence in the last five years but it is now on a declining trend. These and others cannot monetize according to Balderton Capital venture partner Suranga Chandratillake who concurs that advertising is about selling attention. But sadly, a big chunk of the attention has been shifted to Google and Facebook and scaling up to compete with them is altogether another tall order.\n\nThe ad tech industry shrank 3% in the first half of 2016, which was at the expense of the two Californian giants. 85 cents of every new dollar spent on digital in the US last year went to the two companies. They have continued to build walled gardens that will help them tap their treasure troves\n\nSpending on digital ads in the U.S. will likely grow this year\n\nThere has been an era of real dramatic investment in the digital world. The ad: tech market is quickly embracing the search, social, and mobile platforms as investors and entrepreneurs concede to the Google’s and Facebook’s win. Meanwhile, Alphabets’ stock closed at $807.77 a decline of $0.24 or 0.03% while that of Facebook traded at $118.69 witnessing an increase of $1.83 or 1.57%.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.', 'The improvement of advertising tools the likes of the creation of better algorithms by Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) And Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has been the source of their improved adtech offerings. This has put Venture capital, which have been advertising technology startups at a tight corner. In 2017, global Venture capitalists funded a total of 343 adtech deals. Given that this was a 17% drop from a year ago, which made $3.2 billion in 2015, only $2.2 billion was made as investment from the said deals.\n\nWhile Adtech startups can only be referred to as middlemen, their role is to solve pain points created by a lack of tools. However, both Google and Facebook seem to have been on top of the game in squeezing the growth of independent adtech startups. They have to some extent taken dominance of the advertising market. A report by published in June by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers indicated that the two have an estimation of 75% of all new online ad spending.\n\nBut the duo has vast war chests to create or acquire adtech tools\n\nBeing able to acquire the right adtech tools is not a big neither for Google nor for Facebook. The two are able to invest as much as the market dictates in order to capture big algorithmic advancements. This is the biggest challenge according to U.S.-based venture capitalists that were able to invest just $860 million in advertising technology deals. On the other hand, the two internet giants have their strategies in place. For example, Google has the search engine while Facebook has the social network.\n\nSundar Pichai Google’s chief executive officer proclaims “Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.“ His counterpart, Facebook’s CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg says that his company has a stronghold that gives everyone the power of sharing out. However, advertisers have the option of choosing which strategy they want to explore.\n\nGoogle and Facebook have the latest artificial machines\n\nInnovation is the foundation of every success. That said, the two companies have invested in some of the smarter machines in the market in an effort to increase their revenues. However, they still have their competitive platforms that give their particular uniqueness. For example, Google is far ahead of a Facebook in video thanks to the explosive growth of YouTube. Clearly, there is intense speed in internet development, which is an advantage to the two companies. Meanwhile, Facebook’s stock closed at $116.82 an increase of %1.77 or 1.54% while that of Alphabet closed at $808.01 an increase of $15.56 or 1.96%.', 'With Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) introducing its new Zen-based Ryzen desktop into the market and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) announcing YouTube will now be offering a TV subscription to its user base, analysts from Rosenblatt and Baird are riding the bullish train on these two tech giants. One analyst believes Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) should be quaking, as AMD prepares to take the market by storm. Meanwhile, one of the top analysts on the Street is confident on Alphabet’s standing, predicting long-term growth lies ahead. Let’s dive in:\n\nAMD Offers Better Performing Desktop Than INTC at a Fraction of the Cost\n\nRosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann sees this week as an enticing time to chime in on AMD with the chip giant primed to accelerate desktop gains and re-capture the market from competitor Intel, thanks to AMD’s new Ryzen release. March is about to treat the chip giant well.\n\nIn reaction, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of AMD with a $16.50 price target, which represents a 13% increase from where the stock is currently trading.\n\nMosesmann sees AMD’s zen launch as one that is enough to rattle INTC investors, as he explains, “Zen-based Ryzen 7 desktop x86 CPU (available now) has disrupted the desktop PC gaming segment with the value proposition of half the price (of a ~$1K high end 8-core i7 series from Intel […] at better performance (~5%). Fair enough. AMD should gain share in desktops. The angle here is that gamers are likely to use that $500 savings to spend on a better display, or GPU card, or storage solution. An incremental tail wind for GPU spend. BUT the real take-way: The 8-core Ryzen 7 is a 95 watt rated CPU, over 30% more thrifty on energy than Intel’s 8-core i7 6900K. This is an eyebrow-raising event to say the least and likely due to a very efficient design not easily solved by Intel in the near-term (process or architecture-wise).”\n\n“We are in the camp of AMD re-capturing 10% or more of the x86 market in dollars (PC and server) as they did 7-8 years ago,” Mosesmann surmises.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, which measures analysts’ and bloggers’ success rate based on how their calls perform, five-star analyst Hans Mosesmann is ranked #357 out of 4,503 analysts. Mosesmann has a 54% success rate and realizes 12.3% in his annual returns. However, when suggesting AMD, Mosesmann loses 24.4% in average profits on the stock.\n\nTipRanks analytics demonstrate AMD as a Buy. Out of 22 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 10 are bullish on AMD stock, 10 remain sidelined, and 2 are bearish on the stock. With a loss potential of 25%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $10.92.\n\nAlphabet Raring to Take on Amazon/Prime and Netflix with New YouTube TV\n\nAlphabet revealed yesterday YouTube is ready to make a serious play into the over-the-top (OTT) content world by entering a highly-anticipated TV subscription offering into the mix. From the eyes of Baird top analyst Colin Sebastian, this move affirms Alphabet is “[…] taking OTT more seriously,” and he commends the undertaking as strategic.\n\nTherefore, as YouTube TV takes careful “aim at offline ad budgets,” the analyst reiterates an Outperform rating on GOOGL with a price target of $960, which represents a 12% increase from where the shares last closed.\n\nSebastian opines, “YouTube TV announcement suggests Google taking OTT more seriously. While long-rumored, yesterday’s announcement of YouTube TV subscription serve more formally established Google/YouTube as a player in the over-the-top (OTT) content and distribution market, and set to compete more directly with legacy cable/satellite networks as well as pure-play online subscription alternatives (e.g. Amazon/Prime Instant Video, Netflix.) We believe Google/YouTube is well positioned in the market with a large 1 billion+ active user base, significant streaming/download capabilities, and resources to license and create content.”\n\nIn fact, the analyst projects this step will not only generate further subscription revenue growth, but the news could also […] accelerate the migration of linear TV ad budgets online.”\n\nOverall, “Investments in original content likely to continue. We believe accelerated investment in owned/licensed and live content (YouTube mobile live streaming rolled out to channels with >10,000 subscribers) will be an important long-term driver of YouTube growth,” concludes Sebastian.\n\nColin Sebastian has a very good TipRanks score with a high ranking of #17 out of 4,503 analysts and a 78% success rate. Sebastian earns 18.9% in his yearly returns. When recommending GOOGL, Sebastian garners 17.0% in average profits on the stock.\n\nTipRanks analytics exhibit GOOGL as a Strong Buy. Based on 28 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 26 rate a Buy on Alphabet stock, 1 maintains a Hold, while 1 issues a Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $1,002.00, marking a 17% upside from where the stock is currently trading.\n\nMore stocks covered by top performing analysts can be found here.', 'Like this homebuilder stock has been named a ""top pick"" by Barron\'s (subscription required).

Instead of reaching that goal by 2025, the internet giant plans to achieve that by next year. This will include the energy used at all its offices across the globe as well as its data centers. Most of that renewable energy will be a mix of solar and wind.\n\n“To reach this goal we’ll be directly buying enough wind and solar electricity annually to account for every unit of electricity our operations consume, globally,” Google’s senior vice president for technical infrastructure, Urs Hölzle, wrote in an online posting.\n\nRenewable energy investment to continue\n\nAfter reaching its goal of using 100% renewable energy by next year, Google will still continue to invest in more renewable energy projects. This was stated in the internet giant’s inaugural comprehensive environmental report. This comes as the company continues expanding its cloud services which will mean that energy consumption will keep growing in tandem.\n\nBesides the renewable sources of energy being good hopefully for the environment, Google is also counting on generating cost savings. Wind energy costs have, for instance, fallen by more than 60%. At Google’s data centers, energy costs constitute a big component of operating expenses.\n\nLargest renewable energy buyer\n\nCurrently, Google is one of the biggest corporate buyers of renewable energy. Its move to renewable energy took on significant proportions in 2010 when it began with one deal. Then it purchased all the power generated by an Iowa wind farm, about 114MW. Such deals have now grown to reach 19. In a region like Asia where renewable energy is gathering steam, Google’s strategy will be to get into regional energy deals.\n\nThe achievement by Google in reaching its renewable energy goals is however restricted to Google only as other companies operating under Alphabet have different energy consumption levels. Plans are, however, underway to initiate sustainability efforts in the other Alphabet companies.\n\nIn Tuesday’s trading, Alphabet Inc closed the day lower at $776.18 having fallen by 0.26% from previous day’s trading.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.', 'Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and tech stocks as a group bounced in Monday’s trading session. And while one day does not make a trend, this is at least worthy of our attention. Considering that the prospects of a further year-end rally in stocks remains very much on the table, GOOGL stock and other tech equities could once again be atop the list of stocks to chase higher.\n\nBefore going any further and digging into the charts, there are two important points to understand for the month of December, as far as the stock market is concerned:\n\nWhile seasonal patterns often work as a good guide to the general direction of the stock market in various parts of the year, the year-end or “Santa Claus” rally in my opinion is one of the most reliable seasonal patterns.\n\nTo respect the possibility of this year-end lift in stocks, it is important to understand the dynamics behind it.\n\nSimilar to other month- and quarter-end periods throughout the year, December is a time when fund managers window-dress their portfolios. This is the practice of buying strong-performing stocks during the period and selling down losing ones to show investors that the fund was invested in the right stocks.\n\nIn December, this practice is magnified because under-performing fund managers also must try one last attempt to meet or beat the benchmarks against which their performance is measured, which in turn forces them to chase those stocks higher that had the best performance or show the most promise.\n\nThanks to this phenomenon, tech investments such as GOOGL stock could once again be on the buy radar heading into year’s end.\n\nGOOGL Stock Charts\n\nWhen I last discussed GOOGL on Nov. 17, I offered that the stock market seems to be rotating back into the tech sector.

The company has spent large amounts of money acquiring companies and investing in new upstarts. Google’s Project Wing, for example, recently announced plans that could soon boost the price of GOOGL stock.\n\nAlphabet announced plans to create an online exchange named “Wing Marketplace” that would allow customers to get deliveries from selected retailers and restaurants.\n\nDrone deliveries aren’t new, but they have not been officially approved in all 50 states. Alphabet is but one of several companies that has tested drone deliveries and showcased its successful launches, but it’s also highlighted possible concerns.\n\nAn announcement like this isn’t usually that exciting. However, Alphabet named two companies that are actively looking at using this service, which would give the GOOGL Wing project a huge tailwind. Both Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NASDAQ: WFM ) and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE: DPZ ) are considering using this service in some capacity.\n\nWhile they have already declined to sign on due to concerns over the user experience, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) also considered the Wing Marketplace as an optional coffee delivery system.\n\nDelivering groceries by drone might need some work (how much weight can a drone carry and how much power will that require?). Delivering items like pizza or fast food, however, are more realistic achievements. For Dominos this represents another technological advancement.\n\nThis is a company that caught on to online ordering, mobile ordering and other technology quicker than other pizza companies. Domino’s even played a hand in the world’s first commercial pizza delivery by drone when its New Zealand franchise completed the task earlier this year with drone company Flirtey.\n\nAlong with Flirtey, a company backed by Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ), competition to Google in its drone ambitions comes from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Amazon Prime Air, which successfully delivered a bag of popcorn and Amazon Fire TV Stick to a customer in the United Kingdom earlier this week, leads the way in drone delivery.\n\nAs mentioned above, several companies have successfully delivered items by drone in test runs. Project Wing was one of these successful companies earlier this year when it delivered Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG ) burritos to students at Virginia Tech University. Alphabet has also been a heavy investor in small private companies in the drone sector. From 2012 to 2016, Alphabet trails only Qualcomm for amount invested in the sector for private funding.\n\nNext Page', ""Alphabet Inc's Google Goes All-In Into Self-Driving with Waymo.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been involved in developing self-driving vehicles since 2009 as part of its [in]famous moonshot projects. The company reported in 2015 that its self-driving cars had logged more than a million driving miles and established an impeccable safety record. But now for the first time, the company has created an independent self-driving car unit and named it Waymo. Waymo will build on self-driving technologies that the company has been developing at its Google X (moonshot) division. Here's why this moonshot could be the next biggest growth driver for Alphabet Inc and GOOGL stock.\n\nSelf-Driving Vehicles Could Go Mainstream Sooner Than You Think\n\nUnlike Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose self-driving car roadmap is anything but an open book, Alphabet has been quite clear about its autonomous car ambitions. The fact that the company is going all-in into self-driving at a time when Apple has begun scaling down Project Titan signals greater confidence by Alphabet in the autonomous car concept.\n\nSelf-driving cars could actually come sooner than many people think. Lack of a proper regulatory framework has been partly to blame for the slow advancement of the self-driving cars concept. Up until recently, a patchwork of regulation in the U.S. and Europe only allowed for testing of self-driving cars in certain states, cities, and towns.\n\nBut recent advancements in the industry could push it forward by several years. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) released new self-driving car regulations in September. Although these are mere guidelines and not rules, they are a clear indication that NHTSA is willing to work with tech to provide tools that make self-driving a reality sooner than the standard 4-8 years that it takes to introduce comprehensive changes.\n\nAlso Read: GOOGL Stock: Is Facebook Inc Really A Threat To Alphabet Inc?\n\nTop on NHTSA's guidelines is safety. Companies that manufacture autonomous vehicles will be required to sign a 15-point safety checklist to pre-certify their vehicles. But the safety of self-driving vehicles is not likely to become a major concern. So far, self-driving cars have proven to be considerably safer than human-driven vehicles. The global safety record of human-driven vehicles across all models is one death for every 60 million driving miles. Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles have logged more than 130 million miles on Autopilot, with only one fatality recorded. Meanwhile, Alphabet's autonomous cars have logged a couple of million miles but with only a dozen or so minor accidents with no serious injuries or fatalities yet. Alphabet's impeccable safety record can partly be chalked up to the fact that it's self-driving cars have a speed limit of 25 miles per hour.\n\nSelf-Driving Can Disrupt The Private Automobile Market\n\nUltimately it's not very likely that the superior safety record of autonomous vehicles is going to change for the worse. As people become increasingly comfortable about hitching a ride in driverless cars, self-driving technology will likely disrupt the private automobile market.\n\nAlphabet will use Waymo to explore opportunities in personal vehicles, public transportation, logistics, and ride sharing. Alphabet is, in fact, one of the foremost companies in the autonomous driving field, and graduation of the project into a targeted revenue generating enterprise is a big positive for Google X and GOOGL stock. But perhaps nowhere is the opportunity for self-driving car greater than in the burgeoning shared mobility market, one that is championed by the likes of Uber and Lyft.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, cars will drive 19.6 billion miles globally in 2030, almost double the 10.2 billion miles they travelled in 2015. That growth rate is much faster than the estimated production of light vehicles over the same period which will lead to fast growth in the shared mobility industry. Shared cars accounted for just 4% of global miles travelled in 2015, but will account for nearly 30% by 2030.\n\nAlso Read: AAPL Stock vs GOOGL Stock: Better 2017 Pick- Apple Inc. or Alphabet Inc?\n\nAnd, sharing a ride will gradually become cheaper than owning a car. Currently, it costs $0.76/mile for a self-owned car compared to $1.50/mile for a shared ride. But the tables will eventually turn and by 2030 it will cost $0.50/mile for a shared ride compared with $0.75/mile for a private vehicle. Vehicle sharing is seen as the biggest potential market for autonomous vehicles because they remove the human bottlenecks and improve the economics substantially. Morgan Stanley predicts that the shared mobility market will grow to a $2.6-trillion industry by 2030. In a wildly successful scenario, Alphabet might be able to sell as many self-driving cars in 7-8 years as BMW currently does. BMW sold 1.9 million vehicles in 2015. At an ASP of $75k, that would net the company $142.5B, almost triple its current annual revenue. So that's a solid opportunity for Alphabet. Even 20-30% of that would still present a healthy incremental revenue stream for the company.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nIn the recent past, the future of the autonomous vehicle remained unclear due to lack of a proper regulatory framework that would support mass sales of such vehicles. But with NHTSA starting to move quickly to introduce such regulations, the future of the industry looks bright.\n\nAlphabet is amongst the first companies that are fully dedicated to the self-driving car industry. And now with Waymo the company will be in a better position to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the growing shared mobility market. It will probably take 3-4 years before Alphabet can start selling its autonomous vehicles in large enough volumes. But this is ultimately a long-term catalyst for GOOGL stock.\n\nEvaluating winning tech stocks? Check out our top stock picks, which have beaten the NASDAQ by over 112%."", 'Top analyst Victor Anthony at research firm Aegis has come out with a bullish call on shares of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The analyst initiated coverage on GOOGL with a Buy rating and a price target of $980, which implies a potential upside of just under 20% from where the stock is currently trading.\n\nAnthony believes, “Despite Google continuing to benefit from multiple secular tailwinds and management actively repurchasing shares, investors have been reticent to buy into the stock this year due to tough revenue comps and the prospect of margin pressures at the core Google segment. And recently, the Trump impact and FX have been a concern. We see the stock working through these concerns due to growth opportunities in Search as a result of new and enhanced ad formats and AI, continued strength at YouTube, and growth of enterprise cloud computing. The confluence of these should help offset the tough compares and margin pressures from rising traffic acquisitions costs, hardware sales and growth investments.”\n\nIn fact, not only does the analyst dismiss apprehension falling upon Trump and foreign exchange variables and their resultant impact, he sees rapid-fire EPS acceleration bounding from a dip in corporate tax rate as well as a rise in share repurchases, surmising, “if the 60% of Alphabet’s cash domiciled oversees was repatriated and used to aggressively repurchase shares (both subject to several caveats within the Republican tax proposals).”\n\nVictor Anthony has a very good TipRanks score with a 64% success rate and he stands at #67 out of 4,291 analysts. Anthony earns 13.3% in his yearly returns. When recommending GOOGL, Anthony gains 8.7% in average profits on the stock.\n\nTipRanks analytics indicate GOOGL as a Strong Buy. Out of 28 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 26 are bullish on Alphabet stock, 1 remains sidelined, and 1 is bearish on the stock. With a return potential of nearly 19%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $967.50.', 'Analysts from multiple firms raised their price targets for Alphabet stock following last night’s earnings report, causing the stock to rally after investors pushed shares lower right after the print. It seems they’re trying to do damage control after widespread headlines that the company had missed estimates for the bottom line. A change in the company’s accounting procedures apparently is causing some confusion.\n\nAlphabet stock to $1,000: Morgan Stanley\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak raised his target for Alphabet stock to a nice round $1,000 per share. The Google parent company reported adjusted earnings of $9.36 per share, compared to the consensus of $9.64 per share. However, after making further adjustments, Nowak says that the company would have reported $10.05 per share, excluding equipment charges, a one-time tax headwind, and other one-time charges.\n\nHe notes that the amounts of some of these one-time charges are unclear and that it’s not uncommon for Alphabet to income such charges below the line. However, he said based on fundamentals, the result was still better than expected.\n\nAnother key bullish point was that Websites revenue increased 23%, which was more than expected, and adjusted EBIT beat Nowak’s estimate by 9%, excluding some of the other charges he added in. He also spoke to the suggestion that the company’s core margin pressure was worsening, but he doesn’t think this is necessarily the case, even with the introduction of the Pixel phones. Again, this goes back to the one-time charges he includes that Alphabet didn’t.\n\nDeutsche Bank analysts peg Alphabet’s adjusted earnings higher than Nowak, at $10.30 per share after making their own adjustments and factoring in the 4.2% higher tax rate.\n\nAlphabet stock target to $1,050: Stifel\n\nDeutsche Bank analysts peg Alphabet’s adjusted earnings higher than Nowak, at $10.30 per share after making their own adjustments and factoring in the 4.2% higher tax rate.\n\nStifel analyst Scott Devitt boosted his price target for Alphabet stock from $950 to $1,050 per share after last night’s print. He continued the Wall Street narrative that the company actually beat consensus for non-GAAP earnings based on one-time adjustments. He merely described it as “comfortably above the Street if Alphabet has excluded the previously mentioned $320mm in one-time costs.”\n\nAmong the other analysts who boosted their price targets for Alphabet stock is Macquarie’s Ben Schachter, who moved his target from $975 to $995 and pronounced the fourth quarter report “mostly fine, more of the same.” Also Baird analyst Colin Sebastian raised his target for Alphabet stock from $930 to $960. He’s also of the view that the company’s non-GAAP earnings were better than what the headlines suggest and noted “surprisingly strong” revenues from the “Other” segment, which points to momentum in the Cloud, contributions from Play, and early success from the Pixel line, Home hardware products and other inclusions.\n\nAlphabet’s earnings a negative sign for Facebook?\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch analysts also agree with the view that Alphabet’s adjusted earnings should be considered a beat despite the headlines. They note that the company didn’t state what the $320 charge was for and that it said it will no longer exclude stock-based compensation from its non-GAAP earnings, which is a key change.\n\nOn a side note, they’re concerned that Alphabet’s earnings could be a bearish signal for Facebook which suggests that expectations could be too high. The reason is because Google Websites revenue didn’t match their “more bullish channel checks.”\n\nShares of Alphabet stock bounced around during regular trading hours on Friday, plunging before bouncing around midday to trade at around $851.', 'Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google’s messaging app Allo may not be safe anymore. The app is said to be sharing search history with friends, a security hitch that has been linked to a design flaw. The issue was first brought to light by Recode after an attempt by the bot to answer a question using a link from a previous search.\n\nAllo accommodates Google’s Assistant, the company’s most recent edition of its virtual assistant software. The unexpected behavior of Google’s app has caused uneasiness among many people because the previous search could have been something sensitive. However, the tech giant seems to have put the issue to rest.\n\nA response to the concern by Google states, “We were notified about the Assistant in group chats not working as intended. We’ve fixed the issue and appreciate the report.”\n\nAssistant tries to safeguard against sharing private information in Allo\n\nA design flaw has been mentioned frequently as the sole cause of the malfunction. However, this is still under scrutiny and perhaps more testing will be necessary. Apparently, Google’s own Pixel phone and Google Home have had the Assistant feature, which is in competition with the wildly successful Echo from Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nNonetheless, one of its main roles is to safeguard against its user’s information in Allo. That means one can use the messaging app and the Assistant at the same time. For example, chatting with a friend on Allo while searching for a restaurant in a certain area.\n\nDespite its flaw, Google continues to promote it as its primary messaging app\n\nNotably, Google’s apps are tightly bound together and that makes it easy to get information from them, the likes of Maps or Gmail. However, messaging in Allo is totally different from searching on the web.\n\nNevertheless, Google has continued to pitch firmly on it citing that it is a unique business-only solution. This was in favor of Google’s Hangouts that were reinvented recently. The app may be struggling now to become mainstream in messaging but there seems to be much more in terms of privacy setbacks.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet’s stock closed at $865.91 witnessing an increase of $1.33 or 0.15%.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.', 'Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is renaming its Messenger to “Android Messages.”\n\nSource: Samsung\n\nThe company said the move is part of an update that will include a number of changes as an effort to revamp its messaging system. Android Messages gets its name from the fact that the new title reflects the direction in which the company is moving.\n\nGoogle is launching an effort that will make its messaging system similar to the operating system Android. Additionally, the system will allow full support for RCS, as well as the ability to download the Android Messages app directly from the Play Store.\n\nThis is key becomes it allows users to download the app directly instead of having to wait for the manufacturer to issue a software update. Other changes to the Alphabet app include multimedia messages, read receipts, as well as other features that have been part of traditional messaging apps such as WhatsApp.\n\nHere are the Android manufacturers that have agreed to adopt the messaging service: LG, Motorola, Sony, HTC, ZTE, Micromax, Nokia, Archos, BQ, Cherry Mobile, Condor, Fly, General Mobile, Lanix, LeEco, Lava, Kyocera, MyPhone, QMobile, Symphony and Wiko, along with Pixel and Android One devices.\n\nThe overall messaging experience has also been enhanced by Alphabet as you can now access the “Universal Profile,” which your rich text messages will be delivered.\n\nGOOGL stock lost 0.8% Friday, and GOOG shares slipped 0.7%.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace', 'Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ) X wants to create a “Wing Marketplace” for drone deliveries.\n\nThe idea behind the Wing Marketplace is that it will allow customers to place orders and have them delivered in a short period of time. It would cost customers $6 for the drone deliveries. However, Alphabet Inc has been having trouble getting drones ready for deliveries.\n\nAlphabet Inc has had two successful tests delivering goods to non-employee customers. One took place in 2014 with a delivery to an Australian rancher. The other had it delivering burritos to Virginia Tech students and teachers. This test took place in September and deliveries were made from a Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG ) truck only a few hundred feet away.\n\nAlphabet Inc is reportedly in talks with restaurants and retailers about its Wing Marketplace. Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NASDAQ: WFM ) and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE: DPZ ) are among these restaurants. X was also in talks with Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) about the idea, but it wasn’t interested due to certain restrictions, reports The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAlphabet Inc isn’t the only company that wants to use drones for deliveries. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has been making its own progress with drone deliveries. It revealed earlier this this that it wants to deliver packages to customers within half an hour. However, a launch date and delivery prices have not been announced.\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS ) is also looking into drone deliveries. It started conducting its own tests with drone maker CyPhy Works in September. The delivery service has also been using drones inside of its own warehouses for different tasks.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace', 'Last August, Google announced it would change its name to Alphabet, which would effectively be a holding company for Google and its various businesses — YouTube, Android, etc. — as well as Google\'s more outlandish experiments, like its moonshots factory, ""X""; its investment arms; and more.\n\nThe reasons Google provided mainly had to do with clarity for investors. By creating two specific segments of Google, investors and shareholders could separate the strengths of Google — namely, search and ads — from its riskier endeavors, like self-driving cars. Another reason: Larry Page, then Google\'s CEO, wanted to take a backseat in operations in order to focus on his bigger dreams, like the company\'s moonshots in health and energy.\n\nThat\'s all well and good for Page, Sergey Brin, and the various executives at Google and Alphabet. But one year later, if you ask a random person on the street if they know what Alphabet is, they likely wouldn\'t know.\n\nThis Google Trends data, which compares the volume of Google searches for ""Google"" versus ""Alphabet,"" says it all:\n\nAnd that is probably the biggest benefit from the name change: Google\'s more controversial projects, such as its efforts to expand its reach with accident-prone drones and sensitive healthcare technology, no longer have Google\'s name on them. They\'re now owned by Alphabet, an innocent-sounding company you\'ve probably never heard of.\n\nGoogle has wrestled with its public image for years\n\nFor over a decade, Google was the darling of the Internet Age, providing the best search experience, as well as the best online maps and email experiences. Its unofficial motto was ""Don\'t be evil,"" a reminder that while the company manages a ton of personal data, it must never use it for ""evil,"" which would tarnish the important bond of trust Google had with its customers.\n\n(""Don\'t be evil,"" by the way, also created the notion that Google would never do anything perceived as evil, which is a challenging, if not impossible, expectation to live up to.)\n\nToward the end of the 2000s, Google\'s image started to change. A big moment was when Google introduced Android in 2008 — an operating system that looked and felt a lot like Apple\'s iPhone operating system, which was introduced one year before. People found it suspicious that Google developed Android while its CEO, then Eric Schmidt, sat on Apple\'s board of directors during the iPhone\'s development. Making matters worse, Apple\'s late founder, Steve Jobs, called Android ""outright theft"" and vowed to destroy Android, fueling feelings that Google wasn\'t living up to that ""Don\'t be evil"" mantra.\n\nOther instances in recent years where Google came across as creepy:\n\nIn 2010, Google\'s Street View cars were caught eavesdropping on people\'s Wi-Fi connections.\n\nIn 2011, Google agreed to forfeit $500 million after a criminal investigation by the Justice Department found that Google illegally allowed advertisements from online Canadian pharmacies to sell their products in the US.\n\nIn 2012, Google circumvented the no-cookies policy on Apple\'s Safari web browser and paid a $22.5 million fine to the Federal Trade Commission as a result.\n\nAlso in 2012, Google tried to create a single privacy policy for all of its services, which outraged some customers, as they believed this would make it easier to sell data to advertisers.\n\nWhile changing the name from Google to Alphabet and reorganizing Google\'s various properties under Alphabet doesn\'t change the past, it does help prevent similar public relations debacles from happening in the future. Since it\'s technically Google\'s parent company currently working on all of its projects that might be considered ""creepy"" — like drones, self-driving cars, genetic engineering, machine intelligence, or its project to extend the human life span — the name Google is kept out of people\'s mouths and out of the media, to some degree.\n\nAll of this is to say Alphabet and Google are not bad or evil companies just because of this PR shift. If anything, it\'s extremely smart of Page and company to separate Google\'s uncertain experiments from its solid-yet-mundane search and ads business. But the staggering difference in public awareness between Alphabet and Google is worth noting — so if you ever see a news headline about Alphabet, just think ""Google.""', 'Schaller Investment Group Inc. held its position in Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) during the fourth quarter, Holdings Channel reports.

This is a four step process for computing the realized volatility risk. Here we go.Realized volatility using proprietary measures has hit a plunging low level.Even though Alphabet Inc is a legitimate large cap, just the fact that it is a technology company makes GOOGL susceptible to elevated risk due to issues surrounding unrest in the European Union and patent fights as well as an unending need to drive innovation forward through proper research and development.

GOOGL’s self-driving car project, now known as Waymo, is in discussions to bring a second auto heavy-hitter under its belt.\n\nOn Wednesday, Honda made some waves revealing it is in conversation to test Alphabet’s Waymo in assorted cars, exploring use of sensors to computers to software.\n\nThis would mark Waymo’s second strategic partnership, as there already is a collaboration in the making with carmaker Fiat Chrysler, widely anticipated to kick-start a ride-hailing service with self-driving cars by the close of 2017.\n\nJust one week prior, after having been in the Google X research lab for eight years, Alphabet’s self-driving car project realized into an independent, separate company, Waymo, with a priority on selling its technology over building cars.\n\nWorthy of note, the Google-parent company plans to keep under wraps the revenue and profitability of its self-driving tech company, with its financial results to be mixed under a branch titled “Other Bets” with the rest of non-Google businesses.\n\nRuth Porat, GOOGL Chief Financial Officer has advocated for investors to judge Other Bets throughout the course of a “long horizon,” keeping in mind viewing financial results through an “early stage” dose of perspective.\n\nWaymo is adamant in its quest “that there will be more self-driving cars sooner, available from a variety of automakers.” Meanwhile, from Honda’s perspective, “These discussions are an initial step that will allow Waymo and Honda R&D to further explore the potential of a broad range of automated driving technologies.”\n\nThough these discussions are only just the beginning of a potential partnership, clearly both companies are serious enough to make even just initial talks a matter of news-worthy attention. Clearly both Waymo and Honda see it to their favor to make this dialogue public, perhaps to drum up further investor interest.\n\nBrian Fitzgerald of research firm Jefferies for one finds the move encouraging, asserting, “The news supports our expectation that Waymo will be focused on technology with the potential to license to vehicle manufacturers rather than making the cars themselves.”\n\nMoving forward, Waymo outlines the goal that this collaboration ignites future “opportunities to collaborate with Honda to advance fully self-driving technology and make our roads safer,” with hopes to add Honda’s vehicles instilled with GOOGL technology to the existing fleet already under evaluation throughout four U.S. cities.', 'Waymo (Google/Alphabet) & Honda Collaborating On Self-Driving Tech\n\nDecember 25th, 2016 by James Ayre\n\nWaymo, the now independent self-driving vehicle technology arm of Google (well, technically, Alphabet), is now in formal talks with Honda about a potential partnership, according to recent reports.\n\nSuch a partnership would be an addition to Waymo’s already close ties with Fiat-Chrysler — ties which are demonstrated well in the recently revealed self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrids that we reported on last week.\n\nAs far as a partnerships with Honda, it would reportedly function similarly to the one with a Fiat-Chrysler, whereby Waymo supplies self-driving software and sensors to be used in and integrated with Honda vehicles (with the help of engineers from the auto manufacturer).\n\nA press release from Honda notes:\n\nHonda R&D Co., Ltd., the R&D subsidiary of Honda Motor Co., Ltd., announced today that it is entering into formal discussions with Waymo, an independent company of Alphabet Inc., to integrate its self-driving technology with Honda vehicles. This technical collaboration between Honda researchers and Waymo’s self-driving technology team would allow both companies to learn about the integration of Waymo’s fully self-driving sensors, software and computing platform into Honda vehicles.\n\nAs part of the discussion on technical collaboration, Honda could initially provide Waymo with vehicles modified to accommodate Waymo’s self-driving technology. These vehicles would join Waymo’s existing fleet, which are currently being tested across four U.S. cities.\n\nIf both parties agree to enter into a formal agreement, Honda R&D engineers based in Silicon Valley, California and Tochigi, Japan, would work closely with Waymo engineers based in Mountain View, California and Novi, Michigan.\n\nHonda previously announced its intention to put production vehicles with automated driving capabilities on highways sometime around 2020 related to its goal of a collision-free society. In addition to these on-going efforts, this technical collaboration with Waymo could allow Honda R&D to explore a different technological approach to bring fully self-driving technology to market. These discussions are an initial step that will allow Waymo and Honda R&D to further explore the potential of a broad range of automated driving technologies.\n\nAs alluded to above, Waymo recently received the first 100 autonomous Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans developed with Fiat-Chrysler engineers and active testing of the vehicles is now underway. While it’s hard to tell exactly where Waymo’s technology is, the move to independence and the growing partnerships with established auto manufacturers suggests that they probably aren’t far away from the goal of fully autonomous-driving tech.\n\nBuy a cool T-shirt or mug in the CleanTechnica store!\n\n\n\nKeep up to date with all the hottest cleantech news by subscribing to our (free) cleantech daily newsletter or weekly newsletter, or keep an eye on sector-specific news by getting our (also free) solar energy newsletter, electric vehicle newsletter, or wind energy newsletter.\n\n', ""Google's Waymo to show self-driving Pacifica at Detroit auto show\n\nWaymo, Google's new autonomous-technology unit, will debut its self-driving Chrysler Pacifica at the Detroit auto show.\n\nThe minivan, co-developed with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in a plan to deploy a fleet of 100 autonomous vehicles, will be displayed on stage during Waymo CEO John Krafcik's keynote address on Jan. 8, as part of the Automobili-D event happening the day before the North American International Auto Show's media days begin.\n\nIn a tweet Tuesday, Krafcik said he will discuss the vehicle and details of what Waymo has been working on since October 2015, when it completed the first driverless ride on public roads without a steering wheel or brake pedal.\n\nWe'll talk about what we've been up to since completing the world's first truly self-driving trip https://t.co/1M2JJo4EOC #NAIAS — John Krafcik (@johnkrafcik) December 20, 2016\n\nWaymo published photos of the minivans on Monday, adding that it plans to have the vehicles on public roads by 2017.\n\nWaymo was formerly known as Google's self-driving car project, which was spun off as a standalone company under the Alphabet umbrella.\n\n- Automotive News is a Crain Communications Inc. publication.\n\nRelated Links"", ""WRAPUP 1-Fed rate moves could spell end to Asian easing\n\nSINGAPORE, March 16 The long cycle of falling interest rates in Asia could be over after the U.S. Federal Reserve's third rate rise in 15 months was followed quickly by monetary tightening in the world's second-biggest economy, China."", 'Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is known for using the off the shelf materials in designing its data centre hardware instead of purchasing new equipment from the up-to-date IT and Telecom gurus.\n\nA concern for investors in telecom equipment and data centers\n\nThis moves helps Google to enlighten its mobile carries with its networking know-how, a move that should greatly concern investors in telecom equipment and data centers. They include the likes of Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR), NASDAQ listed Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Nokia Corp (ADR) (NASDAQ:NOK). Google made public its intention to collaborate with the likes of SK Telcom a major carrier in South Korea, Bharti Airtel a giant carrier in India among others. Their main motive is to come up with a site where operators can run their network services.\n\nGoogle’s new technology\n\nThe platform will put among others two very new technologies developed by Google using its own infrastructure. They include network functions virtualization (NFV) and software defined network (SDN). SDN works by transferring network intelligence between switches and software based controllers that positions instructions on network traffic movements. This makes it easier to manage the network, easier movement of resources to applications and services on the network among others. NFV works by having software go through commodity servers to take care of functions that have been used over the years by service providers. The result is reduced costs faster launching of services.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nGoogle has the idea of increasing the current efforts to improve the programming interfaces that provide services like Smart Offline that automatically authorizes downloading of clips only when data rates are affordable. Records indicate that big companies are already adopting SDN and NFV and others both of them. By 2016, SDN was put in use on 34% on its network. They hope to improve that by 75% by 2020.\n\nGoogle competitors on the new technology\n\nGoogle is not the only company trying to benefit from SDN/NFV. A number of equipment giants are also interested and are doing what they can to adopt the two. Nokia provides a set of tools for carriers interested in NFV. Cisco too has adopted SDN/NFV to work with its already installed ACI SDN.', 'Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), (NASDAQ:GOOG), is no longer interested in a fiber optic internet cable service. But it does not mean that the company is going to abandon Fiber. Instead of using fiber optic cables, the company is planning to use a wireless technology to spread its high-speed internet to many U.S. cities and metropolitan areas, according to a report from Wired.\n\nAlphabet has halted the expansion of its Fiber internet service. The company is reportedly moving hundreds of employees to other departments at Google. Fiber internet service is being managed by Google Access division.\n\nGoogle Fiber\n\nGoogle Fiber was launched in 2010. It was first introduced to the Kansas City metropolitan area. The service is then expanded to Austin, and Provo, Atlanta, Charlotte, Raleigh–Durham, Nashville, Salt Lake City, and San Antonio.\n\nFiber offers four options, depending on customer’s location: a 100 MB internet option; a 1 GB option; a 100 MB + TV option; and a 1GB + TV option.\n\nAccess recently appointed a new CEO. Greg McCray is a broadband veteran who has been tasked with finding new ways to bring faster—and presumably cheaper—high-speed internet access to the rest of the country.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here\n\nAccess’ restructuring will not affect the places where Fiber is already available, according to the report. The company is still pushing forward with plans to offer Fiber in Nashville, Louisville, and San Antonio.\n\nFiber Future Looks More Wireless\n\nProviding a high-speed internet though the traditional cables-in-the-ground is expensive. And Google is eyeing high-speed wireless internet as a way to bypass more expensive traditional broadband.\n\nLast year, Google bought Webpass, a company that beams high-speed broadband via networks of small antennas. The company has been in business for 13 years and has a large presence in California, as well as in San Diego, Miami, Miami Beach, Coral Gables, Chicago, and Boston. Webpass might allow Fiber to provide the high-speed internet to individual customers by tapping into existing fiber optic infrastructure without having to string new cables along utility poles or dig up people’s yards.\n\nFiber is testing new wireless technologies in Kansas City. It could expand those experiments to other cities as well. Meanwhile, the company petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to open up more of the wireless spectrum that Webpass uses, which could enable Fiber to expand wirelessly much more quickly, according to the Wired report.\n\nAlphabet is still trying to figure out how to be an internet service provider. There is a possibility that the company could one-day resume efforts to bring actual fiber into homes if it can figure out a way that costs a lot less money. But for now, the future of Google’s high-speed internet looks decidedly wireless.\n\n“Google Fiber remains focused on our customers and cities. We want to bring Google Fiber to customers faster, so we’re focused on making deployment more efficient and less intrusive,” Fiber said in a statement.', 'Earlier today we took a look atduring the first quarter of the year, which included three underloved retailers.

In fact, the shares this week lost hold of the round $800 mark, and they may struggle to get it back. Peak open interest currently resides at the January 2017 800-strike call, suggesting the level could emerge as resistance as front-month expiration approaches.\n\n\n\nToday the shares are off 1% at $795.17, and more losses could be ahead. GOOGL has ended only three of the last 10 first-quarter periods in positive territory, with an average return of negative 2% for the quarter over the past decade.\n\nEven after the equity\'s recent slump, however, optimism toward the Google parent runs high. Out of 29 analysts following the stock, all but two recommend buying the shares, and just one recommends selling. Plus, the average 12-month price target is seated deep in never-before-seen territory, at $967. Short interest on GOOGL is also low. After rising nearly 10% in the most recent reporting period, these bearish bets still account for a meager 0.5% of the security\'s total float.\n\nIf there is pessimism toward the blue-chip stock, it resides in the options pits.

Perhaps these recent put buyers are on to something, since it\'s an unusually attractive time to pick up Alphabet Inc\'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) short-term options.\n\nMSFT still has a lead over the broad market, up 12% 2016, after hitting a record high above $64 last week. But the stock has been positive in the first quarter just three times in the last decade, with an average return of negative 1.7% for the period. The shares are down 1% today, at $62.24.\n\nAnalysts are mostly bullish toward MSFT, with 20 out of 26 calling the stock a ""buy"" or better. Short interest is also low, representing just 0.7% of the equity\'s available float. Even options traders have maintained upbeat positions toward the Dow component -- MSFT\'s 50-day call/put volume ratio at the ISE, CBOE, and PHLX is seated in the high 86th percentile of its annual range, at 2.37.\n\n\n\nAnd like GOOGL, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is presenting a compelling opportunity for options buyers. Based on the stock\'s Schaeffer\'s Volatility Index (SVI) of 16% -- lower than 89% of all readings from the last 12 months -- MSFT\'s near-term options should be particularly well-priced, from a volatility perspective.\n\nLet us help you profit from market volatility.

The expectations come after the company failed to showcase the device in the recent hardware events. There was an expectation that the gadget would be released before the current year ends.

This follows the work done with the earlier model of Nexus 6P, which attracted favorable reviews from different sections of the people and analysts, according to the countrycaller.com.\n\nIf rumors and reports are true, Google Nexus 7 would have 4 GB RAM with an internal storage of 64 GB. The device would be powered by Adreno 530 GPU. Aside from this, the company is said to be planning to add a 13 MP camera. This meant that it would be a considerable step-up from its previous model of Nexus 6P.\n\nRead this also: https://stockmarketdaily.co/2016/12/30/what-makes-it-to-believe-apple-inc-nasdaqaapl-could-make-its-iphone-in-india/\n\nSignificantly, Alphabet has stopped producing Nexus 9. This could be interpreted that the search engine giant is ready to proceed with the next model of tablet devices. The company is under tremendous pressure from the rivals, who would also be rolling out their tablets in the upcoming periods.\n\nFor instance, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are planning to launch their next model of tablet devices in 2017. Google witnessed only two percent of new phone connections in the holiday season.

Offering up a rare miss, Alphabet said it earned $9.36 per share versus expectations of $9.63 per share, while revenue arrived at $26.06 billion compared to predictions for $25.22 billion.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGOOGL stock has since fallen more than 5%, and its edging lower once again today.\n\nBut the shares were due for a bit of a selloff, as GOOGL stock was overbought heading into earnings amid an overly enthusiastic sentiment backdrop. Contrarian investors know that this is a recipe for short-term disaster on even the slightest hiccup.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge Now that the knee-jerk selling has about run its course, it’s time to get back to being realistic on GOOGL stock’s prospects. Technically, Alphabet shares remain in a long-term uptrend, supported by its 10-week and 20-week moving averages.\n\nFurthermore, these trendlines completed a bullish cross earlier this month, which could bring bargain hunters to the table once the post-earnings gyrations have subsided.\n\nAs for sentiment, the fourth-quarter earnings blip for GOOGL stock hasn’t shaken the brokerage community one bit. And it shouldn’t. According to Thomson/First Call, all but two of the 48 analysts following Alphabet Inc rate the shares a “buy” or better. Additionally, the 12-month price target of $988.47 represents a modest premium of only about 19% to GOOGL’s Monday close.\n\nWith search ad revenue holding strong and Alphabet expanding its hardware program, we may even see a few upward revisions in the next month or so.\n\nOn the options front, GOOGL Feb./March put/call open interest ratio has risen slightly in the past week to rest at 0.72, with puts gaining a bit of traction in the wake of last week’s quarterly report. For the March series, traders are still eyeing the $860 and $900 strikes, while put traders are focused on $800 and $750.\n\nOverall, March implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 5% in the next two months. Currently, this places the upper bound at $865.02, while the lower bound lies at $782.64 from Monday’s close. I would be surprised to see GOOGL stock trade south of $800, as it would take some unexpectedly poor news from Alphabet or a significant turn in the overall market. A rally to $860 seems more likely, though resistance at $850 could be a stumbling block.\n\n2 Trades for GOOGL Stock\n\nPut Sell: The safest route to profit on GOOGL stock right now would be to bank on technical support and sell option premium. Right now, the March $800 put looks like a solid bet for such a play. At last check, this put was bid at $12, or $1,200 per contract.\n\nAs usual, you keep the premium as long as GOOGL stock closes above $800 when these options expire. The downside is that should Alphabet trade below $800 ahead of March expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $800 per share.\n\nCall Spread: If you are more bullish on GOOGL stock’s prospects, then a March $830/$850 bull call spread has potential At last check, this spread was offered at $8, or $800 per pair of contracts.\n\nBreakeven lies at $838.00, while a maximum profit of $12, or $1,200 per pair of contracts, is possible if Alphabet closes at or above $850 when March options expire.\n\nAs of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace', 'Alphabet Inc missed Q4 earnings estimates. Is GOOGL stock still a good long-term buy?\n\n\n\nFlickr\n\nGoogle\'s parent company Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) missed analyst estimates in its Q4-2016 earnings report leading to a slight fall in GOOGL stock. GOOGL stock is down by a little over 4% since its earnings release. The holding company that owns Google delivered an EPS of $9.36 on revenues of $26.1B. Alphabet\'s fourth quarter earnings suggest that Google\'s double-digit growth is sustainable for several quarters to come. Alphabet Inc missed earnings estimates by a fair distance (by $0.27), but posted a strong revenue growth of 22% YoY and 16% QoQ. While Alphabet\'s core business continues to deliver, this quarter also saw much better results in the \'Other Bets\' segment. The other bets segment posted a revenue of $262M, much higher than $152M in the fourth quarter a year ago. The earnings miss may not have gone down well with investors, but the question is, is GOOGL stock is on course to breach the $1000 mark? Should you be buying GOOGL stock after the earnings miss?\n\nIs Alphabet\'s Earnings Miss A Cause For Concern?\n\nAlphabet\'s Q4 earnings report included a one-time charge of $320M which reduced the company’s gross profit margin. Alphabet CFO, Ruth Porat mentioned in the earnings call that the charge was for ""equipment"", and also confirmed it was not for any ""hardware"" related to company\'s Pixel phone. This one-time charge remains a mystery for everyone, and had it not been for this one-time charge, Alphabet would have beaten the Street\'s earning estimates. Most analysts say that they have no idea about the charge and agree that excluding it Alphabet would have delivered an earnings beat. In a recent Barrons post, Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley opined that\n\n""By our math GOOGL’s 4Q:16 adjusted EPS would have been $10.05 excluding a $320mn charge in COGS related to equipment and a series of other adjustments and an estimated ~320bp tax headwind from one-time charges related to geographic mix and discrete US items. This implies that GOOGL would have beaten our/Consensus adj EPS by 7%/4% excluding these items. Bears may counter that we don’t know what the equipment and other charges are (they’re right) and that GOOGL very often has one-time items below the line (right again) but from a pure fundamental and recurring earnings power perspective, 4Q:16 results were materially better than expected""\n\nHe also has an ""Overweight"" rating on Alphabet stock. All this suggests that one should not read too much into the earnings miss. Fundamentally Alphabet\'s core business is on track. Though total TAC is up, rising to $4.848B from $4.055B in the fourth quarter year ago, total paid clicks growth at 36%YoY, should soothe investors\' concerns.\n\nSearch Alone Is A Big Reason To Buy GOOGL Stock\n\nOne cannot think of using the internet without using search engines at some stage or the other. Alphabet\'s search engine Google is by far the best you can get. Google\'s search algorithm is not only the most sophisticated but also the best money spinning search engine. Lion\'s share of Alphabet\'s total revenue comes from search-based advertising. Alphabet\'s Google segment delivered an operating income of $7.9B, up from $6.7B in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAlphabet CFO, Ruth Porat is of the view that Google\'s core search business has still not hit top gear and can still scale further. In the earnings call, she emphasized on this fact, stating that:\n\n""This performance is a testament to the ongoing innovation that is driving our success in mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising, each of which we believe has only begun to scratch the surface. We remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped.""\n\nAlso, a Barron\'s post suggests that Alphabet is set to gain big in its search advertising business, due to the shift in consumer spending to e-commerce platforms. This will lead to increased digital ad spending, of which Google could continue to capture outsized incremental share. Google is leaving no stone unturned to dominate the booming mobile digital ad market by announcing some new strategic partnerships in the mobile space recently.\n\nGoogle Could Take A Bite Of AWS And Microsoft\'s Cloud Share\n\nIt is very well known that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continue to ride on the cloud growth wave. Google, which has a meager 5% market share in the cloud market, is slowly catching up. In the Q4-2017 earnings call, Google CEO, Sundar Pichai announced that ""more than 3 million paying businesses are now using G Suite to collaborate smartly and securely in the cloud."" A TechCrunch post reports that a similar announcement was last made in November 2015 highlighting the progress Google is making on the cloud front. AWS and Microsoft are marked to gain big in 2017 due to the growing cloud market worldwide. Google can still take a bite out of these two big players\' share with its products gaining traction among enterprise customers. Mr. Pichai attributed ""Google’s ability to provide its users with a highly secure platform "" as the reason for the growing popularity of the company\'s cloud offerings among enterprises. Mr. Pichai also considered cloud as one of their biggest bets. So, investors should watch out for more information on this front.\n\nSumming It Up\n\nThere is still a strong bullish sentiment around GOOGL stock among the analyst community even after its earnings miss. With Google\'s other bets showing substantial improvement in the last quarter\'s results, even one decent success from any of its moonshots could propel GOOGL stock higher in the future. Alphabet\'s strengthening core business prospects presents one with ample confidence to keep holding the stock. Alphabet\'s advertising business is set to continue its double-digit growth in 2017 as well. Investors should try to build a position in GOOGL stock, buying the stock on dips. A large number of analysts have a price target of $1000 and above which doesn\'t look improbable. Alphabet Inc is still very much a good long-term investment that\'s worth considering.\n\nLooking for great tech stocks? Check out our top technology stock picks, which have beaten the NASDAQ by over 120%.', ""Digital advertising is expected to surpass television advertising in the U.S. this year -- that is, if it hasn't already. The two main beneficiaries of the growth in digital advertising are Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which owns Google.\n\nIndeed, the two companies completely dominate the digital advertising market, combining to take about 60% of the market. Both companies are growing rapidly, especially considering their size, but which is the better buy right now?\n\nA look at valuation\n\nBoth Facebook and Alphabet trade for relatively high valuations, which would leave them off the buy list of many investors. But both companies arguably deserve their high valuations because of their rapid growth and the industry trend supporting them.\n\nCompany P/E (forward) P/S (TTM) P/FCF (TTM) PEG Facebook 24.9 15.2 43.2 0.95 Alphabet 20.0 6.8 24.8 1.06\n\nInvestors are valuing Facebook's expected earnings and earnings growth near the same levels as Alphabet, but that puts a premium on Facebook's trailing-12-month sales and free cash flow compared to Alphabet's.\n\nFacebook does sport a significantly larger operating margin compared with Alphabet (45%, versus 26% in the third quarter), which makes its sales more valuable, but no more than twice as valuable. Likewise, Facebook's free cash flow doesn't deserve to be given nearly twice the value as Alphabet's.\n\nFor investors looking for a growth stock with a good valuation, Alphabet shares definitely take the title here.\n\nWhat about growth?\n\nA great growth stock, however, will produce significant earnings growth for its shareholders. You'll notice the one valuation where Facebook outshines Alphabet (albeit just barely) is in its PEG ratio -- the only metric shown that accounts for growth.\n\nIndeed, analysts expect Facebook to continue growing rapidly over the next five years, with a compound annual earnings growth rate of 35.5%. Analysts expect Alphabet to produce EPS growth of just 18.6% on average through 2021. That's nearly half the rate of Facebook's growth -- and that's what you get for the premium price you'll pay for Facebook.\n\nFacebook's management recently warned that advertising revenue growth on its flagship platform will slow about midway through 2017, but it still has several other major potential revenue drivers.\n\nInstagram is still in the early days of advertising, and analysts at Credit Suisse estimate it could generate $6.4 billion in 2017 (double 2016) and $12 billion by 2021. For reference, Facebook is expected to produce $27.3 billion in sales this year.\n\nFacebook's Oculus just started selling hardware a bit over a year ago, and Mark Zuckerberg expects VR to be the next big computing platform. Not to mention Facebook has 1 billion users for both Messenger and WhatsApp left to monetize.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's growth will come mainly from the continued trend of growing digital advertising spend, which largely benefits Google. YouTube may also help drive revenue growth, but it's a much more mature advertising platform compared to Instagram and carries lower margins than Google's main ad products. While the company has several moonshots that could turn out to be huge profit machines in the future, even Alphabet's small wins are dwarfed by the size of Google.\n\nFor investors looking for a growth stock with the most potential for growth, Facebook is a better buy than Alphabet."", 'Alphabet Inc.

For the bulls, a second attempt on the price chart looks worthy of a little of our attention on GOOG stock.\n\nDespite uncertainties ranging from net neutrality, skilled labor immigration policies and potentially bearish China trade relations tied to the incoming Trump administration, GOOG stock is showing its wherewithal.\n\nThe “What ifs” are daunting. Not just for Alphabet Inc, but for other large-cap tech outfits such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) or the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Silicon Valley would be on the butt end of Trump’s pro-business platform if his policies are actually pursued and ultimately implemented.\n\nRegarding China, the impact of trade restrictions could be particularly hurtful for GOOG stock. Following the company’s difficult exit from China in 2010, Alphabet Inc is back and aiming to be a player in the second largest economy’s mobile market with Google Play and its new Pixel phone.\n\nOn the plus side, other Trump pledges regarding the repatriation of overseas cash hordes and cutting corporate tax rates are not only favorable for GOOG stock, but also more likely to gain passage through Congress without much effort.\n\nPlus, if investors just look at GOOG’s stock chart, rather than the bluster of potential threats, you’ll see that things look pretty good.\n\nGOOG Stock Chart\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge It hasn’t always been pretty, but Alphabet’s price action has at least been constructive.\n\nDuring the first half of 2016, GOOG established a large corrective double bottom. That’s typically a welcome event for bulls because it unwinds excessive behavior. The technical reset then went on to forge a breakout attempt in October.\n\nUnfortunately, the move to fresh all-time highs proved short-lived. Alphabet’s rally reversed, then winded up failing.\n\nNext Page', 'Elastic Weight Consolidation or EWC computes how important each connection in a neural network is to the task it has just learned and then assigns this connection a mathematical weight proportional to its importance. ( Source: DeepMind) Elastic Weight Consolidation or EWC computes how important each connection in a neural network is to the task it has just learned and then assigns this connection a mathematical weight proportional to its importance. ( Source: DeepMind)\n\nDeepMind, the London-based artificial intelligence company owned by Alphabet Inc., claims it overcame a key limitation affecting one of the most promising machine learning technologies: the software’s inability to remember.\n\nThe breakthrough, described in a paper published Tuesday in the academic journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, may open the way for artificial intelligence systems to be more easily applied to multiple tasks, instead of being narrowly trained for one purpose. It should also improve the ability of AI systems to transfer knowledge between tasks and to master a sequence of linked steps.\n\nWatch all our videos from Express Technology\n\nNeural networks, software which is loosely based on the structure of synapses in the human brain, are considered the best machine learning technique for language translation, image classification and image generation. But these networks suffer from a major flaw scientists call “catastrophic forgetting.” They exist in a kind of perpetual present: every time the network is given new data, it overwrites what it has previously learned.\n\nIn human brains, neuroscientists believe that one way in which memory works is that connections between neurons that seem important for a particular skill become less likely to be rewired. The DeepMind researchers drew on this theory, known as synaptic consolidation, to create a way to allow neural networks to remember. They worked with Claudia Clopath, a neuroscientist at London’s Imperial College, who is a co-author on the paper. “We have shown it is possible to train a neural network sequentially, which was previously thought to be a fundamental limitation,” James Kirkpatrick, a DeepMind researcher who was the lead author on the paper, said in an interview.\n\nThe researchers created an algorithm, called Elastic Weight Consolidation or EWC that computes how important each connection in a neural network is to the task it has just learned and then assigns this connection a mathematical weight proportional to its importance. The weight slows down the rate at which the value of that particular node in the neural network can be altered. In this way, the network is able to retain knowledge while learning a new task.\n\nThe researchers tested the algorithm on ten classic Atari games, which the neural network had to learn to play from scratch. DeepMind had previously created an AI agent able to play these games as well or better than any human player. But that earlier AI could only learn one game at a time. If it was later shown one of the first games it learned, it had to start all over again. The new EWC-enabled software was able to learn all ten games and, on average, come close to human-level performance on all of them. It did not, however, perform as well as a neural network trained specifically for just one game, the researchers wrote.\n\nAlso Read: Alphabet’s DeepMind is exploring why robots could end up killing\n\nPeter Dayan, a professor of neuroscience at University College London, said DeepMind’s paper might benefit neuroscientists in thinking about how synaptic consolidation works. He said studies by psychologist John Pearce, at Cardiff University, seemed to indicate a very similar mechanism determined which synapses were available or unavailable for new learning.\n\nDeepMind, which Alphabet purchased for 400 million pounds ($486.4 million) in 2014, is best known for having created AI software able to beat the world’s best players at the ancient Asian strategy game Go. That achievement was considered a major milestone in computer science because Go has so many possible moves that a computer cannot simply figure out the best move in every situation and instead must rely on something more akin to intuition – making educated guesses based on its own experience.\n\nFor all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now', 'Stocks To Watch: Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Under Armour Inc (NYSE:UAA), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C), Kate Spade & Co (NYSE:KATE) And Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

In the latest indicator of the importance of India as a market to American tech giants, Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Allo messaging app now supports Hindi.\n\nSource: Google\n\nThe market for the consumer products that big technology companies like Google and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) sell is becoming saturated in North America. There are only so many Android phones and and iPhones you can sell here, especially when almost everyone already owns one.\n\nChina or India?\n\nA mature market means the days of record-setting sales quarters are ending.\n\nThats why countries like China and India are looked to for growth. Their populations dwarf that of North America and there’s a growing demand for smartphones.\n\nChina has often been considered the prize. Its population of 1.357 billion is over four times that of the U.S. and wealth has been rapidly building in the country — along with a demand for high-tech gadgets.\n\nHowever, China is a tough nut to crack. It’s home to many competing technology firms like Xiaomi and Oppo that are selling home-grown smartphones at a fraction of the price of an iPhone. The government and its strict policies (including censorship) can be difficult to deal with, as companies from Google to Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) have discovered.\n\nGiven the challenges in China, India has become an increasingly attractive market.\n\nWith a population of 1.25 billion, it is nearly as large as China. Like China, India has a growing economy and an expanding middle class, but India is a decade or more behind China in its econonomic development. So moving on India now means getting in early, unlike China which requires considerable effort to establish a presence.\n\nIn addition, India’s government is seen as being easier to deal with by Western technology companies and India lacks the powerhouse local technology companies that have been taking over the Chinese smartphone market.\n\nGoogle Allo Goes Hindi\n\nThere’s no Chinese version, but Google is now rolling out Hindi support in its Allo messaging app, in a clear nod to the importance it places on the Indian market. As Ars Technica points out, this is just the latest in a series of India firsts for the company.\n\nNext Page', 'Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is reportedly selling its Terra Bella Imaging satellite business to Planet Labs, one of Terra Bella’s fiercest competitors. For the past year, Alphabet has outperformed the Zacks Internet-Services industry. GOOGL has returned 12.68% compared with the industry’s return of 11.89%.\n\nBloomberg reported on Monday that the sale is likely an equity transaction with Alphabet keeping a stake in Planet Labs.\n\nFormerly known as Skybox, the earth imaging company was founded in 2009 and the search giant bought it for $500 million in 2014, the same year when Skybox was named no. 1 on Inc. magazine’s 25 Most Audacious Companies.\n\nGetting Rid of Audacious Ventures\n\nThe move underscores Alphabet’s efforts to trim relatively less-revenue generating businesses and attain financial discipline.\n\nIn Aug 2015, Alphabet reportedly curbed expansion of its high-speed fiber optic Internet network, cutting 9% of its staff. In November, the company scaled back Project Wing, its experimental drone delivery program.\n\nWhat’s on Planet’s Platter?\n\nPrivately held Planet operates with dozens of small satellites that take pictures of the Earth surface frequently. However, the resolution of the images is low. Terra Bella has larger satellites with high image resolution but its fleet contains only seven satellites, which limits the frequency of capturing images.\n\nThus, we believe that through this acquisition, Planet Labs will add high resolution satellites to its fleet. Both companies share the satellite imaging space with giants like Airbus’ (OTCMKTS: EADSY ) Airbus Defence & Space and DigitalGlobe Inc (NYSE: DGI ).\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nAlphabet’s sales, marketing and R&D expenses have gone up considerably in the last five years. There are also some other margin pressures. The most significant at the moment is related to currency, which continued to impact Alphabet’s results despite the fact that it has a hedging program in place.\n\nAlphabet Inc. EPS Diluted (TTM)\n\nOther expense pressures include fast-paced international growth, a growing volume of lower-priced YouTube clicks and strength of the mobile platform. So we believe that Alphabet has foreseen an escalation of costs in the years to come and is gearing up well in advance with decisions like these.\n\nNext Page', 'Shares of Alphabet Inc.

Although, the firm notes there also was a 15% dip in click-through-rates.\n\nFrom Anthony’s standpoint, “The CTR decline was attributed to the jump in impression growth. Mobile was the key driver with spend increasing 69% YoY, desktop increasing 5%, while tablet spend declined 28% YoY (bid modifier effect). The retail and finance verticals were very strong while travel was flat and education spend was down YoY. IgnitionOne is expecting healthy growth in search in 2017.”\n\nOverall, “Both IgnitionOne and RKG reported accelerating growth in search spend in 4Q16, suggesting that Google search growth is very strong this quarter. Add to that, strong growth at YouTube given that app tracking data show a sharp jump in MAUs in 4Q (see our last GOOGL note for details), we see Alphabet reporting strong FX-neutral results,” Anthony concludes.\n\nFollowing the conference call, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on GOOGL with a price target of $980, which represents a 21% increase from where the shares last closed.\n\nVictor Anthony has a very good TipRanks score with a 63% success rate and he stands at #78 out of 4,289 analysts.

Many claim that it is one of the hardest languages to learn period, and true to the word, even Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has not been able to crack it. However, the tech giant has seen some progress in cracking the tough language. It has made Japanese one of the languages that can be used in Word Lens.\n\nThe feature, which will be available in the Google Translate app will allow people to interact with an instant translator from their phones. It is particularly useful for travelers hence it will come in handy for the 20 million tourists who visit Japan annually. Apparently, it will not ask for Internet or data connectivity.\n\nOn its blog post, Google wrote, “With Word Lens now available in Japanese, you’ll never have to worry about taking a wrong turn on a busy Shibuya street or ordering something you wouldn’t normally eat.”\n\nThe Word Lens allows instant translation via the camera\n\nAll translations are performed on the mobile device and through the camera, which is able to recognize text overlaid in its live view say by another selected by the user. Initially, the app was only able to translate Japanese to English but on first taking a photograph and highlighting text areas that require translation. Thus this must be a significant milestone for Google, which is being fulfilled two years after the introduction of the feature. Notably, within the two years, it has added no less than 27 languages including Lithuanian, Finnish, and Thai.\n\nBut the feature is meant for brief phrases and words\n\nWord Lens, which was originally its own standalone app before being acquired by Google through its developer Quest Visual will not work well with long sentences or phrases. A long passage of text translation will not have accuracy. Hence the use of brief phrases and words is highly recommended.

After all, GOOGL had stolen many plays from Apple Inc.‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) playbook. Just like Apple, the company came to the fray with the Google Pixel and the Google Pixel XL with screen sizes of 5 inches and 5.5 inches, respectively.\n\nSource: Google\n\nBut Google was not content to just copy a few iPhone moves. The marketing strategies employed by the two companies are remarkably similar:\n\nBoth lay claim to being the smartest smartphones on the planet,\n\nBoth claim to have the best cameras in their class,\n\nBoth sport rather humdrum designs that are nevertheless pretty impressive par the course nowadays and,\n\nBoth are pretty darn expensive, with the unlocked base 32GB versions starting and $649 for both smartphones.\n\nGOOGL though has one-upped Apple by adding a touch of exclusivity to the Pixel to differentiate it from other Android phones. This includes special features such as a Pixel Launcher, Google Assistant and Daydream. By now, you might be wondering — what kind of affect does this have on GOOGL stock?\n\nNot so Fast, Google Pixel\n\nNot surprisingly, Google Pixel hit the ground running. Many GOOGL stock investors were willing to bet that the company’s first smartphone ever was on track to knock Apple down a peg or two after years of dominance in the smartphone business. Pixel managed to garner many glowing reviews, with The Verge declaring it ‘‘hit a homerun,” while Ars Technica described it as the ”best Android smartphone ever.”\n\nBut current indications are that the victory dance was a bit premature. Some numbers coming from Wall Street suggest that Pixel is unlikely to live up to the iPhone-killer hype. Morgan Stanley has come up with estimates that Google will sell a respectable 3 million Pixels worth $2 billion during the final three months of 2016, but only 5 million to 6 million for the whole of 2017 once the initial enthusiasm wears off.\n\nComparatively, Apple sold 212 million iPhone units in fiscal year 2016 netting $137 billion in revenue. Further, Apple averaged 41% gross margin for the iPhone in 2016, almost double the 22% to 25% range analysts are modeling for the Pixel depending on the configuration. So what Pixel will add to Google’s top and bottom lines really is a drop in the bucket compared with the iPhone, a device that brings in 60% of total Apple revenues.\n\nBut these disappointing projections should probably not come as a surprise to GOOGL stock owners. Most smartphone users tend to be very loyal to their brands, and the next handsets they buy are largely dictated by past purchases.\n\nClose to 90% of consumers that currently own an iPhone are likely to stick to the Apple ecosystem; ditto for the Android camp. Moreover, asking the average Android smartphone user to upgrade to a Pixel is going to be a tough sell. The Android smartphone average selling price hovers around $250, less than half the price of an entry-level Pixel.\n\nNext Page', 'Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) faces the risk of losing all current and future government contracts having been sued by the department of labor as part of an anti-discrimination audit. The department in its lawsuit is seeking to compel the tech giant to hand over compensation data as part of a compliance evaluation.\n\nGoogle’s Privacy Concerns\n\nIn the lawsuit, the Department accuses the search giant of failing to hand over requested data and documents pertaining to compensation as requested by the office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. The agency had sought data regarding the company’s equal opportunity program as early as September 2015.\n\n“Despite many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily, Google has refused to do so. We filed this lawsuit so we can obtain the information we need to complete our evaluation,” said OFCCP Acting Director Thomas M. Dowd.\n\nGoogle in its defense insists it has turned down over hundreds of thousands of documents to the department as part of its commitment to people’s privacy. The tech giant goes on to claim that handing over some of the documents requested by the agency will reveal confidential data, something it is not willing to do.\n\nDiversity Concerns\n\nGoogle, one of the biggest Federal contractors, is required by law to permit the federal government to inspect and copy records of its compliance with equal opportunity. The law prohibits such contractors from discriminating in hiring based on applicant’s race, color, religion, sex, or sexual orientation. Why Google would discriminate by anything other than talent and productivity is an open question.\n\nThe tech giant handing over the required documents is expected to shed more light on its hiring practices as well as the composition of its workforce, though it is unclear how the composition of its workforce would constitute evidence of discrimination based on anything other than talent and productivity.\n\nJust like other tech companies where men occupy a good number of high-ranking position, Google continues to grapple with diversity concerns, something that the labor department wants to crack down on, as they hold that if the numbers are not exactly equal in proportion to population, discrimination based on something other than productivity must be taking place. The same is part of an effort that seeks to enforce equal employment opportunities regardless of one’s race, gender, or sexual orientation. It is unclear how this effort helps either those supposedly discriminated against, or Google.\n\nGoogle stock was unchanged in Wednesday trading session having shed $0.24 to close the session at $807.77 a share.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.', ""Legal hassles continue for Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL Google as it faces a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Labor.

(GOOGL) has been on a tear of late — much like the rest of the market. The stock’s market cap has topped half a trillion dollars and may well be on its way to becoming the first trillion dollar company if its foray into self-driving cars with Waymo, and its Cloud computing businesses take off.\n\nBut, while the stock has risen to new heights, it’s reasonable to look for an option strategy that benefits if the stock simply doesn’t “go down that much.” That is, it’s semi-bullish, but really just “not bearish.”\n\nIt turns out there is such a strategy — and it’s been very profitable.\n\nRisk Controls and Beating the Market\n\nWe can take a rather simple and fast look at Alphabet Inc (GOOGL). Let’s just test a simple idea: Selling out of the money put spreads every 30-days. Here are the results:\n\nView photos\n\nWe can see a rather large 102% to 128% return depending on the exact put spreads we sold. And, of course, to make this relevant, we need the perspective of the stock performance during the last three-years. Here is the chart that plots the short put spreads in the yellow highlighted lines and the stock price in the gray line:\n\nView photos\n\nWe’re looking at option strategies that essentially benefited from Alphabet not having any ‘black swan’ stock drops to return over 100% while the stock rose ‘just’ 43%. We find similar results with Apple (AAPL), IBM, Qualcomm (QCOM) and even the S&P 500 (SPY).\n\nWhat Just Happened\n\nThis is how people profit from the option market — it’s preparation, not luck.

Indoor location solutions are currently being rolled out in retail stores to help customers find products, in malls to help customers find stores and help friends find each other, in airports to help travelers find their gates, and much more.\n\nThe Waze Beacons are the first time that indoor location technology is being used commercially to help automobile navigation in GPS-deprived places. The beacons transmit unique identifying data that the Waze app, running on phones in cars, receives and uses to estimate location. The beacons do not receive any data; all the calculation happens on the phones. The beacon signals can also, in principle, be received and utilized by other apps.\n\nWith GPS signals unavailable in tunnels, navigation applications and devices in cars cannot update their location as they move through the tunnels. In tunnels that include exits and turns, such as Boston's Central Artery and Chicago's Lower Loop, the GPS systems will be unable to navigate drivers through the turns. Even in tunnels that just go from point A to point B, such as New York's Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the lack of updated location positioning means that apps cannot warn you about turns you need to make immediately after leaving the tunnel. This is the problem that Waze engineer Gil Disatnik set out to solve. The result was Waze Beacons.\n\nRegular Wi-Fi access points and Bluetooth beacons were not up to the task of moving cars. One challenge related to the speed of moving cars. Bluetooth beacon signals are generally received with a delay of 1-2 seconds, if not more. This may not be a problem while walking around a mall or an airport, but in 2 seconds a car moving at 55 mph (90 kmh) will travel 50 meters, which is 10 meters more than the 40 meter range that most Bluetooth devices deliver. This means that before a smartphone in a car is able to read a Bluetooth signal, it will move out of range and have to start processing the next beacon's signal.\n\nAnother set of challenges revolved around mounting beacons on tunnel walls. First, the beacons had to be strong enough not to be damaged by tunnel cleaners or flying objects. Second, concrete tunnel walls reflect Bluetooth signals and de-tune the antenna, sending the signal back to the transmitter and interfering with the signals.\n\nThese problems were solved by Waze in partnership with their partner in the project, beacon maker Bluvision (recently acquired by HID Global), which created a customized patch antenna with a large ground plane, which can transmit towards the cars without interference from the tunnel walls.\n\nThe Waze team also worked hard on having the beacons be easy to install. Requiring a tunnel to be closed for installation and maintenance would not be effective for rollout. The solution to this problem involved reducing the physical installation time to one minute per beacon. They also reduced configuration time by crowdsourcing configuration through Waze apps driving by.\n\nThe resulting system enables Waze to monitor car locations in tunnels to an accuracy of 13 meters, roughly the distance a car travels in half a second at 55 mph. They did this by simplifying the location positioning problem to a one dimensional one. This is certainly accurate enough for Waze to give navigation instructions effectively. The beacons should operate for up to 6 years without maintenance.\n\nWaze is not saying much about their rollout of Waze beacons in tunnels worldwide, but discussions with city governments and other government authorities are underway. Waze is working with governments and other tunnel owners to market the new capabilities. Grizzly Analytics reports almost 200 companies working on technology for location positioning in GPS-less environments, and the Waze beacons are the first to address the practical issues presented by cars driving in tunnels in a practical solution.\n\nWhat other in-tunnel uses can Waze Beacons have? One likely possibility is self-driving cars, based on Google's or other's R&D, which integrate several technologies for location positioning both on ground and underground. If deployed widely, Waze Beacons could give self-driving cars a strong corroborating source of location data.\n\nWhat will be next? Now that Waze has beacons that can be effectively installed in tunnels and other underground places, where else can they be installed usefully? Unfortunately, the Waze team isn't talking. But it is easy to see how useful beacons could be in underground parking, underpasses, GPS-challenged areas of big cities, and other areas where GPS signals are not available. In underground parking garages, Waze Beacons could enable car-finding applications, as well as enabling Waze to start routing before reaching the garage exit.\n\nBluetooth also has an advantage of being much lower power consumption on the phone than GPS. Over time, if beacons are installed in above-ground public areas, the same technology that works inside tunnels can enable Waze (or Google Maps or other apps) to offer location services with less power usage than GPS currently requires.\n\nMore esoterically, I believe that Waze beacons are another step in the direction of Google establishing ownership over the complete information chain. Waze is an independent subsidiary of Google, but the ownership is Google's. GPS signals are public, and Waze Beacon signals can be read by anyone, but Waze beacons will give Google ownership of information that will be theirs even as they choose to share.\n\nGoogle has been very adept at leveraging their control of information all along the chain. It would presumably not be hard for Android to use Waze Beacons to provide location positioning to all Android apps while cars are underground.\n\nDoes this effect Google's competition with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)? Apple has purchased several indoor location companies in recent years, two of which gave them technology for self-learning GPS-less location positioning, one based on Bluetooth and one on visual data. But Apple is not competing in the area of navigation applications.\n\nFor the public, Waze beacons are going to be great, extending the reach of mapping and navigation applications. Time will tell what other applications Google has for this technology, and what the technology will enable next. Whatever that is, Google will own it."", ""Is this the most-underappreciated stock in tech?\n\nBarron's thinks Google's stock can reach the $1,000 mark on the strength of its digital advertising, YouTube and cloud services.\n\nUpdate: Investors really like Google.\n\nBuy Google - this may be the most under-appreciated stock in tech - 66.1% Hold Google - shares are climbing higher - 31.8% Sell Google - disappointment awaits shareholders - 2.1%\n\nThanks to everyone who participated in today's poll.

The average analysts gave this company a mean recommendation of 1.90 .', 'From Tony Daltorio : One of the big draws at the recent annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas was the automakers showing off their latest driverless car technologies.\n\nBehind all the hoopla, however, was one inescapable fact . . .\n\nCarlos Ghosn, the CEO of Renault (OTC:RNLSY) and Nissan (OTC:NSANY), put it best: “There are still some problems to be solved.” He believes it will be two or three years before the technology is advanced enough for those vehicles to operate safely on the roads.\n\nGhosn was talking about level 3 vehicles according to a classification system devised by the Society of Automotive Engineers. Level 4 and level 5 automated vehicles are even further out. For a look at the SAE’s levels of driving automation, see the graphic below.\n\nA level 3 car designed for drivers to take their hands off the wheel and eyes off the road – for extended periods of time – is promised by Audi (owned by Volkswagen) to be out later in 2017.\n\nBut what about vehicles from Silicon Valley?\n\nWaymo: Ahead of Rivals\n\n\n\nThe foremost player here is Waymo, the autonomous car company owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nAt the recent annual Detroit Auto Show, Waymo revealed it had built all of its self-driving sensor hardware itself. This puts the company ahead of rivals such as Uber in the race to perfect driverless vehicle technology.\n\nJohn Krafcik, the CEO of Waymo, said this signaled an “inflection point” for the company,as this will dramatically reduce the cost (possibly up to 90%) of its autonomous vehicles. That is certainly an important step in the move toward commercialization of such vehicles.\n\nKrafcik added that building the hardware and software together was crucial in improving accuracy. Or in other words, safety.\n\nThis is not good news for all the auto parts providers that were looking to cash in on autonomous vehicles. This includes the likes of Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) and Delphi Automotive (NYSE: DLPH).\n\nIt’s a win-win scenario. Alphabet won’t have to get into car making business and automakers could just plug in Waymo technology into its vehicles without spending a penny for the platform’s development.\n\nSmart Moves by Waymo\n\n\n\nThere is one other reason I like Waymo’s approach to autonomous vehicles.\n\nIt says that its vehicles will be unplugged from the internet for the majority of time, lowering the chances of these vehicles being hacked.\n\nCEO Krafcik told the Financial Times, “Our cars communicate with the outside world only when they need to, so there isn’t a continuous line that’s able to be hacked, going into the car.”\n\nHacking risks rise as more and more sophisticated and connected technology is put into our cars. Once hackers get in via an internet connection – such as a connected radio – they can then take control of critical functions like steering or braking.\n\nOver the past few years, automakers including General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F), Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) have all reported car hacking vulnerabilities to varying degrees.\n\nThis shouldn’t come as a shock – these firms are not technology companies, they are car makers.\n\nA three-year study from cyber security company IOActive found that more than half of car components had “flaws” that could be exploited by hackers to control parts of a vehicle’s key functions.\n\nThe leader of the research, Corey Thuen, said “Every system or component that we tested had at least one vulnerability.” That is scary!\n\nEspecially if one considers that some automakers like BMW (OTC:BMWYY) has said that 5G networks will be essential because its vehicles will need to transmit data constantly and communicate with other vehicles.\n\nAlphabet’s Waymo cars doesn’t require communications infrastructure. They are intended to be nearly completely self-reliant. Its vehicles will only have to open a link to the cloud to send or receive pertinent information such as traffic reports.\n\nThat seems the safer route to me than the approach of others in building self-driving cars. This is just another reason to own Alphabet for the long-term.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) closed at $828.17 on Friday, up $3.80 (+0.46%).

This was after it was ruled against by the French Constitutional Council. According to Reuters, the fiscal measure had been designed with the intention of making it harder for multinationals to pay as little tax as possible in France.\n\nLuring foreign investors and businesses\n\nThe ruling by France’s Constitutional Council comes amidst a government plan to increase the attractiveness of the country in the eyes of foreign firms following the British referendum that voted in favor of leaving the European Union.\n\n‘Google tax’ had been targeted at the multinationals that use tax regimes of different countries in a bid to lower tax liabilities. It had already been included in the 2017 budget law of France though the government has since admitted its reservations over the plans.\n\nFrance’s Constitutional Council also made the expansion of the planned financial transactions tax valid. This means that beginning 2018, intra-day transactions will have to pay the financial transactions tax. But depending on the outcome of the elections that are to be held in 2017, this might be challenged.\n\nTaxing at source in one year’s time\n\nThe Constitutional Council also validated a plan by the government to have the French taxed at source beginning 2018. This will mean that income tax payments will be deducted by employers from the gross pay a year from now. Currently, it is upon employees to declare their income and then settle the tax bill individually.\n\nThe decision by France’s Constitutional Court comes a little more than a week since the passing of a new budget law that could impose severe penalties on large US internet firms such as Google, Uber, and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) for tax avoidance practices.

Can Amazon.com, Inc. really dent Alphabet Inc?\n\nGoogle Losing Out To Amazon In E-Commerce Search\n\nAccording to a report by BusinessInsider , Amazon is slowly taking a sizeable chunk of Google\'s search business by becoming the go-to place for e-commerce search. As per the report, ""more than half of people start their search for online shopping on Amazon now, while only 26% use search engines like Google as the starting point"". Google is a search company, which makes more money when a larger number of people use its search engine. Now by losing market share in e-commerce search, Google is taking a hit on its revenue, as it is primarily dependent on search-advertising to generate revenue. The report gives more details about the trend, but what is more worrying for Google is that its e-commerce search-share has halved in last two years, whereas Amazon has gained drastically in the same period ( see image below). This is a serious concern for Google, and it appears as if things are not going to get any better in future.

This post describes how delightful Alexa is, and how Echo combined with Alexa is designed to make it easier for you to give more of your money to Amazon. At CES 2017 companies like Ford (NYSE:F), Huawei, LG, as well as a number of startups, all unveiled home appliances, phones, cars, and more gadgets with Alexa integration. Alexa even made an unexpected appearance on Google’s Android ecosystem. Chinese smartphone manufacturer Huawei announced that its flagship handset running on Alphabet Inc\'s Android operating system will come with an app that gives users access to Alexa in the United States.\n\nAmazon Echo has an early lead and plenty of buzz to go with it. The problem here is not that Amazon Echo is the smart speaker to beat for Google Home. There\'s more to this. There is a belief in the technology industry that such voice-powered digital assistants will replace keyboards and touch-screens as the primary way consumers interact with devices. In the report stated above, analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research considers that this shift is still in its initial stages, and that Google must move swiftly to make its presence felt in this space, to maintain its dominance in internet search, particularly on Android devices. Quoting him from the above report:\n\n“To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google’s voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that’s a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue”.\n\nAlso Read: Amazon.com, Inc Wins Big, But AMZN Stock Is Facing Strong Resistance\n\nThe thing is that the bad part doesn\'t end here for Google. The more Alexa devices that Amazon and its partners sell, the better Amazon does at its core retail business. It is believed that every Echo owner is a customer who is more likely to spend more on books, groceries, music, and movies on Amazon. But that is not the case with Google. Google can sell as many Google Home devices as it wants, but at the end of the day, Google is a search advertising company, not a retail company, and those Google Home devices aren\'t delivering ads. We all know Google is better at search than Amazon by a huge margin, and the company can still do a lot more with the data gathered on Home devices. The point is that consumers will be spending less time in front of screens and looking at Google\'s search ads. No matter how good Google\'s search ads are, it doesn\'t matter if people aren\'t seeing them.\n\nConsidering the first point stated in the article too, things are not looking any better for Google, going by the direction things are heading in, in computing space. It seems that Google\'s vulnerability is becoming Amazon\'s strength. Alexa\'s swift rise is making life difficult for Google.\n\nIn Summary\n\nPutting all the above factors together it is evident Amazon is gaining in Google\'s territory. Analysts believe Google\'s decision to debut its voice assistant exclusively on its own hardware might not have gone well with manufacturers. Given Google\'s plans to scale it across all other devices, the company needs to rethink its strategy. Sergei Burkov, CEO of Alterra.ai, an artificial intelligence company said "" Huge part of an assistant is search. Google is a search company. Amazon is not.” All is not lost for Google, yet, given the strength of its internet search technology, it can certainly catch up with the leader Amazon here. However, a growth investor would be tempted to invest in AMZN stock rather than GOOGL stock in 2017, since Amazon has many things going its way, where as Google has mainly its double-digit revenue growth to boast of. It is also to be noted that Google\'s Other Bet\'s have largely shown disappointing results until now which is not the case with Amazon.\n\nLooking for great tech stocks? Check out our top stock picks, which have beaten the NASDAQ by over 109%.', 'By all accounts Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) had a fabulous Consumer Electronics Show. According to InvestorPlace contributor Brad Moon, Alexa was the big winner of CES 2017 — an event the company didn’t even have its own booth at. The company’s Alexa voice assistant could eventually become an operating system, showing up last week in refrigerators, cars and robots. But what kind of affect does this have on AMZN stock?\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmazon’s ability to get its assistant supported by hardware contrasted with the failures of Siri from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Cortana from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and Google Assistant from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ).\n\nAmazon did it, first, by delivering the assistant to millions through its Echo speakers and, second, by allowing it to run on the cheapest imaginable hardware, focusing instead on the cloud-based Alexa Voice Service API. Rivals sought to use their voice assistants to tie hardware to their higher-end ecosystems, and they are unlikely to show much for consumer markets before next year.\n\nAMZN stock had fallen from a high of nearly $850 per share in October to a post-election low of barely $720. To many investors that is starting to look like yet-another missed opportunity to get in.\n\nSpectacular Whispers\n\nThe “whisper number” on Amazon’s Christmas-season earnings have become outrageous. The latest is for earnings of $1.43 per share on revenues of $44.70 billion. Last Christmas, by contrast, Amazon did $1.00 per share of earnings on revenues of $35.747 billion and, after another one of those discouraging falls (this time to near $500), rose steadily to that near-$850 high.\n\nIf AMZN stock matches expectations, you’re talking about top-line growth of 25% and earnings growth of 43%, year-over-year. You’re still talking about paying nearly three times sale for a retailer, when successful merchants like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT ) get just 40 cents of equity for each dollar of sales, but Amazon is no longer a retailer.\n\nSince then, of course, AMZN has become a major TV studio, with the Golden Globes to prove it. In addition to its $100 per year Prime shipping plan, which includes the video offerings and ties customers to the shopping service with free shipping, Amazon has added $10-per-month plans for music and eBooks — I’ve lately found the Kindle Unlimited offering to be outstanding.\n\nIts Amazon Web Services cloud is practically an industry standard, and its most recent report showed it growing 55% per year, to a run rate of over $11 billion, with high profitability. If Alexa is becoming an operating system, akin to Windows, Android and Apple’s iOS, many will consider it highly undervalued.\n\nThe Bear Case for AMZN Stock\n\nEvery story like this must include a bear case for the stock.\n\nBack in 2012, when I first started accumulating shares at about $330 each, bears claimed that Amazon didn’t make any money, that it was a “Ponzi scheme” and, essentially, an over-priced merchandiser.\n\nJust last week, InvestorPlace contributor Chris Tyler wrote that the technicals were bad, that the data collected by the Echo may become subject to judicial review and that the incoming Administration doesn’t like the company.\n\nScams are proliferating on the service and one long-time Amazon bull, Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities, told his followers to dump AMZN stock late last year, saying cloud growth catalysts are gone.\n\nNext Page', 'Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) has previously been put on the spot over hoaxes and so-called “fake news”.

Over the weekend a search function called “Featured Snippets” brought up news that became a buzz on the social media.\n\nA simple question on Google’s Snippets that read, “Is Obama planning a coup?” was answered with a funky answer that seemed to throw everyone off.

The fundamental valuation principles and investment thesis still apply in the same way as Class A stock.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a long opportunity capable of generating high shareholder returns over the next 12 to 18 months as well as for the long term. The company\'s stock is currently trading at a slightly lower price relative to its own historic level and compared to its peers, priced at LTM P/E of 29.3x versus 10-year median of 31.3x for GOOG and current median of 49x for its peers (see the full list in the later section). Although the valuations for these information technology (IT) firms are overpriced in comparison to 17.07x LTM P/E for S&P 500 IT sector index, the market is not realizing its potential growth opportunities in the coming years, as reflected in GOOG\'s current price level. GOOG\'s competitive moat and fundamental value proposition remain intact, and the stock is very susceptible to significant increase in price via catalysts such as the next earnings call.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nEver since Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded the company, GOOG was able to grow at an exponential rate due to two primary factors: the management capability and open-source platform of the business. At the center of all innovations that took place within GOOG lies the key leaders who took an unconventional approach to developing the business. For instance, GOOG\'s search engine became the world\'s best by pursuing one of its ten commandments ""focus on the user and all else will follow."" Page and Brin followed this principle by rejecting offers from its competitors from displaying ads on its main search page because doing so would distract users from searching what they were looking for. They also decided to make its main page a blank white background with only the search box in the middle in order to increase the efficiency in which users would be immediately be directed out of the search page and be led to the page they were looking for. The strong focus on improving the user experience by the management is what resulted in value creation.\n\nIn conjunction with the management\'s extraordinary ability to innovate, GOOG was able to expand its user base at an astonishing rate due to the open-source platform (free-of-cost services/products), which created network effect (as the number of users increases, the value of individual interaction with the search engine increases). The effect is due to the search algorithm where user\'s input is used to generate results. Since the outcome is a function of user input, the relevancy and accuracy of the results page will only improve as more users are involved in the process. The open-source platform allows the network effect to be prevalent in every aspect of the business, including Gmail, Google Maps and Google Chrome. The firm is able to gather tremendous amounts of data about its users while increasing its user base at the same time, creating numerous monetization opportunities such as advertising.\n\nGOOG\'s business segments are broken down to two parts: Google and Other Bets. Under Google lies profitable divisions such as YouTube while Other Bets has long-term so-called moonshot ventures that include driverless cars and artificial intelligence. This portfolio structure makes GOOG a very attractive investment in both short- and long-term horizons because not only the ad sales at its primary business is growing at an impressive pace of 21% YoY despite its Q3 revenue size of $21.5B but also its Other Bets segment is setting up the stage for future disruption as well. Thus, GOOG poses opportunity for profits in both near and future years.\n\nWhat Happened\n\nGOOG has underperformed the S&P 500 during 2016 (6.3% return vs. 11.1%, respectively). Although its stock appreciated, the momentum was subdued. The story over the past two years since its restructuring has been weaker than expected results for Q1 earnings 2016. It posted $7.5/share on $20.26B in revenue versus analyst estimates of $7.97/share and $20.37B in revenue, polled by Thomson Reuters. This was partially due to lower cost per click. The transition into mobile screens from PCs resulted in decreasing cost per click.\n\nMore than expected capital expenditures on the firm\'s Other Bets segment also caused a recent selloff in the stock as investors became cautious about the moonshot projects that are generating large losses. The capex for the ""Other Bets"" division amounted to $280M in Q3, about a 50% increase from the previous quarter, most of which came from the Google Fiber project. However, GOOG is going through initiatives to scale back some of these projects, which will be discussed in the later section.\n\nThe estimates for Traffic-Acquisition-Costs (TAC) has been growing as well. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat explained the narrowing margins were the result of higher TAC. For Q3, the street estimate for TAC was $4B before the Q3 release and the actual amount was $4.2B.\n\nThe recent macroeconomic events have also played their part in suppressing the valuation such as Trump\'s remarks on increased oversight on the tech firms\' activities in terms of job creation and EU antitrust lawsuits.\n\nThese factors together have limited the company\'s market price in recent years as well as EPS growth outlook for short-term and long-term forecasts. GOOG is currently trading at 29.3x LTM PE vs a 20-year median of 31.3x, and 1.54x multiple of S&P 500\'s LTM P/E vs. a 20-year median of 1.83. Based on both historical standards and the S&P 500 valuation, GOOG is seen as a growth stock that is trading at a fair price with more than 54% upside potential.\n\nCatalysts\n\nThe following catalysts will boost the company\'s price to its intrinsic value, well above the current valuation. In a worst case scenario, the company at its current price level is fairly valued, resulting in a wide margin of safety and minimal downside risk. Based on the company\'s diversified portfolio of investments in different areas of technology, its current valuation reflects the overblown fears by investors in response to recent events that do not have meaningful impact on the firm\'s fundamental business model.\n\n1) Q4 Earnings Exceeding Expectations Through Hardware Business\n\nThe current market price does not reflect better-than-expected hardware sales during Q4. Google released its first ever smartphone designed by the firm during Q4 and the product was well received by the consumers. During Q4, Alphabet sold 552k Pixel phones at $700 a unit for revenue of $386M, which could add about $1.8B sales for 2017E, according to research by Goldman Sachs. Furthermore, Google Home sales are another contributing factor to the optimistic outlook for Q4 earnings results, selling more than 500k devices at around $129 each for a predicted revenue of $65M. Although the estimated margins on these devices are tighter due to the capital expenditure required to initially drive the manufacturing and distribution processes, the profits from hardware sales will flow to the bottom line as Google realizes economies of scale with larger production volume.\n\nThe introduction of new products will not only drive the price upwards for Q4 but also create a stronger ecosystem as well as network effect as mentioned earlier in the report. Thus far, Google has been focusing on providing an open platform for its users in hopes to enhance the user experience. The free-of-charge applications such as Gmail, Google Maps and YouTube allowed the company to exponentially increase its user base and collect as much user information as possible. Now with more than 1 billion monthly users across its open platform services, Google has enough data about its users such as their search patterns, popular destinations and contact lists within their Gmail or Google accounts. The company can deliver ever more efficient services as it integrates these collected data into Pixel and Google Home. For instance, as the smartphone keeps track of the user\'s location, it can send the information to Google Home beforehand so that it will know when to start boiling a cup of hot tea. Similarly, as more consumers utilize these products, the accuracy of applications such as Google Maps and Google Search will only get better, strengthening the network effect.\n\nAside from hardware business, Google Play and Google Cloud Platform offerings will also contribute to earnings as they gain material cloud share from AMZN\'s AWS.\n\n2) Monetization Efforts along With Continued User Base Growth\n\nThe key investment thesis in Alphabet is that the company has numerous monetization opportunities under its umbrella of businesses. First, it could be making more money off of YouTube by charging for service through a subscription-based model or loading it up with ads. Rather than trying to monetize its viewership to its fullest extent right now, Alphabet is allowing it to grow (currently monthly viwers exceed 1B users). Some say if its viewership was to be monetized, YouTube could be worth as much as $300/share and right now investors are paying almost nothing for it. Recently, Google rolled out a paid subscription service called YouTube Red, which allows consumers to pay for ad-free peace when watching YouTube videos. This is a step for Google towards monetizing YouTube, potentially having significant accretive impact on its earnings.\n\nGoogle\'s second monetization opportunity is its Google Maps. The company began to place relevant ads on Google Maps both within its search results list and on the map with a purple icon. It is aimed at increasing visibility of businesses at ""micro-moment"" with passive in-map suggestions of relevant stores, local inventory search, or in-store promotions. Just like YouTube, Google Maps also has a tremendous user base with high-precision accuracy of location search. The quality of service will not be compromised by advertisements because the application has already created a lasting network effect. Likewise, the relevancy of the ad will only improve as the user base grows. The app presents a solid foundation for a cash-generating machine in the near-term future.\n\nLastly, the firm\'s core search business is expanding its breadth of advertising platform. It is now applying Expanded Text Ads and Individual Bid Adjustments in its search advertising business in order to maximize profits from the service. Due to tremendous amount of paid-clicks on these advertisements, Google will be able to take a sizeable proceeds from these expanded ad efforts.\n\nThe monetization gap will get narrower as the gap between the total time spent on media and U.S. mobile\'s share of overall ad budgets continue to tighten. In 2015, U.S. consumers spent 24.0% of media time on mobile, according to eMarketer, compared to mobile\'s 12.6% share of total U.S. media ad budget spent, according to Magna Global. In 2016, consumers spent 25.7% of their total media time on mobile devices while mobile\'s share of allocated ad budgets was 18.2%. The trends in increasing time spent on mobile devices as well as higher allocation of media budget on mobile illustrate the market for media ad on mobile platform is getting bigger. For CY16, the online advertising market is on track to increase by $26bn. This creates even greater monetization prospects for Alphabet.\n\n3) Undervalued Market Price and Solid Financial Position\n\nAlphabet is trading at a bargain at current market price. It has a net cash balance of about $120 per share which is not reflected in its P/E multiple. It also has the venture-capital arm that has yielded losses in the past 12 months, driving down the reported net income by about $4/share. With a P/E multiple of 28x, you are paying a negative $100 for venture-capital division, which includes the moonshot ventures such as driverless cars and artificial intelligence.\n\nSo take $800 per share market price, deduct the value for YouTube and the cash balance, and then add the venture-cap losses back to the reported earnings. Adjusting for these three factors, you are paying a very cheap price for just the Google division.\n\nThe earnings estimates reflected in the market price are also relatively conservative. The current consensus EPS for the fourth quarter is $9.64/share and sales estimate of $20.5B (Net of TAC). The estimates are based on conservative assumptions, 11.5% QoQ growth rate for Google Websites ad revenue versus 14.1% growth last year in the same quarter. The consensus also assumes higher TAC to Google Network Members, 70.4% compared to 70.1% last quarter. Assuming higher SG&A expenses related to Pixel and Google Home marketing efforts as mentioned by management during Q3 earnings call, the gross margin is assumed to be 61.7% and operating margin of 25.6% for Q4. The estimated margins are lower than the previous quarters which have averaged about 63% and 26.5%, respectively.\n\nAlong with the underappreciated stock value, Alphabet has an extremely healthy balance sheet that is able to not only support growth in hardware sales through infrastructure spending but also drive shareholder-friendly capital allocation policies. With a cash balance of $83B and total debt of $4B, the company is able to put its cash to work through a series of acquisitions, a share repurchase or a special dividend, all of which would benefit shareholders in the long term.\n\nIn addition to the strong cash balance, GOOG is most likely to sell part of its moonshot ventures and receive proceeds in additional cash. GOOG announced on 1/13/17 that it is shutting down the drone project known as Project Titan as well as the Google Fiber project, which attempts to deliver high-speed internet via fiber-optic cables. It is also selling its satellite business to a startup called Planet Labs Inc. These sell-offs will limit the losses created by the divisions and free up some capital to pursue other more optimistic moonshot initiatives like Project Loon, Project Wing, AI, and self-driving technology. I believe such a move is an efficient allocation of capital into investments that have better prospects of coming through, just as GE did with its numerous subsidiaries. The disciplinary actions relating to capital allocation seem very appropriate for GOOG\'s balance sheet and will add value to the firm in the long term.\n\nValuation\n\nAs mentioned previously, GOOG has been trading at a relatively cheap valuation compared to its peers like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).\n\nThe below table uses NTM valuations since the market is pricing GOOG based on its future earnings and what the investors are expecting in the coming months. Both NTM P/sales and NTM P/E for GOOG are on the lower end of the valuation spectrum relative to the universe of tech firms.\n\nHowever, GOOG is an unconventional company that is constantly introducing disruptive technologies. Thus, some would argue that it is inappropriate to compare its valuation to competitors but rather look at the company on its own.\n\nBelow is a breakdown on GOOG valuation based on three different scenarios over the next few years:\n\nBear Case\n\n2017E Net Income: $22.7B\n\nP/E: 23.3x\n\nMarket Cap: $528.9B\n\nShares Outstanding: 690M\n\nStock Price (Upside/Downside): $766.54 (-4.2%)\n\nThis scenario assumes GOOG\'s earnings will fall short relative to the consensus estimate ($23.0B). I assumed higher SG&A expenses than expected related to the Pixel and Google Home marketing costs and growing competition from Facebook over digital ads that may lead to slower growth in Google ad revenue. I also assumed P/E multiple much below the current LTM 29.3x.\n\nBase Case\n\n2017E Net Income: $23.9B\n\nP/E: 28.3x\n\nMarket Cap: $676.37B\n\nShares Outstanding: 690M\n\nStock Price (Upside/Downside): $980.25 (22.5%)\n\nThis assumes a conservative case where GOOG net income will exceed expectations while its P/E increasing to a higher multiple toward the median trading P/E of its peers at the current market level. As investors realize the growth potential through YouTube, monetization opportunities in Google Maps and hardware sales, the P/E will increase significantly.\n\nBull Case\n\n2017E Net income: $24.6B\n\nP/E: 33.7x\n\nMarket Cap: $829.0B\n\nShares Outstanding: 690M\n\nStock Price/Upside: $1,201.48 (50.2%)\n\nThis case assumes GOOG to continue building on its core search business while getting more efficient in TAC and SG&A expenses. Other growth prospects come from YouTube subscription based business and increasing investments into Cloud. Numerous investments allow ample room for opportunities to capture market share in different industries. P/E of 33.4x is appropriate considering the growth potential, huge piles of cash and the negative valuation put on its Other Bets division.\n\nBased on its 2017E net income, the return on invested capital (ROIC), the returns from the capital put into future working capital, PP&E, goodwill, and other intangible assets, would improve in comparison to its three-year historical average of 28.9%.\n\nRisks\n\nWhat could go wrong:\n\n1) As media time is spent more on mobile rather than desktops, revenue from ads may decelerate due to the nature of smaller displays.\n\n2) The monetization on next major revenue drivers - cloud, hardware, and Maps - may not materialize\n\n3) EU antitrust lawsuits posing greater regulatory risk around Android, Adsense and Shopping. This increases potential for more scrutiny over GOOG\'s operations in Europe.\n\nConclusion\n\nI believe that the market is offering investors a very attractive opportunity to allocate their capital in GOOG at a cheap multiple. As Warren Buffett once quoted, ""it\'s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price."" GOOG is not only a wonderful company but also trades at an attractive price point. The company will be able to expand its loyal base of users and generate total shareholder returns of 11.5% over the short term. At 25-27x 2017E P/E multiple, GOOG\'s intrinsic price would be trading at around $833.16-897.47, about 10% above the current levels. Most of the risks surrounding the company have disappeared post shut downs on capex-heavy projects like Project Titan and the firm continues to increase its earnings despite growing competition.\n\nA few remarks on GOOG. Google is now at a turning point where it could turn into even larger cash generating machine as it starts to monetize on its array of businesses. I believe these initiatives are most likely driven by earnings-conscious CFO, Ruth Porat, who joined the firm in 2015. I see her role within the company as the next cash flow booster in the firm\'s growth stages. She is making efforts to cut costs and generate cash flows in wherever possible, thus transitioning the company from a somewhat experimental, premature organization into a cost-efficient, free cash flow generating holdings company. That is not to say that the firm is compromising any of its business qualities or innovations taking place within its umbrella. Sergey Brin, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt continue to have the majority of the voting rights and they will constantly push towards establishing disruptive technologies in order to put Alphabet at the forefront of innovation. Thus, addition of Ruth Porat as CEO and other impactful leaders to the management are positive factors of growth in the long term.\n\nI view investing in GOOG as a long-term commitment and it is also a bet on its management. There will inevitably be a few bumps along the way but a major part of my investment thesis is the management\'s capability to handle those tough situations. Historically, the leaders at GOOG have proved their core values through the ""Ten commandments."" They decided not to expand their business in China, for instance, in order to stick to those principles. I view this characteristic of the management as a key factor in pushing the firm towards retaining its fundamental value proposition.\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are long GOOG.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

This follows criticism that has been leveled against the internet search giant after it emerged that a query on the search engine on whether the holocaust did actually happen was returning results from a neo-Nazi site.\n\nPrior to the fix, a couple of top results questioning the historicity of the holocaust were not only returning results but were even giving a revisionist account of Adolf Hitler, placing him in a positive light. Google, however, admitted that the problem was a challenging one and getting it right was not always possible.\n\n“Judging which pages on the web best answer a query is a challenging problem and we don’t always get it right,” a spokesperson for Google told Digital Trends.\n\nThe new move is a marked improvement from what Google had previously done to fix the problem, which was to give such results a lower ranking. It is not possible to determine how long the fix will hold in light of the fact that the previous fix failed to work consistently with the neo-Nazi website occasionally appearing as the top result. This even led to speculation that the supposed change by Alphabet had not actually been implemented.\n\nNot the first time\n\nFor Google, this will not be the first time its search results and auto-complete has invited criticism. A review by a newspaper based in the United Kingdom demonstrated how auto-complete was giving suggestions that were insulting, hateful, and inflammatory towards women, Muslims, and Jews. Google has promised to keep changing its algorithms over time in order to tackle such challenges as they emerge. That, however, also raises important issues surrounding censorship. Additionally, it also raises the question of whether the functions of search engines can be completely entrusted to algorithms without having to involve human editors.\n\nIn the last trading session that took place on December 23, 2016, shares of Alphabet fell by 0.23% to close the day at $807.80.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.', 'Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) revealed today that its app development platform known as Fabric is to be acquired by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Though top analyst Colin Sebastian sees this as a sensible move on the social media giant’s part considering its recent transition towards core services and platforms, he remains sidelined on the bigger picture.\n\nAs such, the analyst reiterates a Neutral rating on shares of TWTR with a $17 price target, which aligns with current levels.\n\nSebastian notes, “Twitter is kicking off the new year with greater focus on the core application and supporting features, such as investing in ad products (including MoPub) and in the ramping of additional streaming partnerships in an effort to fuel new user growth and strengthen advertiser engagement. Given sluggish user and revenue trends, and what appears to be limited interest from potential acquirers at current enterprise value, we can understand management’s increased emphasis in these areas.”\n\nUltimately, “Fabric’s development tools, including the top-rated Crashlytics and Answers app stability kits, grew to reach nearly 2.5 billion active mobile devices in two years. Despite the early success of Fabric, we believe Twitter’s decision to divest makes sense as part of a broader strategic move toward the company’s core services,” Sebastian concludes.\n\nColin Sebastian has a very good TipRanks score with a 74% success rate and a high ranking of #18 out 4,350 analysts. Sebastian garners 17.0% in his yearly returns. When recommending TWTR, Sebastian earns 0.0% in average profits on the stock.\n\nTipRanks analytics exhibit TWTR as a Hold. Out of 21 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 3 are bullish on Twitter stock, 13 remain sidelined, and 5 are bearish on the stock.

For the unfamiliar, Fabric was a segment of Twitter Inc\'s (NYSE:TWTR) business that offers a software toolkit for mobile apps.\n\nSubsequently, it is pertinent to note that both tech mammoths have declined to disclose the financial terms as of yet. Also, many experts believe that the deal will allow micro-blogging website to offload other assets as it’s currently facing intense amount of pressure to deliver growth. In contrast, the acquisition agreement will help the search engine giant to recruit mobile developers to its cloud service.\n\n""Somewhere along the line, our relationship with developers got a little bit complicated, a little bit confusing, a little bit unpredictable,"" Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey said. ""We want to come to you today first and foremost to apologize for our confusion. We want to reset our relationship and we want to make sure that we are learning, we are listening and that we are rebooting.""\n\nAs for why it decided to sell its developer platform, Twitter said it sold it because the company plans to focus on its core products and business in a bid to retain its position in the social media industry. Adding to that, the micro-blogging website recently announced to shut down its Vine video-sharing app, which gained popularity among wide range of creative users.\n\nThe micro-blogging website is facing fierce competition from Facebook. Twitter currently has 317 million users on its platform and Facebook boasts 1.7 billion monthly active users (MAUs) on its platform. Tech gurus believe that the company should roll out innovative features on its platform in order to retain its position in the social media industry.', 'Compteittion in the video has been rampant, with Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) enjoying dominance, but the game has been changed as YouTube, the Alphabet-owned company has hit a new milestone in viewership last year.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal notes that millions of people are spending billion of hours watching YouTube videos on the Video-sharing platform. From 2012, YouTube has experienced a ten-fold increase in viewership. Its milestone is over and above Netflix’s 116 million hours and the 100 million hours of daily streaming on Facebook.\n\nWhat was YouTube’s strategy to trump its rivals?\n\nA few years ago the company gave priority to viewing time over clicks. It was tapping into the the fact that people are increasingly using their mobile devices to access the internet. In fact, more than 60% of YouTube viewing is on mobile devices and tablets.\n\nIn acknowledging YouTube’s move, eMarketer principal video analyst Paul Verna wrote, “Marketers have long prized time spent as a measure of engagement, so YouTube’s emphasis on that aspect of its platform has positioned the company to capture a growing share of TV budgets.”\n\nYouTube’s milestone evidence of powerful innovations in personalization\n\nThere is notable competition in the digital video space, which is being triggered by new and successful properties. Innovation is increasing as every new entity fights to gain market share. YouTube usage remains strong and continues to be of importance to its parent company Alphabet.\n\nHowever, figures of daily usage are not yet published. There is a speculation that the video-sharing platform reached 185.9 million monthly US users in 2017. Monica Peart, eMarketer senior forecasting director points out that more and more viewers are becoming aware of YouTube.\n\nThe company has gone ahead to introduce a lightweight app in India as well. In the meantime, Alphabet’s stock closed at $849.67 witnessing an increase of $1.86 or 0.22%.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.', 'On YouTube’s official blog, Cristos Goodrow, vice president of engineering at YouTube, the huge video site, owned by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), reported its traffic had reached a remarkable milestone:\n\nA few years back, we made a big decision at YouTube. While everyone seemed focused on how many views a video got, we thought the amount of time someone spent watching a video was a better way to understand whether a viewer really enjoyed it. It wasn’t an easy call, but we thought it would help us make YouTube a more engaging place for creators and fans. And last year, we hit a big milestone on that journey: people around the world are now watching a billion hours of YouTube’s incredible content every single day!\n\nGoogle, the former name for Alphabet, bought YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion. For years, it was not a major contributor to Google revenue. Recently, that has changed. YouTube’s revenue last year was pegged at over $10 billion.\n\nYouTube has experimented with several business models. Among those are paid premium video services, meant to compete primarily with Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). However, YouTube has never been a major player in this business. Instead, Alphabet management has recently focused on video advertising, which tends to carry hefty premiums over traditional online advertising. Recently, Apple, Mr. Clean, Budweiser and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) have been large advertisers, based on data from the January YouTube Advertiser Leader Board.\n\nCNBC pointed out that YouTube has become more popular than Netflix and Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) combined.', ""YouTube viewers worldwide are now watching more than 1 billion hours of videos a day, threatening to eclipse U.S. television viewership, a milestone fueled by the Google unit’s aggressive embrace of artificial intelligence to recommend videos.\n\nYouTube surpassed the figure, which is far larger than previously reported, late last year. It represents a 10-fold increase since 2012, YouTube said, when it started building algorithms that tap user data to give each user personalized video lineups designed to keep them watching longer. Feeding those recommendations is an unmatched collection of content: 400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube each minute, or 65 years of video a day.\n\nFacebook Inc. FB, +0.29% and Netflix Inc. NFLX, +1.44% said in January 2016 that users watch 100 million hours and 116 million hours, respectively, of video daily on their platforms. Nielsen data suggest Americans watch on average roughly 1.25 billion hours of live and recorded TV a day, a figure steadily dropping in recent years.\n\nDespite its size, it is unclear if YouTube is making money. Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.19% GOOGL, +0.29% doesn’t disclose YouTube’s performance, but people familiar with its financials said it took in about $4 billion in revenue in 2014 and roughly broke even.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\n\nWhy more men are going into debt for plastic surgery (2:10) Men's plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures have grown 325% over the past 20 years.

Apparently, an average of only 40% of such reports were reviewed and addressed within the 24-hour window.\n\nHowever, the Commission admitted that “after 48 hours the figure is more than 80 percent.” Still, that one extra day is seemingly unacceptable and has prompted the Commission to consider drawing up legisltation that would force FB, GOOGL, MSFT and TWTR to maintain the agreed-upon 24-hour timeframe for reviewign complaints.\n\nNo information has been released regarding possible specifics of the legislation, but European justice ministers are scheduled to meet later this week for a closer examination of the report.\n\nWill This Change Anything for Users?\n\nGenerally speaking, it’s not likely. Considering the sheer number of users that these companies have (FB has more than 1.2 billion, GOOGL has more than 2 billion, MSFT has 750 million and TWTR has 317 million), the relative number of complaints regarding hate speech that have been reported over the past six months is almost non-existent.\n\nAccording to CNBC, “there were 600 notifications to the tech firms regarding hate speech.” Only 316 of them were determined to have possible merit, and of those only 163 resulted in content being removed or deleted. No information was shared as to the origin of those 600 reports and whether they came from Facebook, Google, Twitter or Microsoft.\n\nNext Page', '\n\nThe Good and the Risk in Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\n\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Looks Good But Has Risk\n\n2017-01-12\n\n"" Honda Motor (HMC) said Wednesday that it is in formal discussions with Waymo, the self-driving stand-alone unit of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), to add its autonomous vehicle technology to Honda vehicles.\n\n\n\nSource: BARRON\'S "" Source: Bloomberg\n\n"" Alphabet Inc. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV are doubling down on their self-driving partnership, adding about 100 more Pacifica Hybrid minivans to an autonomous fleet first announced in May, according to people familiar with the decision.\n\n\n\nSource: Bloomberg "" Source: Bloomberg\n\n"" The retail deals announced at the consumer technology show CES in Las Vegas hint at Google\'s broader ambition to merge its mapping capabilities with its core business of facilitating commerce.\n\n\n\nSource: Bloomberg "" Source: Bloomberg\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is making good progress into a diversified business -- but it also faces one very large risk.First, the company revealed how serious it\'s getting about self-driving cars, moving it from moonshot status to full blown company status in our CML Pro dossier: It\'s Time to Focus on Google In that dossier we note that Alphabet Inc created a new company under its umbrella called Waymo. Alphabet Inc teamed up with Fiat Chrysler to put its self-driving technology in a 100 Chrysler minivans. This serves as both a test for the self-driving car technology, and the earliest part of a potential blockbuster deal. Then we got this:As we wrote in that dossier:""It was lost in the wind of headlines, but Alphabet has already started talks with General Motors and Ford as well. Now, imagine for a moment that the self-driving revolution, which is coming much sooner than Wall Street understands, is driven by Alphabet\'s technology.Yeah, Tesla will have their cars, and likely Apple as well, but Chrysler, Honda and possibly other manufacturers partnering with Alphabet Inc could mean a leader has already been established.Let Tesla sell its 500,000 cars by 2018 if they can. Alphabet is looking to sell tens of millions within five years, with no cost of production, no assembly line, no radical new business - just the best technology in the world licensed to the largest auto makers in the world.""That was actually review, here is the new information we learned:But that was the distraction. The real news is that Alphabet is finally going after Uber. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is going to use the semi-autonomous Chrysler Pacifica fleet as a ride-hailing service. Waymo\'s next move is going to be to let people ""use our vehicles to do everyday things like run errands, commute to work, or get safely home after a night on the town.""That new build out with Fiat Chrysler looks like it\'s actually going to happen. But we got even more news from Google last week: The company has rolled out a new retail partnership with BMW and the Gap to deploy its 3-D-scanning project called \'Tango\'.The idea here is virtual shopping as a replacement or addition to \'real\' shopping. The vision is pretty clear with automobiles and it\'s nice to see Google going further with standard retail. ""A new app allows shoppers to test clothes from the Gap brand using Tango.""There are limited audiences for this technology right now, but looking to the future is always the right move for technology.This business, the self-driving car business, along with a possible new line with the Google Pixel smartphone, which we wrote about in our dossier Wall Street is Blind to Google\'s Upside Potential is finally giving us an eye to Alphabet\'s broader diversification strategy.But there is risk to Alphabet Inc -- one that\'s growing and one that is existential.(1) Google is losing a sizable piece of its business to Amazon in one particular area: e-commerce search, according to Eugene Kim of Business Insider.(2) Google better straighten out the \'fake news\' phenomenon.

Waymo CEO John Krafcik, announced at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit this week that the company has reduced the cost of its LIDAR sensor by a whopping 90%.\n\nLIDAR -- which uses lasers to map the vicinity, in this case allowing a vehicle to see everything around it -- is one of the most expensive technologies on a self-driving vehicle, and cutting is cost could pave the way to profitability for Waymo.\n\nWhat you get for the money\n\nLIDAR is how self-driving vehicles see the world around them. The technology is pretty easy to spot on a car -- it\'s usually encased in a dome atop the vehicle. Inside that, a laser spits out pulses of light that, when reflected off of objects, give the car detailed information about the locations and movement of whatever is around it.\n\nWaymo\'s new LIDAR system works the same way as earlier versions of the technology, but it\'s massively cheaper. Given that those older systems cost about $75,000, Krafcik\'s latest announcement implies that Waymo\'s new LIDAR probably costs about $7,500.\n\nThe more expensive LIDAR systems are arguably more accurate, but don\'t think that it means Waymo will be using a sub-par system for its upcoming self-driving services.\n\n""The detail we capture is so high that not only can we detect pedestrians all around us, but we can tell which direction they\'re facing,"" Krafcik said. ""This is incredibly important, as it helps us more accurately predict where someone will walk next.""\n\nWhy cheaper is better\n\nOne of the likely reasons why Alphabet spun Waymo out into its own company is because it believes Waymo can stand on its own and produce its own revenue.\n\nWaymo has said that it\'ll use its software and hardware for several different services, including personal transportation, ride hailing, logistics, and public transportation solutions. We\'ll likely get our first glimpse of its intentions later this year when it launches a service with Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU). Waymo will begin testing self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans on public roads next month.\n\nBut just as with any company, Waymo will need to focus on becoming profitable. Google\'s been pretty strict lately with those of its subsidiary companies that aren\'t making money, and has paused several projects (I\'m looking at you Google Fiber) that haven\'t panned out as expected. Waymo will succeed or fail based on its ability to turn its promising tech into tangible -- and lucrative -- products and services.\n\nThe self-driving market will be worth an estimated $77 billion by 2035, and a total of nearly 76 million vehicles with some level of autonomy are expected to have been sold by that year.\n\nAs with any other technology, reducing the cost so that consumers can afford it is key to Waymo\'s success. This latest LIDAR cost reduction is great news for the company, and it means Waymo\'s ride-hailing service -- which it aims to launch later this year -- is one step closer to reality.', 'When Alphabet Inc’s car unit, Waymo, launches commercially it will have a key weapon in its arsenal: specialised self-driving hardware built in-house.\n\nWaymo unveiled an improved suite of sensors and said it had slashed the cost of the pivotal technology on Jan 8 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. So far, Waymo has cut a deal with one carmaker, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, to outfit vehicles with its full self-driving kit, including hardware and software.\n\nIn the future, would Waymo sell hardware – like its new, cheaper LiDAR sensors – to other companies?\n\n”Possibly,” John Krafcik, Waymo’s chief executive officer, said in an interview with Bloomberg News on Jan 9.\n\nThe strategy would be a departure for the Google parent, which has touted its own complete autonomous vehicles in the past, not specific components. Sensor sales would give Waymo another crack at industry deals. Some carmakers, including Ford Motor Co, have balked during partnership talks over disagreements about data sharing, people familiar with the discussions have said.\n\nWaymo’s decision to build its own sensors, radar and cameras, in addition to software, may increase competition with companies that supply driverless technology to auto manufacturers. Shares of Mobileye NV, which develops systems that model vehicles’ surroundings, fell 4.4% to US$39.86 in New York, their biggest one-day decline since mid-November.\n\n”There is a chance that this development by Google will be considered further progress at a faster rate of change than Mobileye,"" Neil Campling, head of global tech, media and telecom research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, wrote in an e-mail on Monday. “The same could suggest that Google is moving further towards offering end-to-end solutions for the auto OEMs in the AV world and undermining Mobileye’s position.”\n\nCommercial applications\n\nKrafcik, a former Ford executive, described a wide range of commercial applications for the autonomous system. “You can count on Waymo being engaged in a lot of these areas, from logistics, to ride-sharing, to personal use licensing working with OEMs, to last-mile public transport solutions,” he said.\n\nHe declined to give details on the revenue model. Bloomberg News has reported that Waymo plans to start a ride-hailing service later this year, relying on Fiat Chrysler minivans.\n\nIn an earlier interview in Detroit, Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler, stressed that his company is a full-fledged partner with Alphabet, not simply a suppler. “We’re not losing money,” he said of the Waymo arrangement. “But it’s not something that changes our profit targets.”\n\nThe chief of the Italian-American automaker also confirmed an earlier Bloomberg News report that Chrysler will at least double the number of Pacifica minivans it is providing to Waymo.\n\nHonda Mobility\n\nKrafcik declined to offer more details on the Fiat Chrysler partnership. But he did address a possible deal with Honda Motor Co.\n\n”There’s just a really strong philosophical alignment between the two companies,” Krafcik said. “Honda represents Japan and a very aging society where there are a lot of mobility concerns. And a big part of our message has not just been safety but also mobility.”\n\nWaymo, which formed as a new Alphabet business in December, is one of the youngest companies in Detroit for the auto show this week. But it has worked on driverless technology for almost a decade. It’s now gearing up for a commercial launch after losing a cadre of early engineers this summer.\n\nKrafcik declined to give a timeline for a launch, but suggested the wait would not be a long one. “Sooner than you think,” he said. — Bloomberg', 'A joint venture between Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Levi’s, which began in 2015, has finally yielded fruit. The two have unveiled their smart commuter jacket, which will feature Google’s smart textiles platform; Project Jacquard. The interactive jacket marks the first widely available product using the new technology and will enable its wearer to give instructions to their Smartphone devices.\n\nThe jacket is dark denim plus it is easy to sport many of its other features on a majority of Levi’s commuter coats. However, it has a standalone uniqueness; the small screenless fabric touch interface on the left wrist. As the name suggests the Commuter jacket, which will sell for $350 is particularly for cycling commuters.\n\nGoogle’s new jacket is a step forward technologically\n\nWearable technology is on a tear. It is perhaps the reason why Google has also chosen to be part of the advancing IoT. The technology can be used to manage basic mobile apps.\n\nIts touch interface has the capability of recognizing close to five gestures for example; full palming, making a circular motion, brushing in and out, and double tapping.\n\nArs Technica writes, “Jacquard allows wearers to control their mobile experience and connect to a variety of services, such as music or maps, directly from the jacket. This is especially useful when it might be difficult to use the smartphone.”\n\nGoogle hopes to get developers enticed with the possibilities within the jacket\n\nA lot still needs to be done on the jacket in regards to its development for it to fit in the real world. Ars Technica explains that developers have an opportunity of developing other apps or create new features for the platform.\n\nMeanwhile, Google has expressed its optimism about the future of Jacquard. The search giant says it will constantly try to deploy the tech beyond it being a simple Smartphone companion. In the meantime, Alphabet’s stock was trading at $864.58 witnessing an increase of $3.17 or 0.37%.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.', 'The expectation among most tech aficionados was that wearable tech would help to make consumers less reliant on smartphones and better able to integrate technology into their everyday lives. Unfortunately, though, many wearable tech products have failed to meet customer expectations. Oftentimes, these products are hampered by poor design, functionality issues, and more. Nonetheless, developers continue to try to design and market the wearable tech product which will manage to break through into mainstream use, marking the perfect combination of cost, functionality, and design. The latest product to hit the market, Levi\'s connected smart jacket, made in partnership with Google, aims to do just that.\n\nProject Jacquard\n\nThe new jacket is made thanks to technology developed by Alphabet, Inc.\'s (GOOG) Project Jacquard, according to a report by The Verge. This division has created special conductive fibers that can be woven into clothing. Thus, by making motions and taps on the cuff of one of the jacket\'s sleeves, the connected wearable will register inputs as if it were a smartphone screen. Those inputs can then be sent to different devices thanks to a Bluetooth attachment cufflink on the jacket arm. Best of all, perhaps, is that the conductive fibers by Jacquard are both flexible and washable, so you don\'t have to worry about removing them every time you clean the jacket. The cufflink, on the other hand, does have to be removed before washing.\n\nExcitement About the Jacket\n\nThe Jacquard and Levi\'s jacket has been demonstrated with full functionality in the past, and most recently at the SXSW showcase in Texas. While the jacket was originally slated for commercial release in the spring of 2017, that date has been pushed back to the fall. Analysts suspect that it may not be because of the jacket; the delay may have been due to the app which interfaces with the jacket\'s technology, which has been shown to be incomplete in recent demonstrations. According to the Verge article, a spokesperson for Google indicated that the company has ""been going through continuous consumer wear testing to refine the jacket and its abilities. We want to be sure we take the time to get it right.""\n\nThe jacket is currently set to retail for $350, which makes it pricier than a regular jacket by Levi\'s but not outrageously expensive. So far, the tech functionality seems to be fairly minimal, but Google and Levi\'s have added plans to incorporate more functions later on. The jacket may be enticing to those who are reluctant to put on obvious wearable tech devices, as it blends in well with non-smart jackets and is more discreet than smart glasses, wristbands, and similar tools. The release date in the fall will be the test of whether or not the new jacket is really the future of this industry.', 'This fall, Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google and Levi Strauss & Co. will release a smart jacket developed under the name Project Jacquard. The companies first announced their plans to work on connected garments nearly two years ago. Until today, no pricing or availability details were known.\n\nGoogle visionaries and Levi’s style icons discussed the new smart jacket on a panel titled Beyond the Screens: the Ubiquity of Connectivity at South by Southwest in Austin this weekend. The event presented the two collaborators with a high-profile opportunity to show and explain the new jacket to the public.\n\nThe Jacquard commuter jacket contains a screen-less fabric touch interface on the left wrist that is practically invisible. That surface lets the wearer control certain actions on their smartphone while wearing the jacket.\n\nAn extended USB stick slides into the jacket and snaps into place as a cuff button. The button then briefly glows in a blue circle, giving the user visual confirmation that systems are activated. Without the USB in place, the jacket’s smart capabilities will not work.\n\nThe jacket will let you get directions, adjust the volume on your music or answer a phone call with finger swipes on the jacket’s fabric. The jacket has five accepted gestures: double tap, full palm, brush out, brush in, and a circular motion. Jacquard also alerts the user to calls or texts with a small rumble on the wrist.\n\nGoogle developed an app allowing users to assign meanings to things done on the surface. Initial setup is also done through the app. Google and Levi’s hope to add more functions down the line.\n\nThe Jacquard commuter jacket looks like another variation of the sleek Levi’s trucker jacket. The jacket also contains standard features from Levi’s commuter line, including reflective strips and sleeve pockets.\n\nThe touch-enabled area of the jacket does not look or feel any different than other Levi’s products. The left wrist doesn’t wear differently than the right one. You can’t wash the USB device, but you can wash the button.\n\nIvan Poupyrev, technical program lead at Google’s Advanced Technology And Products (ATAP) group, said, “I believe this is going to be the first commercial product which takes the touch interaction of the screen and puts it on an actual product.” The jacket is expected to go on sale for $350 this fall.\n\nJacquard’s conductive yarn enables the use of touch sensors or haptic feedback right within the materials themselves. The project is starting as part of a denim jacket, but it can be applied to any fabric.\n\nLevi’s has also created a brand installation near the Austin convention center, so interested parties can learn about, demo, and wear the new Jacquard tech. The installation will be open throughout the week. Interested potential customers can sign up to receive updates about the project through atap.google.com/jacquard.', 'Shares of Alphabet Inc.

Specifically, YouTube is reducing the number of views of his videos while some of his videos are no longer accessible for his subscribers. What bothers him the most is that YouTube does not give an acceptable and proper explanation as to why.\n\nKjellberg has noted that the changes imposed by YouTube through time feels more like a “kick in the face”. Moreover, with YouTube employees being completely clueless about what it’s like to be a content producer on the platform and to actually produce content, he now wants to quit one of the biggest channels on YouTube. This is consistent with his previous statement that he will permanently delete his channel after reaching the 50-million-subscriber mark.\n\nNonetheless, it is important to note that Kjellberg does not plan to quit being a content producer on YouTube entirely. Once he deletes PewDiePie, he plans to create a new channel and build it again from the ground up.\n\n“I’ve decided the only way to stop my channel from dying— I know you are going to think I am joking— but I am going to delete my channel,” elaborated Kjellberg.\n\nYouTube’s Argument\n\nOn the other hand, YouTube has maintained that it is not intentionally reducing the number of video views or number of subscribers of certain users at all.\n\nUpon reviewing the concerns, YouTube has found out that some subscribers are unsubscribing from channels on their own. Also, YouTube has emphasized that it regularly reviews and removes spam accounts to provide all users with a healthy environment free from spam and anything that may compromise a valuable experience. Consequently, this ensures that all viewer and subscriber counts are accurate. After all, these statistics play a major role in determining the revenue of users.\n\nAlphabet has closed at $791.47 on Wednesday, rising 1.97%.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.', 'On April 23, 2005, the very first YouTube video was released. Eleven years later, YouTube has grown to have 5 billion videos watched a day, 1.3 billion total number of users, an estimated annual revenue of $10 billion for 2016 and yet it is not profitable. In fact at a recent summit, the CEO of YouTube had stated that it is still in investment mode. Originally purchased in October 2006 by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for $1.65 billion, it is now estimated to have a valuation of $70 to $90 billion on its own. Making about 13% - 17% of the current market cap of Google, we wanted to do some analysis of the risks and opportunities that YouTube has coming ahead. Especially since there have been recent videos put out by major content creators including PewDiePie, the #1 most subscribed YouTuber, contemplating quitting the service.\n\nHistory\n\nStarting out as a failed dating website, who knew YouTube would end up being the central hub for video content today. Chad Hurley, Steven Chen and Jawed Karim came up with the idea back in 2005 when they figured the website would work as a dating website where single people would post up videos of themselves to attract others for dates. In fact on the main page of the website you would be entering in your sex and age. Like most success stories, this one had humble beginnings. No one used the first iteration of this website. The creators were so desperate for users that they put Craiglist ads to pay for people to upload videos on their website.\n\nIt was the original community who really defined what YouTube would be. Instead of making dating related videos, users would instead upload videos of everything else to share with their friends and family. The original community of YouTube was what led the original founders to revamp the site to be more open and general to entice others to upload videos of whatever they wanted. This is the backbone of what YouTube is today. After Sequoia Capital help fund this venture and began looking for advertisement deals, YouTube began to really hit off with the general public. In fact it was this famous Nike Ad to be the first video to reach a million views. In 2006, Google purchased the company after seeing the potential this platform had for advertising. The following is a synopsis of risks and opportunities we see ahead for YouTube.\n\nYouTubers quitting and increased competition\n\nIt was this video by YouTuber PewDiePie quitting that inspired me to write this article. Now it remains to be seen how serious he is to go through with this promise but there is always a risk of talent leaving and taking their subscriber base as well. His main complaint was the subscriber dumps that YouTube would go through from time to time. YouTube does this to get rid of ""ghost"" accounts. ""Ghost"" accounts are determined based on their viewing history and will be removed from a channel if they have not had any recent views of that channel. Although it does hurt a channel from an aesthetics point of view due to lowering their subscriber, this is a necessary process. By removing accounts that no longer watch your content, it allows YouTube and the advertisers find a better match for their ads based on your subscriber base.\n\nThere are many reasons why YouTubers quit such as stress or running out of creativity. However there has also been some instances of poaching. Two years ago, there was a huge push by Yahoo to reinvent itself and become more competitive with Google. One of their tactics was to lure content creators by enticing them with higher ad revenue share. Currently Google retains 45% of the advertising earned by content creators. In 2015, Vessel was on the hunt trying to poach content creators by enticing creators with higher CPMs. YouTubers earn about $2-3/CPM vs. what Vessel claimed to be able to provide $50/CPM. Their caveat was that content creators also would release videos on their website three days ahead of being released on YouTube, creating an early access pay wall. Coincidentally, both of the aforementioned companies were both purchased by Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in 2016. Although there has yet to be a viable competitor, there will always be future competitors who will attempt to dethrone YouTube. There has been a lot of consolidation in the media place such as AT&T (NYSE:T) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) and I would not be surprised if a media giant were to attempt enter the online video space in the future.\n\nThe Black market of Online Advertising\n\nYouTube marketing is strong because it can achieve the holy grail of marketing, which is advocacy. Advocacy in marketing is a term which describes the type of marketing that we receive from friends and families. YouTube builds this relationship with viewers through the trust gained by the content creators. In a recent Nielsen report, it found that users trusted online consumer opinions 66% of the time when making a purchase. Due to the fact that YouTube is on the frontier or marketing, it is no surprise that it has also created its own ""black-market"" for advertising.\n\nOn a larger level there has been illegal product placement such as the Xbox One controversy. In summary what happened was that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was paying gaming channels to promote their product in a positive light without disclosure that they were being paid to do so. It is explicitly outlined on the FTC website that this is illegal.\n\nOn a smaller level there has been paid shills to YouTubers without disclosure (pictured below). The email below was to a fellow smaller YouTuber with only a few thousand subscribers who reviews tech parts. When he replied back to the email telling them they would review the product for free if they got a demo, they got back an email stating that they would only get the product if they gave positive reviews.\n\nIf the FTC were ever able to crack down on this illegal black market for advertising dollars it could serve to be a windfall to YouTube. Currently these advertising dollars are being diverted away from YouTube by going straight to the YouTuber. By removing this black market it would increase the amount of money going into legal advertising giving benefit to YouTube.\n\nValuation\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to know how much our investment in YouTube will be worth in the future. Since YouTube is not generating any earnings right now, the only method of valuation we can use is a price multiple on sales. Taking the average of related companies, the Max, the Min and Google\'s current valuation, we were able to get within the valuation metrics that were being touted by Wall Street. Next using the same metrics we wanted to calculate the value of YouTube in four years, 2020, to see how much the valuation of YouTube growth alone could add to Alphabet\'s market cap. The growth rates that UBS has proposed in YouTube revenues does present an interesting growth opportunity that implies as high as an annualized 8% share increase just based on YouTube\'s growth and assuming the rest of Alphabet does not grow at all.\n\nConclusion\n\nYouTube has grown up in the past 11 years and it still has a lot to grow. Based on the growth projections, Google could be a fantastic long-term holding for any portfolio. While the media may be over blowing the vast exodus of key subscribers of YouTube, it is clear that Wall Street will not quit on YouTube if there is money to be made.\n\nPlease hit the follow button above if you would like me to go further into the business of YouTube.

Uber Technologies Inc. allegedly did it in nine months.\n\nWaymo claims in a lawsuit filed Thursday that was possible because a former employee stole the designs and technology and started a new company.\n\nThe complaint intensifies Alphabet’s rivalry with Uber, one of the Internet giant’s largest investments, and reflects an escalating talent war in the burgeoning autonomous-driving arena as tech and auto companies alike compete for skilled engineers. Legal fights are multiplying after General Motors Co. and Uber valued upstarts -- each with just a few dozen employees -- as worth hundreds of millions of dollars in separate acquisitions last year.\n\nWaymo accuses several employees of Otto, a self-driving startup Uber acquired in August for $680 million, of lifting technical information from Google’s autonomous car project. The “calculated theft” of Alphabet’s technology earned Otto’s employees more than $500 million, according to the complaint in San Francisco federal court.\n\n“We take the allegations made against Otto and Uber employees seriously and we will review this matter carefully,”’ Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler said in an e-mail.\n\nRead More: Fight Over Tesla’s Self-Driving Pro Shows Talent War Escalating\n\nThe claims in Thursday’s case include unfair competition, patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation.\n\n“Fair competition spurs new technical innovation, but what has happened here is not fair competition,” Waymo said in the complaint. “Instead, Otto and Uber have taken Waymo’s intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology.”\n\nWaymo was inadvertently copied on an e-mail from one of its vendors, which had an attachment showing an Uber lidar circuit board that had a “striking resemblance” to Waymo’s design, according to the complaint.\n\n14,000 Files\n\nAnthony Levandowski, a former manager at Waymo, in December 2015 downloaded more than 14,000 proprietary and confidential files, including the lidar circuit board designs, according to the complaint. He also allegedly created a domain name for his new company and confided in some of his Waymo colleagues of plans to “replicate” its technology for a competitor.\n\n“Misappropriating this technology is akin to stealing a secret recipe from a beverage company,” Waymo wrote in a blog post explaining the suit.\n\nLevandowski left Waymo in January 2016 and went on in May to form Otto LLC, which planned to develop hardware and software for autonomous vehicles.\n\n""These are very serious allegations, if true,"" said Tyler Ochoa, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law. ""The trade secret case by itself is a blockbuster.""\n\nWaymo’s complaint contains such specific information about the devices used and the dates the information was downloaded that it’s ""hard to believe they’d put those accusations into print unless they had evidence,"" Ochoa said in an interview.\n\nAlphabet’s venture capital arm, GV -- formerly known as Google Ventures -- is an early backer of Uber.\n\nWaymo’s lawsuit is ill-timed for Uber, a company already mired in crisis over allegations of sexual harassment and recently beset by customer losses due to ties to President Donald Trump. Uber this week set up a commission led by former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder to investigate a former developer’s allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination by her manager.

Those that have Moto Z series and LG G5 owners, Sony Xperia XZ, Google Pixel phone series as well as X Performance series, among others with Adnroid 7.0 Operating sytemtn are also compatible with Netflix VR.\n\nThe Netflix VR app has an enormous virtual screen and a rich digital environment. Thus everyone will watch their favorite shows as if they are in front of their home TV. The Daydream controller makes it possible to access all the content currently up on Netflix thanks to the virtual interface.\n\nBut Netflix VR Is a Stand-Alone Application\n\nNetflix’s VR platform cannot be compared to the likes of Hulu and HBO apps, which have a bit more options to take advantage of. It is a standalone application. The use of a phone to watch movies or any of Netflix shows will require a subscription. But all said and done, Netflix VR app on Google Play Store may be the best milestones that Netflix has achieved.', 'Published By: Ken Bock on December 9, 2016 09:20 am EST\n\nAlphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Daydream VR now supports more games, HBO Now and HBO GO; now users have juicier content to enjoy.

From Mashable:\n\nIndia’s outspoken IT, Law and Justice Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad today requested Sundar Pichai to make Google more involved with India’s cyber security efforts. “In a larger push, I want Google to be involved in a more meaningful way. The more digital we go, the more challenges there will be in terms of cybersecurity,” Shankar said onstage at an event where Pichai announced Digital Unlocked initiative for India’s small and medium sized businesses.\n\n“Google is as much an Indian company as American. The sheer number of people in India who have accepted you means you have an obligation for India as much as you have for the United States,” Prasad continued.\n\nThe feeling is reciprocal. Google recently unveiled plans to bring free internet access to over a billion users worldwide, with hundreds of millions of those residing in India. It’s already partnered with Indian rail companies to provide access via certain train stations, with many more on the way.\n\nAlphabet Inc shares were unchanged in premarket trading Wednesday. Over the past year, GOOGL has gained 3.86%, versus a 13.12% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.\n\nGOOGL currently has an StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 44 stocks in the Internet category.\n\nThis article is brought to you courtesy of StockNews.com.', 'NEW DELHI—Alphabet Inc.’s Google is ramping up its efforts to get India’s small businesses online, the latest step in its quest to win new users in the populous nation.\n\nGoogle Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on Wednesday that the Mountain View, Calif., company will launch this year a tool that allows owners of small businesses that are now...', 'The Accelerated Mobile Pages of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will now be available to over a billion people in the Asia Pacific region following the formation of partnerships between the Mountain View, California-based technology giant and internet companies in the region.

Then, its launch was seen as a way to counter a similar system by Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Instant Articles, which was growing fast.\n\nInaugural Developer conference\n\nThe partnership between Google and the Asia internet firms was disclosed in New York City during the inaugural AMP developer conference. David Besbris, Google’s engineering vice president commented that the partnerships would ultimately be to the benefit of internet users since the reach of AMP pages would be extended with the partnerships. It would also assist publishers in that they would only need to create one file without having to configure to fit in the various devices and platforms.\n\n“[AMP pages are] the same as the web. That’s not typically the case in the distribution platforms,” said Bebris.\n\nGrowing uptake of AMP\n\nIn the United States, the platforms and services that already offer support for AMP include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) LinkedIn, Pinterest, eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), and Bing. Tumblr, which is owned by Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO), is in plans to provide support for AMP. With regards to LinkedIn, Besbris noted that AMP articles on the platform were more engaging and readers spent 10% more time on them vi-a-vis non-AMP articles.\n\nThe vice president of engineering at Google also added that even though accelerated mobile pages were originally devised for news articles, the system has since then been extended to other online content and platforms including in areas such as e-commerce. Some of the earliest adopters of AMP were Buzzfeed and The New York Times.\n\nIn Wednesday’s trading session, shares of Alphabet Inc edged up by 0.29% to close the day at $853.64 a share.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.', 'Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), a NASDAQ Stock giant is making the AI-helper available on its Google Home device and Pixel smartphones, increasing its competitive edge against the Android ecosystem offerings of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nOn Sunday at the ongoing Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Google announced that the Google Assistant will be compatible with smartphones running on Android 6.0 and above. This means Google Assistant will be able to work on nearly one-third of current Android smartphones, including the LG Electronics phones that were unveiled at Mobile World Congress on Sunday.\n\nAccording to estimates, Google shipped a total some half million Pixel smartphones and an additional half million Google Home speakers in the fourth quarter. This gives the Google Assistant an upper hand compared to Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri both of which are NASDAQ Stock tech giants.\n\nA big number of smartphone manufacturers will use the Mobile World Congress currently going on in Barcelona to roll out their latest offerings to the market hope to get sales in time before Apple unveils its its 10th anniversary iPhone expected this fall.\n\nAfter releasing new tablets, Samsung Electronics has confirmed it will be unveiling the next flagship smartphone on March 29. On the other hand, the G6, LG’s new flagship has a 2:1 aspect ratio, slightly taller than the traditional 16:9 ratio. Unconfirmed reports have indicated that Samsung phones and the next-generation iPhone may have 2:1 ratios. This means the screen can display more text.\n\nHuawei, China’s tech giant unveiled P10 handsets on Sunday. The P10 smartphones are come with the GoPro Inc (NASDAQ:GPRO) mobile app for editing. GoPro intends to persuade more Huawei users to purchase a GoPro camera. In recent years, Asia has been a growth zone for GoPro which has recorded declining sales in the U.S markets.\n\nGoogle Assistant will be unveiled this week in the U.S market. This will be followed by English versions in U.K, Canada and Australia and German in Germany. Google intends to develop more Assistant languages but the company gave scanty details over the same.', 'Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), is expected to introduce its next-generation Pixel 2 smartphone this year.\n\nThe search engine company launched two smartphones under the Pixel brand in October last year. The 100% made-by-Google phone features Google Assistant, a top-rated 12-megapixel camera, and a fast charging technology, among others.\n\nThe Pixel is available in two sizes: a 5-inch X model and a 5.5-inch XL model. According to Jay McGregor of Forbes, the Pixel XL was the best phone of 2016. A report from AFR described the Pixel XL a much better than the iPhone 7.\n\nThe tech world is now waiting for the update of the Pixel. The next-generation Pixel 2 might arrive this October with the cool camera and improved chipset.\n\nLet’s take a look at rumors surfacing about the Pixel 2.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here\n\nGoogle Pixel 2 Rumors\n\nThe Pixel 2 is expected to come with better water-proof technology.\n\nCiting a reliable source, 9to5 Google reported that the company is focusing intensely on the camera and testing improved chipsets from two different manufacturers.\n\nThe source also told the publication that the Mountain View company is testing lower-end Pixel devices.\n\nGoogle’s major focus is to improve the Pixel 2’s camera technology, according to the source. Specifically, the company is aiming to master low light photography with the next-generation device.\n\nThe next-generation Pixel 2’s camera will “not have large MP size,” but will rather “compensate in extra features,” 9to5 Google reported citing the source.\n\nIn addition, the source said that the search engine giant is testing multiple Pixel 2 models with improved chipsets. Some models are using Snapdragon 83X chips, while others have Intel chips.\n\nFurther, the company is testing a “few” prototypes of a device they referred to as “Pixel 2B”, which would is expected to be released either “alongside or shortly after Pixel 2.” This would be a lower-price device “aimed at different markets,” the source said, adding that the company is looking to bring the “Google experience and the Google Phone to emerging markets.”\n\nMeanwhile, the source said that the company developed “a custom chipset for a test device.” However, the source was not sure whether this custom chipset is coming to the Pixel 2.\n\nGoogle Will Sell Over 5 Million Pixel Phones This Year: Analyst\n\nThe Pixel smartphone runs Android Nougat 7.1 operating system. It is the first phone made by Google inside and out.\n\nThe Pixel 1 features Google Assistant, the built-in customer support service, unlimited and free backup of full-res photos and videos, and Smart Storage. It is available in three colors: very silver, quite black and really blue.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said that the Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) subsidiary would generate $3.8 billion in revenue by selling 5.5 million Pixel smartphones in 2017.\n\nNowak also estimates that the Pixel phone, expanded text ads, a fourth mobile ad unit, and Maps will generate $6.5 billion in revenues for the search engine giant in 2017.', 'Bottom line: Google\'s new launch of a China-based developers site marks a partial return to the Chinese web, but its higher-profile return to the consumer market with a Chinese Google Play app store probably won\'t come until next year.\n\nAfter more than a year of speculation, global search leader Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is finally back in China. Or at least sort of. The tech world is certainly buzzing about this latest development, which comes with Google\'s launch of a China page for locally-based developers. For anyone who wants to look, the page itself is at developers.google.cn, and is all in English. But proving its China credentials, the page also has a QR code that lets users follow Google Developers on WeChat.\n\nSo, what does all of this mean? The development does seem relatively significant, since this launch appears to show that Google has officially received Beijing\'s blessing to develop new business in China, in this case by pursuing local developers. Up until now, Google\'s only presences on the China web were its google.cn page, which has a live link to its Hong Kong page, and also its Google translation service.\n\nWe\'ll explore the broader implications shortly, but first, let\'s review the latest headlines that come from a developer conference that Google held on Thursday in Beijing (Chinese article). The conference marks at least the company\'s second major event in China this year, following its opening of an experience center in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen back in July (previous post). Some might say this staging of this latest event in the Chinese capital might have some symbolic significance, since Shenzhen is much further away and just across the border from the capitalist enclave of Hong Kong.\n\nBoth meetings were presided over by Google\'s Greater China chief Scott Beaumont, who happens to be a China hand and speaks Mandarin. About 2,000 people attended, and Google executives said they will start to introduce some Mandarin into the local Chinese developers site that is now all in English. There\'s not much more to the reports, though Google\'s executives did manage to utter the word ""innovate"" quite a few times in their remarks, using a word that has become a favorite of Beijing leaders these days.\n\nIt\'s certainly no surprise that Google is trying to curry favor with Beijing. Such an approach would have been surprising 7 years ago, when Google angrily shuttered its China-based search site due to unhappiness over Beijing\'s strict self-censorship policies. But since then, the company has been having second thoughts. The biggest reason for the turnaround is the rapid rise of smartphones over that period, and Google\'s place in the market through its free Android operating system that powers the big majority of those smartphones.\n\nGetting High-Profile\n\nI\'ve written about numerous signs that Google was preparing a return to China over the last year, including reports that it was laying the necessary infrastructural groundwork and also various other behind-the-scenes steps it was taking. This kind of high-profile event also shows the company wants to be in the market, and is just waiting for the right moment when Beijing finally gives the green light.\n\nI previously predicted that Google\'s China return would come this year, but now it looks like time is rapidly running out. Perhaps I could argue I was partly correct, since this launch of a China-based page does represent a return of sorts. Honestly speaking, I don\'t think that Google wants to return to the China search business due to Beijing\'s controversial self-censorship policies. But perhaps it will reopen a China-based search page as part of its return to show Beijing that it has learned its lesson, in a sort of eating crow.\n\nWhat Google really wants is to get more ingrained in China\'s vibrant Android ecosystem, where it could potentially make lots of money by helping developers create new Android-based apps and services. From a public perspective, its main objective on that front would be the opening of a China version of its Google Play store, and also perhaps eventually launching a payment service similar to Apple Pay.\n\nThis latest developer\'s conference does indeed appear to show that Google is again inching towards those goals. I probably shouldn\'t make any more predictions after my last one didn\'t really come through, or at least probably won\'t happen before the end of 2016. But in this case, it really does seem quite likely that Google will finally get its coveted permission to open a China app store sometime in 2017, and could also relaunch a China search page to show its repentance.\n\nDisclosure: None', ""Oslo, Q8, based Investment company DnB Asset Management AS buys Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc, Oracle Corp, Abbott Laboratories, Fitbit Inc, sells Western Digital Corp, Mead Johnson Nutrition Co, VMware Inc, Finisar Corp, Pfizer Inc during the 3-months ended 2016-12-31, according to the most recent filings of the investment company, DnB Asset Management AS.

U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu on Wednesday ordered an emergency halt to Trump\'s executive order that aimed to temporarily bar entry to the United States of most refugees as well as travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The halt is temporary.\n\nTrump says the ban is necessary for U.S. national security, and called Watson\'s order ""unprecedented judicial overreach.""\n\nTech companies, which generally rely on skilled workers from overseas more than other industries, played a large part in the legal effort to halt the first version of Trump\'s executive order, which was put on hold by a Seattle judge in early February.\n\nIt was not immediately clear why fewer of them signed on to the ""friend-of-the-court"" brief this time around.\n\nCompanies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. ""We do expect the group to expand.""\n\nRide-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc was in the process of adding its name, a spokesman said.\n\nBox Inc, a file-sharing service, said that although it did not sign the brief, there had been no change to its position.\n\nA Twitter spokeswoman pointed to past company statements opposing Trump\'s initial travel ban in January but declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment.\n\nRepresentatives of Apple, Google, eBay, Intel, Microsoft and Netflix did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n(Reporting by David Ingram; Editing by Bill Rigby)', ""Alphabet Inc.

Daily - Enter your email address below to receive a concise daily summary of the latest news and analysts' ratings for Alphabet Inc. and related companies with our FREE daily email newsletter."", 'Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of those companies that receives a lot of coverage with a wide range of price targets. While it is difficult to peg a price target on Alphabet with traditional valuation methods, I believe there is sufficient evidence that a large margin of safety exists at the current price level. I like to frame the opportunity something like this: Alphabet\'s Google division alone can easily justify the current stock price of a little more than $800 per share, with the venture capital arm and ""other bets"" essentially trading for free.\n\nGoogle division easily worth $800 per share\n\nWith revenue growth around 20% and a forward PE of near 20 after accounting for the net cash on the balance sheet, the valuation is very reasonable (and this includes the losses from Other Bets). The secular growth in online advertising revenue is showing no signs of slowing down. The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) reported in their Internet Advertising Revenue Report that online advertising has increased at a 17% clip since 2005, and was up 20% YoY in 2015. Mobile ad growth is the primary reason for the recent acceleration.\n\nThe pace has kept up thus far in 2016. IAB reported in their Q3 2016 update that internet ad revenues climbed 20% YoY again in the quarter. Alphabet appears to be holding their market share, even with the surging Facebook, as they also announced similar revenue growth during the Q3 period.\n\nSurging internet ad revenue has come at the expense of the traditional media outlets, a trend expected to continue. Adding the broadcast and cable television lines together in the graph above you see that in 2015 internet ad revenue has caught up to television ad revenue. We will see internet ad revenue surpass broadcast and cable revenue for the first time in 2016.\n\nIn addition to being the most dominant player in search, Google has yet to seriously monetize their YouTube and Maps platforms, both of which have over one billion monthly users. Google is set up well to at least maintain their market share in fast growing interned advertising space, making a 20 P/E multiple look like a bargain.\n\nI love me some free options:\n\nWhile it is easier to illustrate why the downside at this price is limited for Alphabet, it is much harder to estimate a fair value. This is because the company has so many other bets spread around, each with option-like payoff profiles. What I mean by this is that the payoff on each investment is very similar to that of an out-of-the-money call option. The cost to acquire the option is small, but the most likely scenario is a loss of the capital invested. However, there is a small probability that payoff could be huge and uncapped. The more bets Alphabet makes into these potentially disruptive technologies and innovations, the more likely one of them turns into a home run. The payoffs of these bets are highly uncertain, but getting them for free is clearly a great value.\n\nAutonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, drone delivery, robotics and new forms of high-speed internet services are just a few examples of some of these other bets that could potentially yield high payoffs. Additionally, the venture capital arm could strike it rich with a timely investment in the next disruptive technology.\n\nThere are also plenty of bets going on inside of the Google division, which too are not properly valued in the share price. Of these, cloud services probably has the biggest potential. Google recently introduced Google Cloud as a new business unit that includes their collaboration and productivity applications, machine learning and data analytics tools, and application program interfaces. Google\'s access to vast amounts of data and their advancements and investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence should prove a compelling value proposition for cloud customers.\n\nRevenues from Google\'s cloud services are not broken out from the rest of Google revenues in their SEC filings, but management has indicated that cloud is growing quickly and that they are investing heavily. In Q3, Google other revenue (the line cloud rolls up under) was $2.4 billion, up 39% YoY with the growth explained on the earnings call as ""driven by Play and Cloud"" and that the cloud platform had the largest YoY growth of any revenue line.\n\nAnother signal from the earnings call that shows how much the company is investing in cloud is headcount growth, which grew 5% in Q3 alone, to 69,953. CFO Ruth Porat clarified that the ""vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud.""\n\nIf even a modest market share were eventually carved out in this fast growing and highly profitable space, the effect on the stock price could be quite large. In their semi-annual Public Cloud Customer Research report, TBR forecasts that the public cloud market will reach $167B by 2020. In the report TBR also estimates that Google cloud revenues were $2.8B in 2015, or roughly 3.4% of the market. Based on the clues from the earnings calls I think we can assume cloud revenues are currently growing at an over 50% annual rate for Google. While perhaps not the base case, it is not unfathomable that Google could carve out a 10% market share by 2020. Using the TBR market estimates, this would be $16.7 billion in revenue. Applying a price-to-sales multiple of 6 we could be looking at a $100 billion cloud business by 2020. This free option is hard to pass up.\n\n(SOURCE: TBR Public Cloud Customer Research report)\n\nKey Risks:\n\nWhile Alphabet has a lot of opportunities for growth in new markets outside of advertising, the advertising business is still the engine that allows the company the luxury of making so many investments in early stage technologies. While I believe the fundamentals for owning Alphabet as these levels is strong, a prudent investor should keep a careful eye on revenue growth and margins to make sure the core advertising cash flow engine stays healthy.\n\nRevenue : I\'d like to see advertising revenue continue to increase at a 15%-20% rate (before currency translation). The key metrics to monitor for advertising revenue are the aggregate change in paid clicks and the cost per click. Paid clicks has continued to trend up, rising 30% YoY in the first nine months of 2016. During the same period cost per click trended down 9%, likely due to increased competition from social media, a phenomenon seen across the industry. A slowdown in net advertising revenue growth below 15% in the next year would cause me to re-evaluate my thesis. Social media\'s share of internet ad spend also shouldn\'t be ignored, and warrants monitoring.\n\nI\'d like to see advertising revenue continue to increase at a 15%-20% rate (before currency translation).

These costs have been trending up, due mainly to the growing mix of mobile traffic. Higher traffic acquisition costs for mobile is primarily due to paying Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBuy Alphabet\'s core Google business right now at a fair price, which has it\'s own upside potential from the continued secular growth of online advertising and the under-monetization of the Maps and YouTube businesses.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock benefits from business diversification, continued innovation, increasing opex control, and a favorable valuation. However, Canaccord Genuity believes the single most important short-term metric is Websites revenue growth. In 2015, this metric accelerated from 13% to 20% and has remained above that point throughout 2016. Mobile search and YouTube are the two primary drivers of this, and Canaccord believes this dynamic has not run its course just yet.\n\nAdditionally, other parts of the non-core business (including Play, Cloud, and programmatic), should provide growth tailwinds beyond 2017. Canaccord continues to believe revenue growth can stay high, margins can expand modestly, and valuation has room to grow owing to multiple expansion. In the possible event that revenue growth slows to the low-double-digit range, Canaccord believes the earnings multiple can expand based on examining the long history of MSFT stock during a similar, multi-year transition.\n\nCanaccord believes the most important positive over the past 18 months has been the re-acceleration of Websites revenue growth, which progressed from 13% in Q2/15 to 16% in Q3 and 20% in Q4. It has stayed well above 20% so far this year and is an important psychological level for the stock. Despite lapping the addition of a third mobile search ad unit last quarter, Canaccord believes further innovations will extend growth, including tests of a fourth mobile ad unit and more robust adoption of PLAs.\n\nQualitatively, Canaccord observed that ad load expanded dramatically in 2015-2016. Canaccord also started noticing that skippable ads were being replaced by non-skippable more often. Quantitatively, Canaccord counts over 15 innovations and announcements for the YouTube service over the last two years. Canaccord believes this non-core unit is getting considerable attention in order to capture even more spend from TV.

Iyer, IFC Published : December 9, 2016\n\nNew Tailwinds for Google Stock\n\nAlthough we usually think of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) as a sprawling business, 99% of the company’s revenues are advertising-related. Google stock (GOOG) is almost entirely concentrated in this one sector, but that could change very soon.\n\nAfter years of research and development, Google is finally ready to package its self-driving program into an actual business. This would mean spinning the driverless project out of “Google X,” the experimental lab where the company tests out new ideas, into a newly formed entity. (Source: “Google’s self-driving car team is hiring executives as it prepares to spin out from Alphabet’s X,” Recode, December 7, 2016.)\n\nIf you ever wondered why Google reorganized itself into Alphabet, wonder no more.\n\nThese kinds of transitions are exactly why. In the founding letter, Google founder Larry Page wrote: “Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google.”\n\nBy Page’s telling, Google’s moonshot ideas would eventually outgrow the company, so the company needed room for them to breathe. Under the new structure, they could evolve into full companies and have their own chief executive officers, all of whom would still report to Page.\n\nThis is what we think is happening for the driverless car project.\n\nThe first rumblings came from the head of the project himself, John Krafcik, when he spoke at the Nikkei Innovation Forum in October. Krafcik was vague about the timeline, but he made it clear that driverless cars were going to “graduate” from Google X’s lab.\n\nNow we’re seeing conspicuous hires to the driverless car team. For instance, Kevin Vosen was hired as the project’s chief legal officer. To the layperson, this hiring looks harmless. But Google X already has lawyers. The new hire, skilled as he may be, is a duplicate that makes no sense.\n\nThat is, unless self-driving cars will become a new company under the Alphabet banner. Other recent additions to the Google workforce also seem redundant. Why else would they hire a second “head of real estate” if not to make sure that the new division was staffed properly?\n\nOnly one answer explains all of the above: Google’s autonomous car division is almost open for business.\n\nExisting carmakers like Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) have signed deals to license the driverless tech from Google, which is a clever way for Google to ride the autonomous car trend without the heavy costs of vehicle production.\n\nMoreover, the market seems ignorant of its effect on Google stock (GOOG). Investors still believe that self-driving cars are 20 or 30 years down the road, but the writing on the wall says otherwise.\n\nIf driverless cars truly graduate from Google X, it’s because Alphabet executives expect it to make a lot of money. With this potential growth not priced into Google stock (GOOG), I expect there to be enormous returns waiting for the patient tech investor.', 'Revenues from smart home hardware and services are poised to climb to highs of $83 billion this year, according to market research firm Juniper. The number could more than double to highs of $195 billion by 2021 according to the research firm given the rate at which various segments are gaining traction. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Samsung are poised to be the biggest beneficiaries of the expected growth given their investments in the fast-growing space.\n\nMarket Leaders\n\nHome automation and smart appliances continue to experience exponential growth driven by tech giants investing in them as the race for new opportunities for growth heats up. Google has already made an entry into the space with smart speakers and Google Home. Amazon’s Echo speaker is another smart home device that continues to dominate.\n\nSmart home hardware and services cover a gamut of categories including entertainment, healthcare automation and connected devices. It is for this reason that the fast emerging industry continues to attract investments from big tech companies that are looking for new opportunities for growth away from their core operations.\n\nGrowth Slowdown\n\nJuniper, however, expects the likes of Amazon, Apple, Samsung and Google to solidify their positions in smart home hardware given their already leading roles. The e-commerce giant for instance already boasts a robust cloud service that should give it an edge compared to other companies going forward\n\n“The company has managed to maximize its value proposition for Alexa by partnering with a large range of complementary players in the market, whilst utilizing its own cloud platform to set Echo and Alexa apart from its competitors in terms of functionality,“ Juniper said in a statement\n\nThe research firm has however warned that revenue growth in the most mature segment, which is smart entertainment, could slow from current levels as other segments gain traction. Smart appliance and home automation devices are slowly gaining traction. Entry of the likes of LittleBits, Notion and iVee into the 2 segments according to the research firm will fuel growth going forward.\n\nApple was unchanged in Tuesday trading session having rallied by 0.10% to close the day at $119.11 a share. Google on the other hand was down by $1.17 a share ending the day at lows of $826.01 a share.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.', 'Up until recently, mega-tech had been a bunch of sleeping giants but no longer. After lagging for a while, the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQ ) plowed into record territory this week. Strength came from the likes of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ). Others such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are also working on bullish setups.\n\nSource: Apple\n\nThe earnings season will undoubtedly make or break these set ups. An easy way to bet long this upside potential is with a blanket long position on the QQQ. But today I want to focus on AAPL based on a specific thesis — the Samsung (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) effect.\n\nYes, I know it’s been overly exposed. But I will share my personal experience to illustrate my thoughts.\n\nFor years, my household has sided with Samsung phones. Until we recently had a phone literally catch fire. In our efforts to fix the phone (and while dealing with the thousand hoops that were imposed upon us) we ended up switching phones makers and providers.\n\nThe point of the story is this: One out of the three new phones ended up being an iPhone 7. This wasn’t because we were shopping for it, but rather that it was suggested by the salesperson and offered free by the provider. Conclusion: AAPL will gain incremental business from Samsung regardless of who is shopping for what. It’s what they call “pin action.”\n\nFundamentally, I reiterate my statement that the AAPL machine will continue to offer an attractive stock value. But I have very little faith that Tim Cook is the right leader for it. What I do see attractive here is the technical upside potential. AAPL stock has the potential to retest the highs. The set up is available for the bulls.\n\nThe Trade: Buy AAPL Mar $120/$125 debit call spread. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $1.80 per contract. This is my maximum potential loss. If Apple stock rallies past my spread, I stand to double my money. Options are time sensitive, so the March contract allows 65 days to be proven right.\n\nIn this case, I want to hedge my bets by selling downside risk against AAPL value to lower my upside entry cost. I don’t do this, however, unless I believe in the value of AAPL stock against which I am selling risk.\n\n\n\nNext Page', 'By Mukta Samtani Published : January 11, 2017\n\nApple Stock (AAPL Stock) Is Looking Forward to a Game Changer\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been gaining ground of late, and AAPL stock is trading at around $119.00-plus levels now. As the company and its fans celebrate the 10th anniversary of the iconic “iPhone,” it is the right time to ponder what lies ahead for the company that has been defined by its smartphone.\n\nThere seems to be a clear problem ahead for the company, which was conspicuous by its absence from the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2017) trade show in Las Vegas.\n\nThis problem has been mentioned in a report from The Wall Street Journal, which explains how the company seems to be lagging behind in executing its vision for artificial intelligence (AI), specifically voice-based interfaces. (Source: “Why Apple’s Critics Are Right This Time,” The Wall Street Journal, January 8, 2017.)\n\nAI is important to the company, as this technology is most likely to disrupt Apple the same way that Apple disrupted the smartphone industry. AAPL stock has been riding high for too long on the phenomenal success of the iPhone.\n\nAI-powered voice assistants are capable of replacing interactions with mobile devices. It does not mean that screens will not be needed anymore. However, users will become more inclined to talk to objects that can listen and interact with them. This is what is behind the success of Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) voice-based assistant “Alexa.”\n\nApple appears to be way behind in this race, and this is not good for Apple stock going forward. Amazon’s Alexa was a huge hit at the just-concluded CES 2017. At that trade show, a number of companies announced their devices that would be powered by Alexa.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has also launched its “Pixel” smartphone that has “Google Assistant” running the show. Alphabet executives were also there at the CES 2017 tech show, where they unveiled a number of devices that would be run on with Google Assistant. AAPL stock came under pressure last year when the Pixel got better reviews than Apple’s “iPhone 7.”\n\nThe Challenge for Apple Stock in 2017\n\nContrast this with the way things have been running at Apple Inc. on the AI front. Apple’s “Siri” has been around for a longer time, but still could never grab the attention that its competitors have been able to command. The company has been on an acquisition spree to strengthen its presence in AI but still does not have a serious contender to Amazon, Alphabet, or even Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nAs investors look forward to the quarterly results of Apple Inc., the whole focus will be on what plans that management has to keep itself ahead in the consumer technology space.

Iyer, IFC Published : December 19, 2016\n\nGoogle Stock Outlook 2017\n\nMarkets have been on tenterhooks ever since Google morphed into Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG). Investors were confused about what it meant for GOOG stock, but everything is becoming clear. We can now say why it happened, and what it means for Google stock in 2017.\n\nBut before we go further, here’s a taste of what’s in store for the Google stock price in 2017:\n\nA new business segment potentially worth tens of billions of dollars. A new service that could be as popular as “Android.” A new device that could be bigger than the “iPhone.”\n\nEach of the above represents a “trigger point” for Google stock. When a new technology or product reaches its critical mass, the “trigger point” fires, propelling the share price skywards.\n\nYou’ll recognize it when you see it. One second there will be calm; the next, every two-bit investor is scrambling to buy the same stock. It’s herd mentality, plain and simple. The market is phenomenal at ignoring emerging technologies until the last possible moment.\n\nBut the moment those technologies become undeniable, investors become rabid.\n\nWe can lay out a time frame when these events could come to pass, but obviously trying to forecast the exact moment of a trigger point is a fool’s errand. No one has a magic 8-ball.\n\nAnyone who tells you that they know exactly when something will happen is either a liar or a fool.\n\nSteer clear of those charlatans. Think in terms of the next decade. What technologies are going to explode in popularity? Which company is best positioned to exploit that popularity? Once you know the answers to those questions, you can sit back and relax.\n\nThe rest happens like clockwork.\n\nLet me give you an example. In the fall of 2015, there was mounting excitement about new technologies like virtual reality (VR) and self-driving cars. A lot of analysts were bullish on the potential of these devices, as they should have been. Both technologies are going to be huge.\n\nBut most of them missed a crucial connection. Both driverless cars and VR devices had something in common: they both require advanced graphics cards. Self-driving cars need to understand the world around them, and that requires graphics cards.\n\nLikewise, VR needs to give you the impression of being submerged in a digital world. That also requires excellent graphics cards. We saw that connection. We understood its importance and, more to the point, we understood which company was best positioned to win that industry: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n\nSince that time, NVDA stock has tripled in value. It shot up 204% in the 12 months since we turned bullish on the graphics card maker. But here’s the best part: both driverless cars and VR haven’t reached their “trigger points” yet; these gains were just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nBut what does all this have to do with our Google stock forecast 2017? Let me explain…\n\n#1 “Trigger Point” for Google Stock Outlook 2017\n\nEarlier in this article, I mentioned—or rather hinted at—three trigger points which could send GOOG stock surging in 2017. I also mentioned two questions that needed answering:\n\nWhat technologies are going to explode in popularity over the next decade? Which company is best positioned to exploit that popularity?\n\nBased on extensive research (and conversations with industry insiders), we have identified three tech trends that are closing in on their “trigger points.”\n\nAs for the second question, the answer seems a little obvious. We clearly believe that Google stock will profit from these “trigger points,” or else we would have chosen a different stock to feature in this article.\n\nBut now let’s get into the details. The first of our three “trigger points” is an emerging technology trend which has slipped under the radar: Healthcare. I know what you’re thinking—what could a technology company do to impact the healthcare industry?\n\nAs it turns out, there’s a lot that a tech company can do for advancing diagnostic treatments. In this case, Google is making use of a company it acquired in 2014. The company, DeepMind Technologies Limited, was focused on “deep learning algorithms” and “neural networks.”\n\nYou may know those terms better by their more common name: Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nThere are a lot of companies hopping on the AI bandwagon, but Google has the cleverest strategy. It has embedded AI software into a range of healthcare apps that will help doctors detect diseases quicker and with greater accuracy. The potential for GOOG stock is amazing.\n\nImagine if you go in for a routine checkup at your doctor’s office. They do a few scans, the doctor barely glances at them, and then he sends you on your merry way. Fast forward a few years. You’re in for another routine physical, but this time they diagnose you with acute kidney injury.\n\nEven with the best doctors that money can buy, there’s no guarantee that anyone could have predicted your affliction. So it’s not exactly the doctor’s fault. But that doesn’t help your situation.\n\nGoogle thinks that artificial intelligence (AI)—or “deep learning algorithms,” to be more accurate—can help solve this problem. Its app basically churns through millions of kidney scans. Eventually it begins to understand how the disease evolves, which helps predict diseases earlier on.\n\nDoes it sound too good to be true? Well, apparently the National Health Service in the U.K. doesn’t think so. It is already using the app to catch early acute kidney injury. (Source: “NHS to use Google DeepMind AI app to help treat patients,” Engadget, November 22, 2016.)\n\nIt was a relatively small piece of news, so it hasn’t seeped into the Google stock price yet. However, the additional revenue from healthcare institutions could send GOOG stock skyrocketing in 2017.\n\nThe “trigger point” is all that’s left.\n\n#2 “Trigger Point” for Google Stock Outlook 2017\n\nThe second major catalyst for Google stock is self-driving cars. Autonomous vehicles. Driverless tech. Whatever you call it, this trend is fast approaching its “trigger point.” Just look at the search traffic for the keyword “autonomous car”:\n\nChart courtesy of Google Trends\n\nAs you can see, interest in self-driving technology jumped dramatically over the last five years. This isn’t an accident. Companies like Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Uber Technologies, Inc. have made some high-profile investments into driverless technology.\n\nBut they weren’t the first. Google was the real pioneer of self-driving technology.\n\nMore to the point, Google is in a better position to win than Tesla or Uber. Rather than spending a bunch of cash on building cars. Google is just licensing the tech to existing manufacturers, much like it did with the Android operating system. (Source: “Google and Fiat agree to build a driverless minivan,” The Telegraph, May 3, 2016.)\n\nWhen the smartphone wars reached their peak, Google didn’t just try to build its own hardware. It developed an open-source platform that other manufacturers could build on top of. It was a brilliant move that paid huge dividends. GOOG stock price has more than doubled since.\n\nLikewise, big automakers—like Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) and Toyota Motor Corp (ADR) (NYSE:TM)—have already agreed to license driverless tech from Google.\n\nBased on the success of Android, Google stock could be in for a huge tailwind once driverless tech has its “trigger point.” That scratches number two off our list, leaving us with one more “trigger point” to explore.\n\n#3 “Trigger Point” for Google Stock Outlook 2017\n\nVirtual reality is the third and final “trigger point” for GOOG stock. The technology is inching its way towards critical mass but, at present, only hardcore gamers and tech junkies have bought a VR system. That could soon change, much to the benefit of Google stock price.\n\nOlder and less tech-savvy consumers aren’t familiar with VR. To many of them, it sounds like science fiction. But rest assured that VR devices aren’t a thing of the distant future—they are available through Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and in Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) stores around the country.\n\nYou can strap on one of these headsets and fall into another world. As someone who owns a VR headset, take it from me: this device is phenomenal. It is like nothing else you have ever experienced, which is why Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) estimates a potential market size at $80.0 billion.\n\nMy only complaint is the limited amount of content.\n\nThink about it: customers aren’t willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for a device when there are only a handful of games or movies to watch. They’d rather wait until more content is developed.\n\nThe good news is they won’t have to wait long. Production studios are tripping over each other to establish a foothold in the VR market. All of them know that VR devices could be bigger than the iPhone was in its heyday, so they experimented with new “VR experiences.”\n\nGoogle is taking full advantage of its monstrous size in the VR world. Its first product was an inexpensive VR headset called “Cardboard.” It was exactly what it sounds like: a cardboard foldout headset that you put together and attach to your smartphone. It cost only $20.00.\n\nUnlike its competitors, Google knew that customers were skittish about VR. So it gave them a low-risk option with “Cardboard.” If customers didn’t take well to VR, big deal. What’s $20.00 in the grand scheme of things? By contrast, competitors were selling VR gear for $600.00 to $1,600.\n\nBut excitement for VR is building. The technology is speeding toward its “trigger point” and Google knows it. In response to renewed interest in VR, the company has unveiled the “Daydream,” a high-quality VR viewer.\n\nGranted, at $100.00 per unit, Daydream is more expensive than Cardboard, but customers are more familiar with VR now. They have access to more content and improved quality, so it makes sense for them to shell out the cash.\n\nMoreover, this makes sense from a business standpoint. Google is ramping up its product offerings alongside the VR trend. This way, GOOG stock could be perfectly positioned when VR has its “trigger point.”\n\nIn summary: Google stock is on the cusp of extraordinary gains. This stock has already gleaned enormous returns for investors, but VR, autonomous cars, and AI could send GOOG stock soaring in 2017.', ""In addition to being omnipresent in the online search world, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has found another way of being useful in an individual's daily life. Early last month, the tech giant launched the Google Home product with aims to serve as a voice-activated speaker powered by the company’s Google Assistant.\n\nRecently, Google Home also added a few more actions into its home assistant’s arsenal.\n\n(Google)\n\nEarnings performance\n\nOn Oct. 27, Alphabet delivered its third quarter fiscal 2016 results. The tech giant delivered strong 19.7% sales growth to $64.2 billion and 23.8% profit growth to $14.1 billion nine months into its fiscal 2016 operations. This an amazing level of profitability considering that Alphabet’s operational expenses grew by 18.8% in the period.\n\n“We had a great third quarter, with 20% revenue growth year on year, and 23% on a constant currency basis. Mobile search and video are powering our core advertising business and we’re excited about the progress of newer businesses in Google and Other Bets,” said Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet’s shares remained almost flat, or 0.27% the following day, while the broader Standard & Poor 500 index closed down by 0.31%.\n\nValuations\n\nAccording to GuruFocus data, Alphabet’s class A shares had a trailing 12-month PE ratio of 29.6 times (higher than 50% of its peers), PB ratio of 4 times (lower than 61% of its peers) and PS ratio of 6.59 times (lower than 79% of its peers). The company does not provide dividends.\n\nMarket performance\n\nAlphabet underperformed the market year-to-date with 4% versus 12.8%. Meanwhile, the company’s class A shares outperformed the market with 17% total return versus 15.56% on a five-year total return basis.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet was founded in October 2015 and serves as a parent company of Google. In its filing, Alphabet is a collection of businesses, of which the largest is Google. The company also includes businesses that combine as Other Bets, such as the Verily, Calico, X, Nest, GV, Google Capital and Access/Google Fiber.\n\nAlphabet generates its revenues mostly by delivering cost-effective and relevant online advertising to its consumers. Alphabet generated 90%, or $67 billion, of its total Google segment revenues from advertising in fiscal 2015.\n\nAlphabet derived most of its business from the U.S., at 46% of the company’s total 2015 sales. Google's core products such as Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Google Play and Gmail each have over one billion monthly active users. These core business operations by Alphabet are immensely admirable as it could possibly produce a bottomless cash flow.\n\n(Research and development expenditures, 10-K and 10-Q)\n\nAlphabet, nonetheless, guarantees its shareholders that it will not become complacent and rest on its laurels. The company dedicates a huge amount of its sales in research and development expenditures alone, $12.3 billion or 16% of its gross sales in fiscal 2015.\n\nAlphabet has two reported segments: Google and Other Bets.\n\n(10-Q and 10-K)\n\nGoogle\n\nThe Google segment includes Alphabet’s main internet products such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Apps, Cloud, Android, Chrome and Google Play. The Google segment also includes hardware products the company sells, such as Chromecast, Chromebooks, Nexus and the recently launched Virtual Reality products.\n\nIn 2015, the Google segment grew 13.5% to $74.5 billion and delivered an operating margin of 31.4%. Nine months into fiscal 2016, the segment grew 19.3% year-on-year and had remarkably the same margin as the previous year.\n\nOther Bets\n\nAccording to Alphabet, the Other Bets segment is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Other Bets includes businesses such as Access/Google Fiber, Calico, Nest, Verily, GV, Google Capital, X and other initiatives.\n\nIn 2015, Other Bets segment grew 37% to $448 million and delivered an operating loss of $3.57 billion, markedly several times greater than the revenue it generated. Nine months into fiscal 2016, the segment grew 85.4% and delivered an operating loss of $2.5 billion, compared to $2.25 billion the year before.\n\nOverall, Alphabet had five-year sales and profit growth averages of 20.7% and 13.96%, respectively.\n\nOwnership\n\nAlphabet has three different classes of shares, class A, B and C. The company’s class A common stock, or ticker GOOGL, has one vote per share, class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and class C capital stock, ticker GOOG, has no voting rights.\n\nAs of December 2015, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt owned approximately 92.5% of Alphabet’s outstanding Class B common stock, which translated into a 58.5% combined voting power in the company.\n\n(CNN Money)\n\nAs observed, there has been a minimal deviation in either the class A or class C share price over time.\n\nCash, debt and book value\n\nAs of Sept. 30, Alphabet had $83 billion in cash and $3.9 billion in debt, indicating a debt-equity ratio of 0.03.

Many experts believe that the main aim of the search engine giant behind this move is to create traction among the users to buy its Nexus and Pixel devices.\n\nSubsequently, the new feature has been implemented as part of Google Play services 10.2. Hence, it is worth mentioning that those who are still using the previous version Android OS on their Nexus and Pixel devices need to update this feature to benefit from it. Also, the move indicates that the search engine giant is trying to position itself as a dominant force in the tech ecosystem by offering improved and new features to its users.\n\nMany reports indicate that with the new feature users of Pixel and Nexus devices can automatically set-up a new tethering connection without making any particular settings. Also, the feature helps users to connect its devices that are associated with Google account, making it easier for the users to stay online even when the connection drops. To be more specific, when the Internet connection drops, the phone will ask it users whether they want to tether to another device that is associated with their Google account or not.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that this feature is not available to all the Android devices as users are required to update their Google Play Services to the latest version. Also, the feature is currently limited to Google devices only. However, many tech gurus believe that this feature will soon see the light for other Android devices as well. In any case, it is yet to see whether users will appreciate this feature as Google is expecting.', 'Published By: Ken Bock on January 23, 2017 11:57 am EST\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) plans to roll out “Instant Tethering” along with Google Play Services 10.2. Users who have already received the new addition said that this has allowed them to connect to devices using the same Google account without a connection, which is, in a way, the evolution of Wi-Fi hotspot.\n\nUsers will no longer need to turn on Wi-FI hotspot by touching the phone; things would be easier thanks to Instant Tethering. With one main Google account, users would be able to connect easily to other devices. The feature will work via Bluetooth; if users are not able to log onto Wi-Fi, a pop-up will automatically show up which will ask them if they would like to back online through their cellular Internet connection. With one tap on the connect button, they will be able to use the Internet on any other device around them.\n\nInstant tethering will not need additional information from users to set up. Unluckily, this handy feature is not available for all Android users at the moment. In some cases, it might not even appear if users do not have the updated version of Google Play Services. Owners of the tech giant’s Pixel and Nexus phones can enjoy this feature, which are running the latest version of Android Nougat 7.1.1. as it will first come to those devices.\n\nKeep your fingers crossed as this feature might just come to other Android-powered devices and the company does not keep it exclusive to its house products. Andreas Proschofsky, Editor at German publication derstandard.at made a post on Google+ which read: “Google Play Services 10.2 has started to roll out and it’s introducing a pretty nifty new feature: Instant tethering.

In the end, it’s all about what a stock does that matters. In the case of this particular stock, the chart tells quite a story at present.\n\nGOOGL has been trading in a bearish trend, based on the relative levels of its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This suggests that the broad sum of capital flow in the stock has been generally negative over the recent period. In terms of the relative level of interest afforded this stock among active participants in the market, relative volume measures have been weak, indicating apathy for the name by traders, investors, and money managers during the past month of action. This suggests something of the significance of other current technical measures as well.\n\nFor market timers, it’s also important to take measure of the relative level of recent lift or pressure in the stock is it overbought or oversold? For that, we turn to RSI and stochastic measures. The 14-day RSI stands at 62.31%. That shows that the stock, according to a traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI indicator, is not particularly predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure If we look at the stochastic measure, the raw data over the stock’s last month of action shows a score of 88.49%. Based on a raw data interpretation, the stock is relatively overbought from this perspective.\n\nIt should be noted that the overall volatility in the stock is worth gauging as well. In recent action, GOOGL has made a move of +40.46 over the past month. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by -0.66%, and it’s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. The stock’s recent movement has come on a historical volatility score of 13.81%, which represents the standard deviation of returns of a theoretical long position from a mean price during that period. On a daily basis over the past month, the average true range of the stock, as expressed in percentage terms, is 1.4%. That should give you a pretty good sense of the level of risk implied in a short-term trading approach in the stock with a stop-loss in place.\n\nAs it stands at present, the stock might find important action at key Fibonacci levels. Fibonacci levels are used by major Wall Street firm technical desks. The math is drawn from the Fibonacci series that defines growth systems by an interval increase characterized by steps divisible by the “golden ratio” of 61.8%. In this case, the critical 38.2% level drawn off the 52-weeklow of $672.66 sits at $744.61. GOOGL also has additional support below at the stock’s 200-day simple moving average, which sits at $777.51.', 'Vetr lowered shares of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from a strong-buy rating to a buy rating in a report issued on Monday morning.

However, Google\'s search results still point to year-old stories touting Google briefly surpassing Apple in market cap twice last spring.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle\'s old results haven\'t been accurate for months\n\n\n\n\n\nApple valuation up, P/E still very low\n\nThe massive over-valution of surveillance based advertising\n\nFacebook\'s market cap ($389.23 billion) is almost half as large as Apple\'s despite achieving quarterly revenues that are close to a tenth of Apple\'s ($78.4 billion)\n\nIf you search Google for ""apple google valuation,"" the search giant\'s primary ""featured snippet"" answer is supplied from a year old Quartz blog entry by Melvin Backman, who portrayed the event (last February 1) as the ""New Normal,"" rather than a passing moment of irrationality in the market. Apple passed up again Google within a couple weeks of that being written.If you click Google\'s suggested ""People Also Ask"" question for ""Is Google or Apple worth more?"" the answer it gives is derived from an article published by CNBC last May, when Google shares again briefly passed Apple\'s. However, for most of the past year since, Apple\'s market cap has hovered about $40 billion on top of Google.This month, Apple\'s shares jumped significantly following its earnings report from the December quarter, boosted by strong sales of iPhones and Macs, as well as the 18 percent growth of its Services business that\'s now achieving quarterly revenues of $7.17 billion.The tech media narrative from last year that decried a shrinking smartphone market and imagined a "" boring iPhone 7 "" helped to suppress Apple\'s stock price, but that story couldn\'t withstand the real sales numbers achieved at the release of new iPhones and MacBook Pros, as well as record sales of Apple Watch and Services including App Store sales and Apple Music.Despite the increase in Apple\'s share price, the company still trades at a Price/Earnings ratio of 16.36, far lower than Google\'s 29.32. In other words, the market is still putting a much larger valuation on Google\'s ability to make money than Apple\'s, despite the fact that Apple continues to earn more money and successfully launch products that Google continues to fail at.That\'s particularly visible in smartphones with the Google Pixel, which did little for Google nor its hardware partner HTC. But Google has also stumbled in wearables, tablets and laptops, indicating an strong inability to take Apple\'s business away at will, despite many years and trying many different strategies.Google\'s $26.06 billion in total revenues during the December quarter (and $5.5 billion in quarterly net income) were significantly lower than Apple\'s $78.35 billion in quarterly revenues (and $17.89 billion in net income).However, more attention was directed to the idea that Apple earns most of its profits from a single family of products (iPhones) than the fact that virtually all of Google\'s profits come from surveillance based advertising. That\'s a market that is not only facing strong competition from players including Facebook, but is also at risk from ad blocking and a general user dissatisfaction with being tracked and sold to advertisers.Apple\'s $7.17 billion from its Services unit alone approaches the revenue of all of Facebook ($8.81 billion), but Facebook shares trade at a P/E of 38.99, meaning Facebook\'s market cap ($389.23 billion) is almost half as large as Apple\'s despite achieving quarterly revenues that are close to a tenth of Apple\'s ($78.4 billion).Like Google, Facebook also has a business model that depends almost entirely upon ads, and that faces real competition from both the incumbent Google and encroaching new players including Snap. Unlike Apple, Facebook and Google have no entry into the Chinese market, and little potential to enter it.Apple\'s luxury electronics and proprietary app development platforms are unrivaled on a global level, and Apple is the only company with strong market share in both the U.S. and China, the world\'s two largest markets for smartphones and related products.', 'Google (or Alphabet, if you prefer) has long been plagued with a problem with its advertising business: while the number of ads people are clicking on has been growing, the value of those ads has been constantly dropping. Google has always excelled at showing the best ads against a search result, but that business may not last forever as the way people interact with technology starts to change rapidly.\n\nThat’s all fine as long as Google can keep those clicks growing and coming along, but as we’ve seen in the case of Apple’s smartphone market share topping out, there are only so many eyeballs to get ads in front of people. And for now, it might be able to keep its stock price in a good place. Google has to keep padding those impressions, or get creative around the way it advertises to its users. Wall Street, as usual, is looking for growth — especially in the largest companies in the world. Apple has more or less been punished (or at least, not rewarded) for its slowing smartphone sales and so far lack of dramatic new growth engines.\n\nAnd that’s just what the company has been doing. This year, Google unveiled two major new hardware products: the Pixel smartphone and the voice-driven living room assistant Google Home (in addition to a few smaller launches like Google Wifi and an updated Chromecast dongle). These more or less fit into the vision of getting people to engage with Google’s search engine in some active way with the hope that if Google figures out how to get it right, it’ll be able to monetize it down the line.\n\nWhether that will convince Wall Street that Google is able to get beyond the search engine by diversifying its touch points — whether that’s voice, phone, VR or any other new interactive medium — is still yet to be seen. Google’s core competency has always been advertising, and while it might be able to build a business on cloud services (as we’ve seen with Amazon is becoming very successful) or new hardware, Google still has so much data that if it can figure out next-generation advertising products on new mediums it might have a new fantastic growth story for Wall Street.\n\nIt needed to at least show that intent to Wall Street. A healthy stock price — and also a story about innovation and looking forward — is important to keep attracting the best talent. Google’s problems are some of the hardest in tech, and it needs to be able to tell a story to not only investors but prospective employees that they can work on those hard problems and also be well-compensated for doing so.\n\nGoogle is trying to flex the power of its machine learning algorithms, which given the data it has may arguably be the most powerful in the world. That helps Google understand complex queries from products like the Google Assistant — and get people to stick to Google’s voice interface versus Apple’s. Amazon exposed latent demand for a voice-driven interface with the Amazon Echo, and Google is essentially hoping to perfect the experience.\n\nAs such, while Google has shown that its advertising business isn’t so challenged, it’s showing that it’s already looking toward the future. And that’s been largely reflected in the company’s share price from Wall Street. Despite some bumps in the road, Google at the very least looks on track to hold steady or end the year up a bit from where it was around a year ago today:\n\nAll of Google’s efforts to figure out what the next-generation “search” interface will be will have to eventually play out. The way it works is this: Google’s paid clicks are going up, but the cost-per-click — which is the key metric Wall Street is looking at when it’s looking at the health of Google’s business — is still on the decline. That’s because mobile ads are generally less valuable than the company’s desktop search ads.\n\nHere’s a look at the decline, from the company’s last earnings report:\n\nAnd meanwhile, the paid clicks, also from the last earnings report:\n\nSo, if Google’s core business is eventually at risk of a slowdown, or decline, where does it go from here?\n\nGoogle has shown clear signs that it’s trying to diversify its revenue. Perhaps the largest indicator was the hiring of Diane Green and the ramping up of its cloud services tools in an attempt to challenge Amazon, whose AWS business is rapidly becoming a huge growth engine for Amazon without the excessive costly fiscal baggage of its retail business. Amazon unveiled a huge number of updates to its AWS service earlier this year — including literally driving a truck to your office to put your info into the cloud — and Google is going to be playing catch-up for a while. But, clearly, it’s trying to show Wall Street that it’s more than a search engine.\n\nThere’s also its increasing number of updates to its online productivity — which also puts it in competition with Microsoft. It’s also competing with Microsoft through both its cloud services and productivity tools, which Microsoft will never let you forget. And Apple is rapidly trying to ramp up its own services, regularly pointing to the success of things like Apple Music, in order to show Wall Street that it isn’t just a hardware company and can level the playing ground against companies looking to be a combo of hardware and software like Microsoft or google.\n\nAnd that’s also why there’s a whole section devoted to Google’s “other bets” in its earnings reports, though they haven’t shown themselves to be dramatically successful yet. Google’s core growth engine has been its search ads, but it’s also been known for its “Google X” labs, where it experiments on anything from network fiber to balloons and self-driving cars.\n\nAlphabet — through its CFO Ruth Porat — has been clear that it wants to be more judicious about the way it invests in these other bets. It’s all fine to invest in experimental projects like Fiber and self-driving cars, but if there isn’t a clear path to revenue, the company is going to have to figure out whether or not to move on to the next project and where to devote its resources. Alphabet may be one of the most valuable companies in the world, but even then it still only has so much runway and faces the constant threat from other companies emerging with experimental projects that could be runaway successes (the most obvious threat being the Amazon Echo).\n\nIf you wanted any evidence as to how absolutely tiny Google’s bets are for now, here’s a chart for you:\n\nGoogle saw the demand that Alexa tapped, and it is now looking to essentially smash Alexa — and Siri — with its own assistant powered by machine learning. And there’s a good bet it’ll work. Google has collected data for years and years on how people use the Internet, what kinds of questions they ask a search engine, and where they travel around after those questions have been asked. Google at a very fundamental level has a pretty good understanding of how we tick, and every time you use its services, it gets smarter and smarter. That’s why Google is constantly trying to bury its own interfaces within everything it does.\n\nSure, Google has a large portfolio of services that it can still throw ads up against. And that, at least for now, is something that can add a lot of value for its investors and keep the ship steady for a while. It has Gmail, with more than a billion users. It has one of the largest browsers in Chrome. In fact, it has a wide portfolio of services with a billion users or more. But those are not Google’s key revenue drivers, and Google has to show that it can keep growing revenue if it’s going to keep Wall Street off its back.\n\nThere’s a barrier that Google still has to overcome: while it is constantly learning, refining, improving and helping its users figure out what they are looking for, it also has to do so in a manner that doesn’t seem creepy. Google wants you to be constantly wired to the Internet — whether that’s through your phone, your voice or the way you move throughout the physical world. Google wants to tap your experience through everything from a screen to a virtual reality experience in the case of Daydream. And the company is aggressively spending in order to expand into all of those areas.\n\nApple still has an ace in the hole. It’s trying to roll out its own wireless earbuds that will give you Siri in your ear and, in theory, because of its proprietary technology it’ll be able to control the entire experience and make it uniquely Apple-y. Like Google, Apple is trying to figure out what kind of user experience looks like beyond the phone. Alexa and Google Home are in the living room, Google Assistant is talking to your phone, but the Airpods and Siri are a sort of wild card that we don’t know how it will play out yet.\n\nIn short, Google hasn’t cleared the way and gotten away from its existential crises. As long as those paid clicks keep going up, it’ll be able to keep the runway and hopefully figure out how to apply its strong machine learning capabilities to wherever users are drifting to next. And then once it gets people comfortable talking to, or clicking around, on their controlled user experience it can figure out how to monetize them the way it knows best — through advertisements.\n\nAlphabet’s opportunity is very big. For a moment earlier this year, Alphabet was the most valuable company in the world. In the face of slumping hardware sales, Apple clearly showed the risk that comes with focusing on a business beyond simply hardware, and that for growth it’s important to have a revenue base that exists as a collection of software and hardware. That’s what Google is looking for, with the unifying component being whatever search looks like after people are no longer using a search bar. And it’s a new story for Wall Street that just might work.\n\nFeatured Image: Jeff Chiu/AP', 'Internet giant Alphabet Inc.

That system is open-source and offered for customization to the car maker’s tastes, even comprising support for Android Auto and CarPlay. Many car-makers believe their infotainment user interface is an extension of the car make itself, which makes customizability enormously vital.\n\n“With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android’s features and ecosystem of applications,” said Chris Barman, FCA’s head of electrical engineering, in a statement.\n\nFurthermore if car-maker firms can save time and cash developing infotainment systems on top of Android, particularly with a pre-existing Android app ecosystem, the platform could takeoff. However it faces rivalry both from advanced platforms divisions within carmakers like Audi’s virtual cockpit as well as other podiums like BlackBerry’s QNX.\n\nAs most cars infotainment systems are quite hard to use, just about anything that can make them better is a must-have. Both Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) and Alphabet (GOOG) didn’t announced the exact date when exactly this planned platform will hit the shelves.', 'Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nAlphabet Inc.

I\'ve played the game and while it\'s fun putting a target on the DOW (NYSEARCA:DIA) or S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), most will prove wrong when we ring in 2018.\n\nIn the days and weeks ahead you\'re going to hear bullish predictions that seem out of touch with reality to perma-bears predicting a massive correction or bear market. If you keep saying the same thing over and over again, eventually you\'ll be right.\n\nLet me put that on the back burner for the moment and focus on what professionals are really talking about.\n\nWill it be Macro or Micro events that drive the bulk of 2017 returns?\n\nThe above is a conversation taking place at financial institutions around the world. Will it be a geopolitical event or a series of them that drive markets from Risk On to Risk Off and back again? Or, will we finally get back to traditional money management focused on fundamental returns and economic outcomes?\n\nPost the financial crisis, investor performance was largely driven by central bank policy both here and abroad. Fixed income and stocks were in strong bull markets with central bank policies around the world supporting both.\n\nPay no attention to the man (or woman) behind the curtain\n\n\n\n\n\nSure, we had the occasional geopolitical setback with a terrorist attack or currency crisis causing the hiccup. But in the end, it was central bank policy that ruled the day. Post the crisis Bernanke, Yellen, Draghi and Kuroda all took turns playing the Wizard or man behind the curtain. The only thing that mattered was if central banks were accommodative and how much.\n\nLast week\'s meeting confirmed what we already knew. The Fed, after a long delay has changed course raising the Fed Funds rate for the second time in a decade. We\'ll have to wait and see if the captain\'s order came in time but I suspect that the long overdue process of monetary policy handing the baton to fiscal policy has begun.\n\nOf course, the process has started but is no guarantee that fiscal proposals actually become working policy in the months and years ahead.\n\nI\'m very encouraged many of the economic proposals discussed by the incoming administration will help drive GDP. However, I\'ve been in this job long enough to understand that there is a huge economic divide between rhetoric and policy. Political compromise has been with us since the dawn of the Republic and I suspect will be a driving force in the years ahead.\n\nInflection Point\n\n2016 may prove to be an inflection point for markets and maybe for management styles as well. It\'s pretty clear this was the year that Growth (NYSEARCA:IVW) finally gave up the thrown to Value (NYSEARCA:IVE). For the last several years investors have been crowded into a handful of stocks still exhibiting secular growth and willing to pay almost anything for the privilege. While I believe most of the FANG stocks Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will perform well, I doubt it will be to the exclusion of all others.\n\nWhile much has been made of the fact that Value has trounced Growth since Election Day, the peak for this trade really took place at the end of last year.\n\nAnother changing dynamic was the rise in rates along with Financials (NYSEARCA:XLF) coming months before the election beginning just after BREXIT in June. The great rotation has likely begun with bond bears like Jeff Gundlach taking a victory lap.\n\nEven with the obvious headwinds for fixed income there are titanic forces in place to prevent a complete collapse of U.S. bonds. On a relative basis, they may not be attractive especially against stocks with dividends close to ten year rates but when compared to international sovereign counterparts, they look like a home run.\n\nConsumer Staples Still at Risk?\n\nThe rotation that should continue is out of Consumer Staples (NYSEARCA:XLP) with dividends only somewhat higher than the index while offering little or no organic growth. Coca Cola (NYSE:KO), and many of the food companies fall into that basket. Short of potential M&A activity I find it difficult to make a case for the sector. Shorts, may have as tough time as longs with bankers focused on combining slow growth companies looking for synergies to reduce costs and increase shareholder return. (Expect more mergers in this sector)\n\nWhile central bank policy may slowly be moving to the sidelines investors still have the inevitable geopolitical challenges to endure. Most will prove transitory creating opportunity but some will force us to change course.\n\nMy Prediction\n\nI\'m going to approach the challenge this way. Like any pilot, I look at weather reports before stepping into the plane knowing full well that any forecast is no guarantee of clear skies. I may be forced to change course even altering my destination.\n\nHere\'s my prediction. I\'m going to work as hard as I can, as long as I can to get the best investment outcome for investors. I know full well that some of these decisions will be right and some will be wrong.\n\nThere\'s only one thing worse than being wrong, ""It\'s Staying Wrong!""\n\nHappy Holidays everyone.\n\n*At the time of this article funds managed by David Nelson were long $GOOGL, $FB & $SPY\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are long SPY, FB, GOOGL.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it.

This marks the second project that the Mountain View, Calif.-based company has exited in less than a week.\n\nAnd that\'s not the end of it. The company\'s robot division, Boston Dynamics, is on the block for a sale, while it has also instituted cuts to Google X, the company\'s division for wild ideas.\n\nGoogle\'s moves are a sobering about-turn for a company famous for its moonshots. The decision to rein them in is part of the company\'s renewed focus on paring down costs after the arrival of former Morgan Stanley CFO Ruth Porat. They are also proof that the company\'s zeal to reinvent entire industries may have hit a reality roadblock. (See also: How Alphabet Inc. Reworked Its Letters This Year.)\n\nThe following is a list of industries that Google has pulled out of or applied the brakes on in the past couple of years.\n\nAugmented Reality (Google Glass)\n\nThe augmented reality glasses made a splash when they were first launched back in 2013. The device essentially consisted of a pair of glasses connected to the Internet and fitted with a camera that enabled wearers to browse the net and take photographs at the same time. However, even extravagant photo spreads in fashion magazines could not dim privacy concerns related to the device. They never caught on in mainstream society, and in 2015, Google closed the Explorer program associated with the device.\n\nBroadband (Google Fiber)\n\nKansas City made headlines in 2011 when it was selected to become the first city to receive Google Fiber. Subsequently, 12 more cities were added to the list of cities with Google\'s high-speed Internet broadband service. In October last year, the company announced a halting of expansion to new cities and cut down staff for the unit.\n\nBased on reports, the unit was responsible for a majority of the $280 million capital expenditures related in Alphabet\'s ""Other Bets"" division. But the company’s CFO Ruth Porat reminded investors in a quarterly call that the company still has a broadband presence in 18 cities (in addition to the Webpass acquisition). She said the company was pausing expansion for ""exploratory discussions"" and to ""integrate technology work."" (See also: Google Halts Expansion Of Fiber Project.)\n\nSatellite Imaging (Terra Bella)\n\nWhen Google bought Skybox Imaging (the division\'s earlier name) for $500 million in 2014, it wanted to use the startup\'s technology for Google Maps and to spread Internet access in remote regions of the world. Two years later, however, the company seems to have rethought that mission and is reported to be in talks to sell the division off to a competitor in exchange for an equity stake. (See also: Alphabet in Talks to Sell Satellite Imaging Startup.)\n\nRobotics (Boston Dynamics)\n\nGoogle acquired Boston Dynamics in 2013 for an undisclosed sum and established a robotics division called Replicant in 2014. It released viral videos about life with robots earlier this year. However, the robotics unit is said to be up for sale after senior executives concluded that the unit will not be making money, at least for the next couple of years. The move also represents a possible end to Google\'s foray into robotics. According to a Bloomberg report last year, there is no longer a separate robotics division within Google. (See also: Why Alphabet Is Looking to Sell Its Robotics Unit.)', 'In 2014, Google and Facebook Inc. vied to acquire Titan Aerospace, a maker of high-altitude, solar-powered drones. Google won the bidding, so Facebook purchased its own company, which was building a huge glider called Aquila.\n\nThe idea was to beam internet access from the sky to get more people logging on from remote places to access information and probably use both companies’ web services. That soaring vision has come down to Earth with a bump.\n\nOn Wednesday, a spokeswoman from Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s X research lab said it had shut down Titan. This happened in early 2016, she said, although confirmation didn’t come until earlier today, when technology blog 9to5Google reported the move.\n\nThe team from Titan was brought into X in late 2015, and the research lab ended its exploration of high-altitude drones for internet access shortly after, the X spokeswoman said in a statement.\n\nFacebook has also struggled. Its Aquila drone crashed during a test flight in June, sparking an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. That was the latest hiccup in Facebook’s plans to wirelessly connect the world, following an explosion earlier in 2016 that destroyed one of its satellites and political resistance to its free services in India.\n\nAlphabet canceled Titan because of economic and technical challenges. Project Loon, another X project to beam internet from high-altitude balloons, is still going. So is Project Wing, an effort to use drones for deliveries, rather than internet service.\n\n""By comparison, at this stage the economics and technical feasibility of Project Loon present a much more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world,"" the X spokeswoman said on Wednesday. ""Many people from the Titan team are now using their expertise as part of other high flying projects at X, including Loon and Project Wing.""\n\nProject Wing is facing its own challenges. In the fall of 2016, several Wing employees were asked to find other projects at Alphabet after X pulled back on some of its drone delivery plans.', 'Alphabet Inc. said it shut an effort to beam internet service from highflying drones, part of a number of moves by the Google parent to rein in less-promising initiatives and focus on those more likely to produce profit.\n\nThe drone project, called Titan, was folded in early 2016, though Google confirmed the move only this week.\n\nA spokeswoman Thursday said X, Alphabet’s unit that pursues moonshot initiatives, is still working...', 'Shares of Alphabet Inc.

Iyer, IFC Published : December 8, 2016\n\nEnergy Independence for Google Stock?\n\nAs we inch closer to the end of 2016, companies are starting to release their big plans for next year. As always, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) had something memorable to add: namely that it will meet 100% of its green energy requirements in 2017.\n\nThis should add an interesting new dimension to Google stock (GOOG), at least for those who are worried about climate change. Having a corporate entity—one of the biggest in the world—behave with social awareness is not something we see every day. (Source: “We’re set to reach 100% renewable energy — and it’s just the beginning,” Google Blog, December 6, 2016.)\n\n“[We are] the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable power,” wrote Google Senior Vice President Urs Hölzle in a blog post announcing the news. He added that Google now plans to “[directly buy] enough wind and solar electricity annually to account for every unit of electricity our operations consume, globally.”\n\nHowever, this doesn’t mean that solar panels are going to be plastered to Google’s rooftops. The company is too large an organisation to simply “move off the grid.” Instead, it chooses to buy all its green energy from renewable sources, even if that means going through a traditional utility.\n\nFor instance, if a green energy company decides to set up a big farm of solar panels, rather than sell to end consumers, it signs a contract with utility companies. The solar farms feed the green energy onto the grid, which can then be purchased by companies like Google.\n\nUtilizing these third-party sources is an important step for Google stock. Like its competitors at Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM), Google is building new data centers across the world. The existing data centers use three percent of the world’s electricity; a number that is expected to triple once these companies are done expanding.\n\nIn other words, tech companies will be consuming roughly 10% of the world’s energy supply just to power data centers. The energy demands will be extraordinary, but they have made public assurances that most of the energy will come from renewable sources.\n\n“The science tells us that tackling climate change is an urgent global priority,” Hölzle wrote. “We believe the private sector, in partnership with policy leaders, must take bold steps and that we can do so in a way that leads to growth and opportunity. And we have a responsibility to do so — to our users and the environment.”\n\nGoogle stock (GOOG) was up 1.35% at the time of writing, hovering at $769.22.', 'The world\'s leading internet services company is again expanding its climate and clean energy commitments, announcing yesterday that by 2017 it will meet 100 percent of its corporate energy demand with carbon-free energy.\n\nAlphabet Inc.\'s Google, whose physical headquarters is in Mountain View, Calif., but whose digital footprint extends across the globe, said it now has commitments to purchase 2.6 gigawatts of electricity under long-term contracts with renewable energy providers. That\'s up from 2 GW a year ago.\n\n""That\'s bigger than many large utilities and more than twice as much as the 1.21 gigawatts it took to send Marty McFly back in time,"" Google Senior Vice President of Technical Infrastructure Urs Hölzle said in a statement, referencing the 1985 blockbuster movie ""Back to the Future.""\n\nBut where the film\'s DeLorean time machine was powered by a lightning strike to its flux capacitor, Google says it will harness most of its power from wind turbines and solar panels. Such resources have become cost-competitive with fossil fuels in many regions, including states like Iowa, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Oregon, where Google is building the backbone of its U.S. data network.\n\n""Our engineers have spent years perfecting Google\'s data centers, making them 50 percent more energy efficient than the industry average,"" Hölzle said. ""But we still need a lot of energy to process trillions of Google searches every year, play more than 400 hours of YouTube videos uploaded every minute, and power the products and services that our users depend on.\n\n""That\'s why we began purchasing renewable energy — to reduce our carbon footprint and address climate change. But it also makes business sense,"" he added. ""Electricity costs are one of the largest components of our operating expenses at our data centers, and having a long-term stable cost of renewable power provides protection against price swings in energy.""\n\nIt also places Google ahead of its IT rivals — Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft — in terms of total megawatts of renewable energy procured, according to data compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.\n\nGoogle\'s renewable energy announcement was made alongside the release of a larger environmental report, which for the first time distills the firm\'s sustainability goals and achievements — from energy efficiency and solid waste reduction to water conservation and the benefits of cloud computing — into one document.\n\nKate Brandt, Google\'s lead for sustainability, described the report as detailing ""the major pillars of our work ... so that other people can learn from what we\'ve done.""\n\nRenewables \'readily available\'\n\nIn addition to its renewable energy procurement program, Google has deployed a variety of technologies to help its consumers bring clean energy benefits closer to home, Brandt said. For example, the company\'s Project Sunroof program used Google Earth 3-D imagery to help individual homeowners and even communities determine the potential for deploying rooftop solar panels.\n\nThe company has also invested heavily in what is known as ""machine learning"" to help boost the computing power of its data centers while using significantly less energy. According to Brandt, a Google data center today can extract 3.5 times more computing power from a single unit of energy compared with five years ago. That converts to millions of additional Google searches, Gmail deliveries and YouTube streamings with no additional environmental impact, officials said.\n\nReaction to Google\'s report, and especially to its pending clean energy milestone, was largely positive.\n\nGregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy, said in a statement that Google\'s more than six-year commitment to renewable energy is ""paying off."" He added that the 100 percent renewables achievement ""is a definitive demonstration that renewable energy is cost-effective and readily available at scale today.""\n\nGreenpeace, which has closely tracked IT companies for the environmental impacts of their operations, including through the use of its annual ""Click Green Scorecard,"" described Google as ""a catalyst in the dramatic growth in renewable energy procurement among corporations.""\n\nAmong other things, Greenpeace noted that Google was ""redefining the art of the possible by bringing significant renewable energy projects onto the same grid its data centers are powered from."" That stands in contrast to some other IT firms that purchase renewable energy credits to meet clean energy goals but continue to power their data centers and offices with grid-delivered fossil energy.\n\nGary Cook, senior IT analyst for Greenpeace, said the timing of Google\'s announcement is also significant. Corporate action on renewables has been an important driver for the clean energy sector over the past five years, and Google is among the firms that got the ball rolling.\n\n""Many companies have stood with the Obama administration\'s efforts to push for more renewable energy and action on climate change, and Google in particular has been putting their money where their mouth is,"" Cook said. ""Such continued leadership is likely to play an even more important role in the months to come, and companies who care about climate change and access to renewable energy need to stand up and be counted to accelerate the transition to a renewably powered economy.""\n\nReporter Christa Marshall contributed.\n\nReprinted from ClimateWire with permission from E&E News.

Facebook can\'t show more ads in the news feed without harming the user experience. To mitigate the headwinds from saturation in ad loads in the news feed, Facebook Inc is making a big push towards video content. CEO Mark Zuckerberg considers video as a ""megatrend on the same order as mobile"". The social networking giant has announced billions of dollars of investment in video content. However, the company is likely to face strong competition from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The battle between the search engine giant and the social network company for a bigger slice of the multibillion-dollar online advertising market is heating up.\n\nDigital video Ad spending to grow at a much faster clip.\n\nCurrently, TV ad spends dwarfs other forms of advertising in the United States. In 2016, total ad spending on television was $76.06 billion, up from $68.88 billion in 2015. In contrast, digital video ad spends came in at $9.84 billion in 2016, up from $7.66 billion in 2015. While the television advertising spend will continue to dwarf digital video ad spend, digital video ad spend is playing the catching up game. The online advertising market is expected to grow at a much faster clip going into 2020. According to marketing research agency, eMarketer, digital video ad spending will grow at a double-digit rate till 2020, compared to lower single digit growth in TV ad spend.\n\nDigital video ad spend is expected to grow from $9.84 billion in 2016 to $16.99 in 2020. A portion of this strong growth will be driven by advertisers directing more dollars from TV ads to digital video ads. TV ad spend is expected to grow from $70.6 to $77.17 billion in 2020. The strong growth in the digital marketing spend is not only restricted to the US. According to Statista, digital video ad spending worldwide will grow from $17.68 billion in 2016 to $23.78 billion in 2017.\n\nFacebook Inc looking to replace YouTube as the hub of all videos.\n\nTo capture a greater share of this growing digital video ad spending, Facebook has taken several measures, including the launch of Facebook TV app on Samsung smart TV. App launches for Apple TV and Amazon TV are also scheduled for release later. Earlier, Facebook had launched a dedicated tab for videos in its mobile app for live videos. The good news for Facebook is that its videos, both live videos and the newsfeed videos enjoy good traction with users. According to a survey by UBS Evidence Lab, 17% of respondents said that they used Facebook for live streaming, against 16% for YouTube. During the Q4 earnings call Facebook CFO Dave Wehner had said that ""Video\'s one of the big drivers of engagement growth on Facebook. It\'s also helpful on Instagram,"".\n\nIn line with Facebook\'s announcement during the earnings call, the company is making a strong push for original content programming. Facebook is reportedly seeking weekly shows with 30 minute episodes to make its video content stickier. The company is seeking original programming content genres from science to sports. However, the company is likely to avoid the hard news for now, as it may anger the news channels which publish videos on the social network. According to Facebook\'s head of global creative strategy Ricky Van Veen, the main aim in seeking original content is to jumpstart an ecosystem of partner content. To quote him:\n\n""Our goal is to kickstart an ecosystem of partner content for the tab, so we\'re exploring funding some seed video content, including original and licensed scripted, unscripted, and sports content, that takes advantage of mobile and the social interaction unique to Facebook. Our goal is to show people what is possible on the platform and learn as we continue to work with video partners around the world.""\n\nAdditionally, the company has also approached MLB to telecast one game a week on Facebook. Facebook is aiming to replace YouTube as the hub of all kinds of videos.\n\nGoogle launches paid channels on YouTube.\n\nTaking on YouTube may not be an easy thing, though. For starters, YouTube has a much larger collection of content and is able to target customized videos for its users. According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, YouTube crossed the 1 billion mark in total hours of video watched in a day. This a ten-fold increase from 2012 when YouTube launched the customized video suggestions using its algorithm based on the user\'s search history and interests. In comparison, users watched around 100 million hours of content on Facebook daily. That\'s a huge gap.\n\nGoogle also announced the launch of a subscription service on YouTube. For $35 a month you will get access to 40 channels including the four broadcast networks CBS, Fox, ABC and NBC, regional sports networks and cable channels like ESPN and Fox News. The YouTube TV service will also offer unlimited cloud DVR, an AI-powered search and recommendation system as well as access to YouTube Red programming. With the launch of the YouTube TV service, Google is looking to divert TV ad dollars to YouTube. Google has a strong competitive advantage when it comes to digital video content. With is algorithmic targeted content, it is able to retain users for a longer period and serve target ads. It is because of this that 72% of the advertisers are likely to advertise on YouTube compared to 46% on Facebook.\n\nFacebook Inc is likely to gain but YouTube will still remain dominant.\n\n2017 is a ""heavy investment"" year for Facebook. The company is planning to increase its investment from $4.5 billion in 2016, to $7-$7.5 billion in 2017, a large chunk of which will be invested in video content. While the higher expenditure will be a drag on profitability in the short term, if executed right, videos could become an important growth driver. While the company is likely to face strong competition from Google, which will remain the dominant player in the digital video ad space, Facebook is still likely to gain from the strong growth in digital video ad spending. After all, a rising tide lifts all. FB stock remains a good long term buy. Facebook stock is part of our Top Stock Picks from technology sector which have returned more than 120% over the years.', 'New Phone on the Block\n\nThere was much debate on the success of Google Pixel upon the phone\'s launch this past holiday season. Bears argued that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has consistently underperformed in non-advertising segments. Projects such as Google Fiber and prior smartphone Google Nexus were scrapped or paused before seeing a shed of profitability. Google Pixel is the tech giant\'s latest attempt to enter the high-end smartphone market. The Pixel boasted an industry-leading camera, powerful processor, smooth voice assistant as well as other quality features that warranted the phone\'s fantastic reviews.\n\nPixel, running on Android OS, launched at a truly opportune time considering Samsung Galaxy (OTC:SSNLF), the other high-end Android smartphone, was literally blowing up and had a product recall. Bulls argued that the Pixel will penetrate a market in which Google has absolutely no presence. Consumers in the high-end Android phone market will now have an alternative to Samsung Galaxy S7. Nearly 4 months have passed since the initial launch, and we believe it is the time to inquire whether the Pixel phone has been a success or failure thus far.\n\n(Source: Finder.com.au)\n\nIs the Pixel selling well?\n\nThe Pixel was estimated by Morgan Stanley analysts to sell between 3 million and 5 million units for its launch quarter. Counterpoint Research estimates that the Google Pixel has sold around 2.5 million units globally since October 2016. During the same period, Samsung and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sold around 80 million and 78 million devices respectively. Pixel sales number may seem incredibly low compare to those of its competitor, but this appears to be an issue of limited production rather than low demand. In fact, Google announced that Pixel saw high demand and sold out a majority of its variants. This leads us to believe the phone sales have been inhibited by poor inventory management. According to NowInStock.com, the only Pixel variant in stock as of February 15th is the 32GB Black, from Best Buy. Every other variant is either out of stock or available for pre-order.\n\n(Source: NowInStock.com)\n\nFaulty Partnership With Verizon\n\nGoogle signed a deal to make Verizon (NYSE:VZ) the sole carrier dealer of the Pixel, and Verizon has committed $25 million to advertise the phone in return. Subscribers of T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), AT&T (NYSE:T) and other carriers must buy the device from a retailer at full price and then activate the device on their carrier network. This partnership seems to be paying off to some degree, as demand is currently ahead of supply. According to a study conducted by Wave7 Research from surveying 50 Verizon carrier stores, Pixel accounted for around 9.5% of all Verizon smartphone sales in December.\n\nDespite the moderate success, we see the Pixel\'s exclusive contract with Verizon as an obstacle to sales growth in the long term. Even though consumers have the option of buying the phone on a monthly plan from the Google Store and activate it with their non-Verizon carrier, the convenience and volume of shopping in the physical stores of their carrier should not be underestimated. Last November, I went into the local T-Mobile store looking to replace my Samsung Galaxy S5 with a Pixel, after reading some favorable reviews. I found out that T-Mobile doesn\'t carry the phone, so I decided to go with the iPhone 7. My story is no more than an anecdote, but it certainly isn\'t rare for subscribers to buy whatever phones their carriers are offering.\n\nAdditionally, Verizon\'s involvement with a Google phone did not work out positively in the past. According to USA Today, Verizon previously had a partnership with Google and Samsung to sell the Galaxy Nexus phone back in 2011. The Galaxy Nexus phones sold by Verizon were pre-loaded with Verizon apps, had a non-functional Google Wallet app, and had delayed phone updates.\n\nAccording to FierceWireless, Verizon is the largest carrier in the US with more than 143 million subscribers. However, the next 3 largest carriers (AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint) combined had nearly 260 million subscribers. We believe it would be unwise for Google to keep Verizon as the Pixel\'s sole carrier distributor and neglect the massive number of AT&T/T-Mobile/Sprint subscribers who shop at their respective carriers\' physical stores.\n\n(Source: FierceWireless)\n\nVerdict\n\nJudging from the limited production of the phone, we assume the company\'s mission with the first Pixel model is to gauge the interest level of a Google phone in the high-end market. Under that assumption, we believe the Pixel\'s launch has ultimately been a success. Even though it was only available on Google Store, Best Buy, and Verizon, the Pixel phone managed to nearly sell out and is currently facing a supply shortage for many of its variants. According to Bloomberg, Google spokeswoman Iska Saric remarked that ""The demand for the Pixel phones has exceeded our expectations, which is exciting to see"". Morgan Stanley analysts project the Pixel to sell another 5-6 million units in 2017. Moving forward, we believe Google must take advantage of Samsung\'s misstep and emerge as the best high-end Android phone in the market (it\'s hard to look past exploding phones, even if the new products are said to be 100% fine). If Google can increase production, expand carrier distribution, and make meaningful improvements (water-resistance, anyone?) for Pixel 2, it may find grand success in smartphone market.', ""Will Alphabet Inc dethrone Apple Inc. ?\n\nApple may lose the 'most valuable company' tag to Alphabet .\n\n. What are the next steps for Apple to reclaim the throne?\n\nWhat is the viability factor for future iPhones?\n\nThere is plenty of reason to believe that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might lose its No. 1 market cap status to second-placed Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Apple’s market cap at the time of writing the article is $614.01 billion, while Alphabet is at $559.77 billion.\n\nIn the last twelve months, AAPL stock is only marginally up by 0.11% whereas GOOGL stock is up by 7.66%. The problem is that Apple’s revenue in 2016 declined by 8%, while Alphabet’s revenue in the first three-quarters of the year increased by 19.65%.There’s a valid reason why the positional switchover might happen. Let's take a closer look.\n\nMarket Segments and Valuations\n\nThe problem for Apple was that the bulk of their revenue, 63.4%, came from iPhone sales. With smartphone sales growth showing signs of plateauing around the world, the odds of iPhone sales picking up pace over the next few years is quite slim. Compare that to Alphabet’s continued double-digit growth and the fact that online advertising has plenty of room to grow in the future, the difference in the fortunes of both the companies is quite stark.\n\nAt this point, one might argue that the valuations of both these companies have already priced in these growth factors, as Alphabet is trading at 29 times its earnings, while Apple is trading less than half of that valuation, at 13.69 times. Clearly, Apple’s valuation looks extremely depressed compared to Alphabet’s, but so do the fortunes of the respective segments they compete in. The market can remain irrational much longer than we can remain solvent, and there is no guarantee that the situation will reverse soon.\n\nApple’s depressed valuation makes it a great buy at this price point, and the biggest factor that an investor needs to consider is the slowdown in smartphone sales. Though it might sound preposterous, the lack of growth opportunity in smartphone sales around the world is possibly the best thing that happened to Apple and its investors. This has already pushed Apple into a corner, and with smartphone penetration in developed markets at record levels, there are very few new hands left for the company to push their iPhone into. (See Also: AAPL Stock: Apple Inc. Hints At Its Next Disruptive Product )\n\nWhat Next for Apple?\n\nAs a result, Apple has certain options in front of it. The company can now shift its focus to emerging markets, where smartphone penetration is still low. Though the return might be a lot lower than what you normally see in developed markets, this will at least provide some room for growth, albeit at a lower margin level. Apple has already started pushing its low cost model iPhone SE to address this market segment, and it will continue its push in that direction.\n\nThough analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has indicated that there’s no iPhone SE refresh coming in March 2017, there’s no reason for Apple to discontinue the model. His argument is that Apple wants to maximise margins and prevent the SE from cannibalising potential iPhone 7 sales, but markets like China and India will still have room for SE sales through next year, which Apple can’t afford to let go of.\n\nNow that it is acutely aware of the state of the market in developed countries, the company has no choice but to accelerate its innovation process to make its newer models irresistible to buyers in the United States and other developed markets.\n\nIn addition, the company may want to make refresh cycles as short as possible, with the possible exception of iPhone SE for early next year. And the only way to do that is by producing better phones than ever before, which will push the company to its limits when it comes to innovation. No more incremental innovations like iPhone 7 vs iPhone 6S, because it is just not going to cut it any more. And we’re not just talking about next year’s iPhone, dubbed iPhone 8. The company must think beyond its 10th anniversary edition of the iconic smartphone.\n\nAlso Read: Apple Stock: Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Set For A Big Holiday Quarter Rally?\n\nBeyond iPhone\n\nFurthermore, as the company fights for its smartphone sales numbers, it also will scramble to build its alternate revenue streams that run through its services portfolio.\n\nCase in point is the way Apple started focusing on Apple Pay’s rollout. After the launch in October 2014, Apple Pay was available in United States and United Kingdom by the end of 2014, and then added Canada and Australia in 2015.\n\nBut in 2016 when the smartphone sales slowdown shocked the company, Apple Pay was rolled out in China, Singapore, Switzerland, France, Hong Kong, Russia, New Zealand, Japan and Spain. That’s nearly nine countries in twelve months, and it's clear that a lot more will be added in the next twelve months.\n\nApple’s services revenue was the only bright spot in the company’s financial reports last fiscal, growing by 22% from $19.909 billion last year to $24.348 billion. It still accounts for little more than ten percent of their overall revenues, but a proper ecosystem that can add value to its loyal customers will go a long way in keeping those customers inside Apple’s world, eventually making sure that the company’s moat is as good as it can be.\n\nThe Edge Remains\n\nNow throw in the fact that Apple captured nearly 91% of the smartphone industry’s profits in 2015, it’s amply clear that a lot of companies that are selling smartphones today won't be around five years from now.\n\nApple has a cash generating machine in the iPhone, and the innovation and applications that it brings to the table will be unbeatable in the market, creating a huge lead for the company over time. If such a company is selling at 13 times earnings, the best play would be to add them to your portfolio because the market hasn’t valued these strengths into its current pricing, which seems to reflect the current revenue growth rate and not the inherent strength of the company that will serve them well over the years.\n\nLooking to invest in technology companies? Here are our latest Tech Stock Picks which have outperformed the NASDAQ by over 109%."", 'Speculation is rife that the iPhone could be red in color. This is according to a Japanese blog which has a decent record in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) scoops. The iPhone 8 is expected to be launched next year around September when Apple traditionally launches new products. The new iPhone color would be an addition to the ones that already exist including silver, black, gold, jet black and rose gold. Besides the new bold color, the Japanese blog also added that the new iPhone would sport a new processor, the A11 chip.\n\nInformation That the IPhone 8 Could Be Red Leaked by Supplier\n\nThe Japanese blog indicated that its source of information was a supplier based in Taiwan. The blog went on to say that the next iPhone was not the iPhone 8 but iterations of iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7. Rival Apple news sites added to the confusion by saying there would be three iPhones released in the coming year. This would be the iPhone 7, the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 8.\n\nRumors on how the next iPhone will look like have been increasing by the day as the iconic smartphone nears its tenth year of existence. Among the unconfirmed rumors, besides that the iPhone 8 could be red in color, is the fact that the iPhone 8 would no longer be having the Home button but the functionality would instead be placed at the rear of the phone or under the screen. Equally, it has also been rumored that the display area in the new iPhone would cover the entire front of the phone.\n\nCurved Display\n\nThere have also been other rumors suggesting that the next iPhone, or at least one of the versions, would have an OLED display. Other features that have been speculated about include capabilities for wireless charging.\n\nAdding strength to the rumors is the fact that for a long time now, Apple has been relying on incremental changes to the iPhone and it now needs to do something revolutionary in order to enjoy sales figures that would rival those of the first few generations of the iPhone. this will require doing more than offering more colors, like the rumors that the iPhone 8 could be red suggest.\n\nApple Inc fell 0.57% in Monday’s trading to close at $113.30 a share.', 'It has only been a few months since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) rolled out its latest iPhone models and the smartphone world is already looking forward to what the Cupertino-based tech giant has to offer in its next-gen smartphone. Here is a quick review of the latest rumors surrounding the highly-anticipated iPhone 8.\n\nAccording to a new report from CNET, the next iPhone model, dubbed the iPhone 8, will support wireless charging. For those who don’t know, wireless charging is a feature which has already been introduced by the Cupertino company’s smartphone rivals. Hence, it is about time that such a feature was added to an iPhone model as well. Also, CNET was one of the first publications to correctly predict the replacement of the 3.5mm headphone jack with lightening connectors which indicates that this is a very reliable source of speculation regarding the next-generation iPhone model.\n\nInterestingly, KGI Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also backed Apple to incorporate wireless charging capability in its next iPhone model. Mr. Ming is rightly regarded as one of the most credible sources of information regarding Apple’s projects. Hence, it has virtually been confirmed that the next iPhone model will offer wireless charging to users, allowing Apple to compete better with its smartphone rivals.\n\nRecent speculation has strongly hinted that wireless charging will not be the only new feature introduced on the upcoming iPhone 8. Apple has recently patented a new technology which will allow the tech giant to incorporate touch sensors in place of the physical buttons included on the sides of the current iPhone models. Forbes contributor Ewan Spence has strongly suggested that Apple could introduce such touch sensors in its upcoming iPhone 8.\n\nFurthermore, Business Insider believes that Apple will stick with its decision to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack when it launches its next-gen smartphone. Despite the criticism faced by the tech giant for the removal of such a traditional feature, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have experienced strong sales which indicates that majority of users have not been put off by the removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack on the current iPhone models. This is why the next iPhone model will continue to incorporate lightening connectors instead of a traditional 3.5mm headphone jack.\n\nDespite the increase in speculation surrounding the upcoming iPhone 8, Apple has continued to remain tight-lipped regarding its future projects. This has made it significantly difficult to predict what the new smartphone will be all about. Hopefully, the next-gen iPhone will live up to its billing as the most drastically changed iPhone model, ever. Stay tuned for more news and updates regarding the highly-anticipated smartphone device.', ""Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reports on 1/26. Sentiment has been mixed given the decline in core margins in 3Q16, followed by President Trump’s election and the ensuing shift to cyclicals, offset by positive ad checks in January. For 4Q, Bank of America Merrill Lynch is constructive on positive ad trends, with decoupling of desktop and tablet ad bidding potentially driving upside in desktop (also a TAC benefit), and thinks the street will learn to live with y/y core margin declines. Bank of America Merrill Lynch thinks 4Q street expectations for 22% y/y net rev growth are reasonable (Google Website growth to decelerate q/q, Hardware will help offset), and Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects a modest EPS beat.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch models a 190 bps y/y contraction in 4Q core Google margins (vs 100 bps in 3Q), driven by the mobile transition, hardware ramp, and YouTube. For 2017, potential margin headwinds include: 1) additional hardware growth; 2) elevated marketing; 3) outsized YouTube growth; 4) video content investments; and 5) Cloud build-out. At this point, Bank of America Merrill Lynch believes the Street is somewhat expecting y/y core margin pressure, which could be offset by lower Other Bets losses.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch's 4Q net revenue est. at $20.75bn is below a recently rising Street est. at $21.05bn, while its EPS at $9.77 is above the Street at $9.63.Bank of America Merrill Lynch's 2017 revenue is also below and EPS slightly above at $41.22. While 2H ad product improvements are still to come, Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects street optimism on 2H when comps ease and economic acceleration picks up. Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects y/y core margins to stabilize in 2H, though incremental Cloud investments and/or growth in hardware could drive ongoing core margin contraction into 2018.\n\nSentiment has improved in recent weeks, but Bank of America Merrill Lynch thinks overall sentiment is still mixed due to core margin, regulatory and net neutrality concerns. Bank of America Merrill Lynch thinks an EPS meet/beat should be enough to support current non-GAAP P/E at 17x 2018E (14x ex-cash, Other Bets losses), and Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects positive sentiment on 2H’17 as investors look to economic improvement and easing comps, as well as potential new ad products, new YouTube feature ramps, and Cloud gains.

Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost -5.13% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -8.09% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -13.32% from $53.17 , the 52-week high touched on Dec. 13, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 15.74% for the past 12 months.\n\nBrokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to buy ConocoPhillips (COP)’s shares projecting a $57.9 target price. What do this target means? Price targets reflect what the analyst believes a stock will be worth four quarters into the future. Are investors supposed to sell when the stock hits the target? Price targets frequently change, depending on the outlook for a company’s earnings. Sometimes it may seem like it, but analysts don’t just pull their price targets out of thin air. Typically, they estimate what the company’s earnings and cash flow will be for the next couple of years, and then apply a ratio – such as a price-to-earnings ratio – to those estimates to determine what the future stock price should theoretically be.\n\nCOP’s revenue has declined at an average annualized rate of about -17.9% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 12% looks attractive.\n\nWhile there are a number of profitability ratios that measure a company’s ability to generate profit from the sales or services it provides, one of the most important is the net profit margin. It tells us what percentage of revenue a company keeps after all its bills are paid. While the higher this number is, the better, there is no gold standard. That’s why this number shouldn’t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company’s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, ConocoPhillips net profit margin for the 12 months is at -14.74%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin -13.84%, and the sector’s average is -405.81%. In that light, it seems in good position compared to its peers but weakness can be witnessed when compared with the sector.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -0.28% since hitting a peak level of $867.13 on Mar. 13, 2017. Thanks to an increase of almost 4.16% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 9.1% so far on the year — still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 28.53% higher from $672.66, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Jun. 27, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 9.65% for the past six months.\n\nThe good news is there’s still room for the share price to grow. At recent closing price of $864.58, GOOGL has a chance to add $124.1 or 14.35% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($988.68) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 1.8 looks like a buy. It has a 36-month beta of 0.97 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride.\n\nFor the past 5 years, Alphabet Inc.’s EPS growth has been nearly 14.8%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 19.28%, annually.\n\nTwo other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company’s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company’s ability to turn an investor’s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders’ behalf. Alphabet Inc.’s ROE is 15.02%, while industry’s is 17.5%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 10.31%.\n\nReturn on assets, on the other hand, measures a company’s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year. These returns cover a period from 1988-2015 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, an independent accounting firm. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zack Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.\n\nVisit performance for information about the performance numbers displayed above.\n\nVisit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.\n\nReal time prices by BATS.

The case has been filed with the California Superior Court in San Francisco.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Google has a spying program in place which instructs employees to keep and eye out for employees who seem like they\'d be leaking information out of the company. It gets even more interesting. Google also has a policy in place which disallows employees from reporting any illegal activities happening within the company, even to Google\'s attorneys. Moreover, Google employees also cannot write about working in the Silicon Valley company without getting permission from the enterprise.\n\nThe scope of the policies is also very all-encompassing which makes it all the more riskier for employees. The suit details that ""everything at Google"" is classified as confidential by the policies and violating them leads directly to termination. Due to this, employees are unable to reveal anything about their workplace to anyone outside of the company, be it their partner or family.\n\nThe suit noted Google being guilty of 12 violations of the laws, and if the company is found guilty on all counts, then the payout could reach up to $3.8 billion. Out of this figure, 75% would directly go to the state for the penalty and the rest would be shared between Google\'s 65,00 employees. This would come out to a hefty sum of $14,500 per employee.

The agreements define confidential information as ""without limitation, any information in any form that relates to Google or Google\'s business that is not generally known,"" according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit says the agreements violate state laws that provide that employers cannot bar workers from discussing their wages or disclosing information to government agencies.\n\nA spokesperson for Mountain View, California-based Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, said in a statement that the claims were ""baseless,"" and said the agreements were designed to protect sensitive business information and not to bar employees from discussing working conditions.\n\n""We\'re very committed to an open internal culture, which means we frequently share with employees details of product launches and confidential business information,"" the spokesperson said.\n\nGoogle is facing similar claims from an unidentified employee in proceedings before the U.S. National Labor Relations Board, which recently struck down confidentiality agreements and other employment contracts that could discourage workers from discussing concerns at T-Mobile USA Inc, DirectTV and a number of other companies.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the plaintiff says that to enforce its policies, Google forces workers to spy on each other through a program called ""Stopleaks"" that requires them to report the disclosure of confidential information. Employees can be fired or sued for violating employment agreements or failing to report leaks, according to the lawsuit.\n\n""Google continues to insist that Googlers refrain from plainly communicating with others that Google is violating the law or endangering consumers,"" the complaint says.\n\nPlaintiffs in court cases are rarely allowed to proceed anonymously absent extraordinary circumstances. The Google worker says that being identified could harm his reputation at the company and his future job prospects.\n\nThe plaintiff is seeking to represent all current and former Google employees who signed the agreements.

The company missed estimates just once in the last four quarters, that too by a small margin.\n\nComing to the price performance, over the past one year, shares of Alphabet have been steadily treading higher. The stock has returned 12.89% compared with the Zacks categorized Internet Services industry’s gain of 12.78%.\n\nView photos\n\nWhat Happened in the Last Reported Quarter?\n\nAlphabet’s third-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues which also grew year over year. The increase was primarily driven by the boom in Mobile Search, with the ongoing strength in YouTube. Also, strength in programmatic advertising and Play aided revenue growth. Other Bets revenues remained lumpy.\n\nFactors at Play in Q4\n\nThe main drivers of the Google business haven’t changed. Pricing remains under pressure, both on account of the ongoing FX concerns as well as continued strength in mobile and TrueView. Volumes are however encouraging as total paid click growth was a reassuring 33% last quarter.\n\nGoogle has gained strength in the mobile platform. Management is focused on driving mobile experiences and the company is well positioned to pick up strong intent-to-buy signals as a result of studying mobile searches from its huge database. As a result, revenue from mobile platform is expected to increase in the upcoming results.\n\nYouTube remains a strong contributor benefiting from the increase in online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged with the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers every day.\n\nAlso, Google has turned more aggressive toward the commercialization of its self-driving cars. It aims to expand its revenues from this segment in the upcoming release. However, the current regulatory environment doesn’t support fully automated cars, so there could be some problems on their part.\n\nGoogle’s cloud business trails Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure and IBM. The company’s cloud business is expected to well in the to-be reported quarter. And finally, Google platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream continue to help it draw more users and sell more ads.\n\nOn a cautionary note, Google’s troubles in the EU are mounting and despite its attempts to appease authorities by investing in the region, the region may prove much more expensive for it. Google is not providing for this outflow, which could mean that it still has a reasonable chance to come out victorious. But the developments are worth keeping an eye on as these are the main reasons for the overhang on the company’s shares.\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not show that Alphabet will beat on earnings this third quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.\n\nThe company’s Zacks Rank #2 and Earnings ESP of -0.26% make surprise prediction difficult.

The result is that a large number of the traditional technology leaders are under pressure from their charts.\n\nFacebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are all in the position of lagging broader indices. It has become time for a make-or-break situation as each are currently facing short-term chart resistance.\n\nFacebook Inc (FB)\n\nShares of Facebook had struggled since the election for a few reasons. The drop in price transitioned the 50-day moving average for FB stock into a bearish trend, indicating a higher probability of lower prices over the next 4 to 6 weeks if the trend remains in place.\n\nThe fact that the stock recently moved below its heavily monitored 200-day trendline and is now finding resistance at the $120-price where it resides has put Facebook shares into this must-win situation. This is FB’s current “must-win” price as a break above will open some room overhead for the stock to move higher.\n\nFacebook shares recently benefited from an oversold technical bounce, but volume has dried after that rally, indicating that the bounce may be more of the “dead cat” variety.\n\nFor now, traders should steer clear of FB as a rejection at $120 is likely to target another wave of selling and the potential for Facebook to test its June lows of $108.\n\nTesla Motors Inc (TSLA)\n\nAnother technology company struggling in a downward trend is Tesla Motors. Since peaking in April, TSLA shares have shed over 25% as the stock charts a pattern of lower highs and lower lows. The pattern suggests that Tesla stock is suffering as traders and investors are taking any rally as an opportunity to reduce holdings.\n\nFrom a long-term perspective, TSLA is trading in a bear market as the stock is well below its 20-month moving average, which is also trending lower. Some traders may see Tesla stock as a “value”, but the technical trend suggests otherwise.\n\nLooking at the chart, TSLA’s “must win” price is at $195; the spot where its 50-day moving average currently sits. This trendline has been staunch resistance for Tesla stock since it rolled over in August and began to trend lower.\n\nFrom there, TSLA stock gets into a technical pinch as support is immediately below at $180. This means that we’re likely to see an increase in volatility in Tesla shares as one of these key levels is going to give way for the next big move in the stock.\n\nNext Page', 'The stock markets snapped five-days of losing streak on Friday. The markets will look to consolidate the gains recorded on Friday. The upcoming earnings and economic data could be a pointer to the sentiments.\n\nThe following are some of the key companies that will report their results this week:', 'After loading up on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares, could Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) buy Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares next? Alphabet has been bought aggressively by multiple famous gurus. Buffett and Munger have commented favorably on the company\'s competitive position several times. The latest Berkshire shareholder letter indicates Buffett is very knowledgeable about the technology space.\n\nThe fact that so many value investors are buying Alphabet at current multiples indicate it is a great business at a fair price. It is not immediately obvious how popular the stock is because Alphabet trades an A and a C share class, which are treated as seperate companies by lists put together through automation. They are economically equivalent, however, and if you add them up, Alphabet is one of the highest-owned stocks among the great investors tracked by GuruFocus.\n\nBack in 2009, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) talked about IBM (NYSE:IBM), Apple and Google:\n\n""The chances of being way wrong in IBM are probably less, at least for us, than the chances of being way wrong in Google or Apple. I just don’t know how to value them. I would not be at all surprised to see them be worth a lot more money 10 years from now but I would not buy either one of them. I sure as hell wouldn’t short them either.""\n\nIn addition, Charlie Munger (Trades, Portfolio) said:\n\n""Google has a huge new moat. In fact, I\'ve probably never seen such a wide moat.""\n\nMunger added it was also filled with sharks. It is impossible to assess a moat without understanding competitors and their chances to successfully assault a company’s market share. In this case, Munger might have seen the potential early while Buffett remained unconvinced. Buffett has alluded to his biggest mistakes as acts of omission.\n\nBill Gates, former Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) chairman and a good friend of Buffett, stepped down in 2014. Microsoft runs the only real competition to Google search. Gates stepping down may have freed Buffett to learn about that competitive landscape from him.\n\nIn additon, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Chairman Eric Schmidt traveled to Omaha to talk to Buffett when setting up the new Alphabet structure, which is molded after Berkshire.\n\nShortly before the trip, they brought in CFO Ruth Porat, who understands the tech founders\' goals for the company.\n\nBuffett included the following paragraphs in the 2017 shareholder letter, putting my spider senses on red alert:\n\n""In 2002, entrepreneur Mitch Kapor asserted that \'By 2029 no computer – or ‘machine intelligence’ – will have passed the Turing Test,\' which deals with whether a computer can successfully impersonate a human being. Inventor Ray Kurzweil took the opposing view. Each backed up his opinion with $10,000. I don’t know who will win this bet, but I will confidently wager that no computer will ever replicate Charlie. That same year, Craig Mundie of Microsoft asserted that pilotless planes would routinely fly passengers by 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Google argued otherwise. The stakes were $1,000 each. To ease any heartburn Eric might be experiencing from his outsized exposure, I recently offered to take a piece of his action. He promptly laid off $500 with me. (I like his assumption that I’ll be around in 2030 to contribute my payment, should we lose.)""\n\nThis paragraph shows Buffett has been studying the tech world very hard and is open to the possibility the Turing test will be cracked by 2029. He also must have looked into the dynamics of driverless or pilotless technology, note the recent investment into airlines, to take on a $500 bet. I do not think betting against Buffett is generally a profitable endeavour. What jumped out at me is, apparently, Alphabet’s chairman and Buffett recently spoke again. They must have spoken for quite some time for the subject of this casual bet to come up.\n\nAll these factors have led me to speculate on the potential of an Alphabet investment.\n\nThe pieces are falling into place.\n\nBuffett has been studying tech intensely.\n\nBerkshire has made a 180 as far as tech investments go.\n\nBuffett and Munger view Alphabet as having an incredibly strong moat.\n\nAlphabet\'s valuation is at an attractive level given the interest from the value investing greats. Porat is a great addition to the executive suite ,covering up pre-existing weaknesses in the team.\n\nGoogle executives have met with Buffett on multiple occasions and Schmidt talked to him recently.\n\nThe one thing I could see keeping Buffett from making an investment is his distaste for stock-based compensation. Alphabet continues to dole it out like it is candy on Halloween.\n\nI would go as far as to say it would greatly surprise me if we do not see Berkshire buying a stake in Alphabet in the next five years.\n\nDisclosure: Author owns none of these stocks.\n\nStart a free 7-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.\n\nAbout the author:', 'M&T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB) gained 0.85% with the closing price of $168.22.

The company claims that without those stolen stuff, Otto’s technology, which forms an important part of Uber’s efforts to roll out autonomous vehicles for its ride sharing service, wouldn’t have evolved.\n\nStemmed from an Accidental CC-ing\n\nA supplier had mistakenly included a Waymo employee on an e-mail chain that was supposed to be delivered to the Uber team. The attached “OTTO FILES” comprised a drawing of a self-driving car Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) circuit board quite similar to the one Waymo has been developing secretly.\n\nWaymo’s lawsuit states that ”The sudden resignations from Waymo, Otto’s quick public launch with Mr. Lewandowski at the helm, and Uber’s near-immediate acquisition of Otto for more than half a billion dollars all caused Waymo grave concern regarding the possible misuse of its intellectual property.""\n\nReigniting the Conflict\n\nThe two camps once lived in harmony. Alphabet executive David Drummond joined Uber’s board in 2013 when Alphabet’s venture capital arm GV, then Google Ventures, invested $258 million in the company and planned to include Uber rides in the Google Maps app.\n\nHowever, things started to go wrong when Uber decided to develop its own mapping and driverless car technology. The company has opened a technology center in Pittsburgh and hired some robotics specialists from Carnegie Mellon University. It also collaborated with automakers such as Volvo and acquired Otto.\n\nGoogle on the other hand launched a pilot project that enables carpooling in San Francisco Bay Area. Available through Google-owned maps app, Waze, the service is presently under beta testing with a handful of Bay Area companies including Adobe and Google itself. Drummond stepped down from Uber’s board last year.\n\nThe lawsuit certainly complicates the ongoing clash between two of the early leaders in the autonomous vehicle space. Well established car companies like Ford (NYSE: F – Free Report ), Toyota (NYSE: TM – Free Report ) and General Motors (NYSE: GM – Free Report ) on the other hand have just started to make their way into this market.\n\nCurrently, Alphabet shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) clearly beats Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with its long term vision and product strategy.\n\nAmazon’s Pioneer Products in IoT\n\nAmazon launched its smart home assistant speaker, Amazon Echo back in 2014 when Google and Apple were just in the rudimentary stages of realizing the fact that smartphones and apps are approaching their saturation points and the future belongs to AI and Internet of Things. In 2016 holiday season, Amazon Echo and Echo Dot were the most popular devices bought by people. Echo Dot is the latest mode of Amazon Echo. It is powered by Alexa, the smart assistant which takes user voice commands and execute them. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is clearly a trend setter in IoT, a market where estimated annual revenues are excepted to surpass $470 billion by 2020. Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has recently launched Android Things, a special operating system for making IoT-based mobile apps and software. Google also launched Google Home, a smart home suite, in November 2016. Alphabet has another interesting product called “Nest” which acts as a smart device to control temperature, detect fire and control devices. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also has its own IoT platform, HomeKit. However, it didn’t get the expected popularity.\n\nAdvanced Real-Time Chart: If not automatically loaded with the correct symbol related to this article, you can manually enter it (ex. AAPL) to update the chart.\n\nAmazon’s Powerful Footprint in eBooks Industry\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) receives a huge chunk of its revenue from its Kindle product line. The company started selling Kindle reading devices based on the popularity of eBooks. Today, Amazon has over 70% of eBook market share. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) do not have a footprint in this area.\n\nAmazon Dwarfing Google, Apple in Cloud\n\nAmazon remains the leader in Cloud services, thanks to its sterling Cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon’s AWS revenue in 2016 is expected to come in at $12 billion, compared to $7.9 billion last year. Over the past four quarters, AWS accounted for two-thirds of Amazon’s operating profits. Amazon.com’s, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) only competitors in this area are Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft. Apple has no Cloud platform for advanced Enterprise. Its iCloud service is only for iOS and Mac users. Apple’s adherence to its ecosystem-centric approach may cost the company dearly in the future.\n\nAmazon’s Revolutionary Technology in Retail\n\nAmazon recently revealed Amazon Go, a disruptive new way to do shopping in stores. Amazon Go promises to change the way we shop forever. Amazon Go promises no checkout lines and quick shopping in an unprecedented way. Check out this video to see what Amazon Go is all about and how it works.\n\nProblem with Apple and Google\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is focusing entirely on trying to reinvigorate growth in its iPhone product line, which has clearly lost steam, and future is not looking very promising, as well. Apple slashed its iPhone 7 production orders by 10% for the first quarter of 2017, a clear sign that the company will have to tap into other areas like IoT, robots, content and AI. Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google deserves appreciation on its ambitious “moonshot” projects. From robots to energy and self-driving cars, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has invested in to multiple product lines. But the company seems to have an execution problem. It has invested millions in moonshot projects so far has faced problems after failing to properly use its robotics startups.\n\nAmazon’s Future is Bright\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also working on new product delivery methods, self-driving trucks, streaming content and drones. The company has a flexible working structure and no standardization, thanks to Jeff Bezos’ vision.', 'Three more languages can now be translated in a more natural manner by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Translate. These languages include Vietnamese, Russian and Hindi. Previously, a phrase-based translation approach was used but this has now been replaced by a neural machine-based system that yields higher-quality and more natural-sounding translations.\n\nInitially in September 2016, the neural machine-based system translated English to Chinese and vice versa. Two months later in November, predominantly European and Asian languages such as Korean, Japanese, Turkish, German, French, Portuguese, and Spanish were added. Besides making up over 35% of all queries on Google Translate, these languages are spoken by more than a third of the global population.\n\nWeb pages\n\nGoogle’s neural translation system for the three new languages that are now supported can be accessed through the web, iOS and Android. The service is also available on Google App and Google Search. Preparations for website page translations on the Chrome browser are underway.\n\nIn an online posting the head of product for Google Translate, Barak Turovsky, revealed that support for more languages will be made available in the near future. The online search giant hopes to have translations for all the 103 languages done using the neural system eventually.\n\nNeural networks\n\nThe use of neural machines for translation involves training neural networks using data or information that is already available before the networks can make inferences concerning incoming queries. This is the same approach that Google has employed in its artificial intelligence projects. Despite the adoption of the neural network to translate, contributions by real people to the translation service will not be discontinued.\n\nGoogle is, however, not the only firm utilizing artificial intelligence in its translation service as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is employing the same with its translation application. Naver, the largest online search company in South Korea, also recently unveiled a translation tool that also makes use of artificial intelligence. The tool is called Papago and it currently supports four languages namely English, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese.\n\nOn Monday shares of Alphabet Inc fell by 0.21% to close the day at $847.27.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.', 'The race to build the infrastructure necessary for high-speed internet in Charlotte has brought with it damage to existing utility infrastructure. It has also caused inconvenience as some roads have had to be closed, and utilities were temporarily unavailable due to the damages wrought on them.\n\nIn the last 24 months, contractors hired by firms such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) have been laying the networks in Charlotte’s right-of-way, which begins at the curb and stretches to between 8-10 feet into the yards of residents. Google announced its entry into the Charlotte market in early 2015 and the building of the network is in progress. AT&T had announced its entry a little earlier than Google but construction started in mid-2015.\n\nReimbursements for damages\n\nWhile the high-speed internet promises to faster connections to the internet and consequently faster downloads of big files such as movies, some residents have been unable to stomach it. Complaints to the city have been increasing by the day. And in the last one and half years, officials in Charlotte have demanded reimbursements of over $630,000 from contractors hired by companies such as AT&T and Google for the damages done to utility lines and property belonging to the city.\n\nHigh water bills\n\nSome of the most common complaints from residents of Charlotte include trampled yards, cut gas lines, truck-clogged streets, muddy roads, cut water lines, and damaged cable and phone lines. In some instances, residents have had to endure high water bills due to the spillage and wastage resulting from damaged water pipes.\n\nGoogle has already acknowledged the numerous problems and has promised to minimize the inconveniences as work progresses.\n\n“We want to be good neighbors, so we’re doing everything we can to prevent unnecessary disruptions and resolve issues quickly. Google Fiber and our contractors take all construction-related incidents very seriously,” read a statement from Google.\n\nIn the last trading session that took place on December 23, 2016, shares of Alphabet rose by 0.26% to close the day at $809.93. Meanwhile, shares of AT&T Inc declined by 0.19% to close the day at $42.65.', 'Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp., which all posted quarterly results Thursday, reinforced what’s become a truism in technology: the biggest growth is in businesses that deliver computing over the internet.\n\nMicrosoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-center servers -- the machines at the heart of cloud computing.\n\nWhile profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signaled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\n""Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,"" Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. ""I definitely think we’re going to have a great year.""\n\nWhat started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centers to support their own web services.\n\n‘Disruptive Forces’\n\nMore than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner estimated in July. ""This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age,"" the research firm said at the time.\n\nStock prices reflect this optimism. Microsoft and Alphabet shares hit a record this week. Microsoft gained 2.2 percent, Google was down about 1 percent and Intel rose 1.5 percent at 1:57 p.m. Friday in New York.\n\nMicrosoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 percent in the fiscal second quarter.\n\n""As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who rates Microsoft shares outperform. “If margins are growing, people are even happier.""\n\nMicrosoft’s Effort\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nRedmond, Washington-based Microsoft has been spending on data centers and adding products to win new cloud customers. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would ""materially improve"" in the current year. That’s because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centers support more customers.\n\nMicrosoft has pledged to reach annualized revenue of $20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than $14 billion at the end of the second quarter.\n\nIntel’s fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 percent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 percent less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said.\n\n“It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call.\n\nAmazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate $3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 percent from a year earlier.\n\n""Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud,"" Moerdler said. ""Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack.”', 'When Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) was left for dead five years ago, it was unimaginable that it could be ranked among America’s most successful companies as it had been for the two decades of Windows’ dominance. Now, with its success in cloud computing and the engines of several of its older businesses, Microsoft threatens to pass Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the owner of Google, in market cap, as the search company struggles to find new large and fast-growing businesses.\n\nMicrosoft has come close to doing what was once impossible: becoming the second most valuable public company in America, trailing only Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). After earnings, Alphabet’s stock sold down so that its market cap is about $565 billion. Microsoft’s rose to $515 billion.\n\nMicrosoft’s earnings, matched against Alphabet’s, show the extent to which CEO Satya Nadella has transformed the company. Microsoft’s Productivity and Businesses division had revenue of $7.3 billion. The division has both the consumer and business sides of the old Windows business. The Intelligent Cloud division is Microsoft’s huge cloud intuitive, which is large enough to threaten industry leader Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). Its revenue was $6.9 billion. More Personal Computing, the third division, had revenue of $11.8 billion. It has the legacy game segment, search and Microsoft OEM.\n\nGoogle, on the other hand, continues to rely almost completely on search, which makes it the one-legged stool that creates investor anxiety. Google ad revenue was $19.1 billion of the fourth quarter total of $21.2 billion. And the aggregate cost per click, one of Google’s most important metrics, fell 9% year over year. Its revenue from what it calls “other bets” was a mere $262 million.\n\nAs investors look for stability with large tech companies, which currently trade at historically high levels, they can only find it in public corporations that successfully operate multiple businesses. Microsoft’s shares have risen 23% in the past year, about the same as the Nasdaq, and Alphabet’s by 14%. This does not take into account stock movements after earnings announcements. At the rate of growth in stock prices, Microsoft will be the more valuable of the two companies by mid-year.', 'Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is up $0.21 to $64.48 in after-hours trading Thursday after the company reported its FY17 second-quarter earnings results.\n\nThe software giant posted non-GAAP earnings of $0.83 per share on revenues of $26.07 billion, up 1.5% from a year ago. Analysts were expecting EPS of $0.79 on revenues of $25.29 billion. Microsoft said revenue in Intelligent Cloud was $6.86 billion and increased 8% (up 10% in constant currency), ahead of the guidance the company had set of between $6.55 billion to $6.75 billion. Analysts expected the company’s cloud segment to bring in about $6.73 billion. Revenue from Azure, Microsoft’s major cloud offering, jumped 93 percent year over year with its commercial cloud annualized run rate passing $14 billion. In October, Azure saw revenue growth of 116 percent.\n\nMeanwhile “productivity and business processes” revenue was up 10% and $7.4 billion.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella highlighted out advances in artificial intelligence, stating: “Accelerating advancements in AI across our platforms and services will provide further opportunity to drive growth in the Microsoft Cloud.”\n\nThe company’s “More Personal Computing” division saw revenue decline 5% to $11.8 billion driven primarily by lower phone revenue.\n\nThis was the first quarter since Microsoft closed its $24 billion acquisition of LinkedIn which accounted for $228 million in revenue and a net loss of $100 million for the quarter.\n\nEarlier Thursday, as the Dow hit 20,100 points, Microsoft stock printed a new all-time high of $64.54. The median Street price target on the name is $69 with a high target of $80. Currently ticker boasts 23 ‘Buy’ endorsements, compared to 9 ‘Holds’ and 2 ‘Sell’.\n\nMSFT is up nearly 23 percent year-over-year, and 3.43% year-to-date.\n\n—\n\nGoogle-parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dropped $18.65 to $813.50 in after-hours trading after it reported fiscal results for the fourth-quarter.\n\nIn its quarterly report, the search giant said it earned $9.36 per share, slightly below the $9.62 per share analysts were expecting. Revenue rose 22.2% y/y to $26.06 billion, above views for $25.14 billion. The increase is attributed to advertisers who are spending more to reach an expanding user base that spends more time on smartphones and YouTube.\n\n“Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional — with revenues up 22% year on year and 24% on a constant currency basis., said in a statement Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet, adding “This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube. We’re seeing great momentum in Google’s newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets.”\n\nAlphabet’s “Other Bets” revenue increased to $262 million from $150 million a year earlier.\n\nMountain View also said the “paid clicks” in its Google advertising business rose by 36% compared with a 33% increase in the third quarter, while cost per click declined by 15%.\n\nGOOGL currently prints a one year return of about 15%, and a year-to-date return of 8.14%.', 'Wedbush caught up with Kantar Retail (""KR"") for an investor call Friday to discuss e-commerce marketing trends, with a focus on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a “frenemy” of Alphabet Inc\'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google paid search advertising. Wedbush gives highlights particularly relevant to Alphabet. Amazon Prime (""AP"") is a key driver of the shift of product searches to e-com from search engines. AP has penetrated 37% of U.S. households (""HH""), representing an estimated 55% of U.S. HH purchasing power. Data indicates that membership in AP is a catalyst for AP members to increase their use of Amazon as a default search engine for commercial queries. It is unlikely this trend will reverse in categories where it has taken hold. KR expects Amazon to double down on AP.\n\nThe AP impact on retailer marketer is intuitive enough, shifting ad spending to Amazon\'s platform. This has been a big change over the past year or so. Amazon\'s move into Google Product Listing Ads (""PLAs""), only recent, likely reflects a strategy to drive wider use of AP by current members. Google’s initiatives to increase mobile search monetization, such as through more of the SERP going to PLAs, are a threat to Amazon’s organic search traffic. As Wedbush\'s retail analyst Seth Basham has noted, Amazon has recently begun using Google PLAs in housewares. KR sees here an effort to increase member use of AP, in particular for categories where Amazon believes AP is under-indexing in market share, possibly because AP members simply do not recognize the breadth of AP’s offer. The view was that categories where AMZN will focus on using PLAs may vary over time.\n\nWedbush\'s GOOGL price target remains $700; risks. The firm\'s PT reflects a scenario analysis assuming a risk of material deterioration in paid search economics. Risks to its investment thesis and the attainment of its 12-month PT include: greater-thanexpected ad growth, or higher-than-expected margin; favorable M&A; legal, capital allocation and tech trends (including the failure of predicted threats to become material); and corporate governance given super-voting stock.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this article are subjects of research reports issued recently by investment firms.

It would be the first of “a couple dozen” the company hires, a spokesman said, as DeepMind builds ""a small team"" in the U.S. ""to bridge the gap between Google and our team in London, helping us collaborate even more closely to bring our research breakthroughs to Google users around the world.""\n\nDeepMind has not previously had any researchers based outside of London.\n\n“The Applied team in Mountain View will be made up of a mixture of software engineers and research scientists who work together to solve real-world problems at Google-scale,” according to the job listing.\n\nThe new hires will have their own offices at Google’s headquarters. Google’s other artificial intelligence research division, Google Brain, which uses machine learning to improve several Google products, also has offices on that campus. Both vie for the highly competitive field of artificial intelligence experts.\n\nDeepMind is divided into two divisions, one of which does pure computer science research and another, called its applied division, which tries to build real-world products and services based on artificial intelligence. About three-quarters of DeepMind’s staff of 350 work for the research division, while the rest work for the applied unit.\n\nThe applied division has partnered with the U.K.’s National Health Service on two pilot projects, including one that uses AI to read eye scans. But its primary customer has been Google itself.\n\nThe division used machine learning to figure out how to improve the efficiency of Google’s data centers around the world, resulting in a 40 percent reduction in the amount of energy needed to cool the facilities and a 15 percent improvement in overall power usage efficiency, which measures the power consumed by the data centers’ computers compared with the total energy the facility uses.\n\nDeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, who heads the company’s applied division, has talked about using similar techniques to try to bring efficiency gains to national electricity grids.\n\nThe company has said its AI technology has also been incorporated into unspecified improvements in how Google displays advertising and in the shopping experience in the Google Play store, which sells apps for Google’s Android operating system.\n\nIn the future, Google may seek to incorporate DeepMind’s recent breakthrough in computer-generated speech, using a technique in which the AI system correctly predicts how to form the next part of a sound wave, to Google products such as its personal digital assistant.\n\nThe newly advertised job’s responsibilities include making reinforcement learning --- which uses rewards, such as points in a game, to teach an AI program how to perform a task -- more relevant to solving real-world problems.\n\nDeepMind is perhaps best known for AlphaGo, an AI agent that earlier this year beat one of the world’s reigning champions in the ancient strategy game Go. The victory was considered a major milestone in computer science because Go has too many possible move combinations for a computer to use raw computational power to win. Instead, it must rely on something more akin to human intuition to develop winning strategies.', 'Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is ready to launch its two Android Wear 2.0 Smartwatches according to the famous American blogger and phone leaker, Evan Blass. The new products, Watch Sport and Watch Style will be introduced on Feb 9 alongside other anticipated updates. Rumor has it that the Smartwatches will be powered by the latest version of Android Wear, which is also slated to become available next month. Further claims indicate that Google has been working with LG, efforts that have resulted in the launch of the first ever Smartwatches.\n\nApparently, there has been mixed excitement about Smartwatches and a majority are of the opinion that the 2.0 might just be the savior. Notable features of the LG Smartwatches according to VentureBeat include Google Assistant integration.\n\nMore in terms of features\n\nEach of the models has unique features the likes of a circular 1.2-inch 360×360 pixel display, 512MB of RAM and 240mAh battery for the Watch Style and 1.38-inch 480×480 screen, 768MB of RAM and a 430mAh battery for the Watch Sport.\n\nIn addition, they will both sport built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, features that will facilitate navigation in a similar way to Apple’s iWatch. They will be able to accommodate 4GB of storage.\n\nLaunch of Wear 2.0 delayed by redesigning of OS\n\nThe Android Wear market has been stagnant for a couple of months now. A majority of vendors have been shying away from new products due to the dominance of the older smart watches as well as a lukewarm market. However, the launch of 2.0 would not have come any earlier because on response to the developer’s comments, the need to redesign its OS arose.\n\nNonetheless, a caption on the Wear 2.0 web page states, “Get ready for the next version of Android Wear! Support stand-alone Wear devices and apps. Create enhanced user interaction and glanceable experiences. Test your apps on Wear devices.”\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabets stock closed at $829.02 witnessing an increase $1.56 or 0.19%.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.', 'In a turbulent environment, investors are inclined to put in some extra work to stay on top of the latest market happenings. Analysts and investors are typically highly focused on company earnings numbers when they are published. Company earnings are a good way to analyze the profitability of the company. Sell-side analysts are currently looking for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to post quarterly EPS of $7.2. The company’s next earnings report is expected to be released on or around 2017-04-20 for the period ending on 2017-03-31. The company posted EPS of $6.02 for the same quarter last year. Most recently, the company reported EPS of $7.56. Prior to the last earnings report, Zacks Research had a consensus estimate looking for EPS of $7.65. The gap between the estimate and actual number was $-0.09 which created a surprise factor of -1.18%. The surprise factor can cause substantial stock fluctuations after the earnings release.\n\nCompany earnings results have the capability of triggering near-term stock movements whether results hit or miss expectations. Prior to earnings, investors may be tracking directional trends of provided estimates. The company reported actual earnings per share for the previous quarter of $7.56. The Zacks Research consensus estimate before the earnings report was $7.65. The difference between the estimate and actual was $-0.09 which created a surprise factor of -1.18%.\n\n29 analysts polled by Zacks Research currently have a mean target price of $964.62 on shares. The analyst with the highest target price sees the stock hitting $1100 and the lowest target estimate sees the stock touching $700 within the year. In looking at the standard deviation of all estimates, we arrive at 75.814. Zacks Research also uses an analyst ratings scale that ranges from 1 to 5. Using this scale, a 1 would represent a Strong Buy, and a 5 rating would indicate a Strong Sell rating. Using all the ratings on Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the mean sits at 1.34. Breaking those down we see that the ratings are as follows: 20 Strong Buy, 3 Rated Buy, 1 Rated Hold and 0 Rated Sell.\n\nAnalyst recommendations and estimates are for informational purposes only and should be used along with a number of other factors when considering an investment position.

It has now become a household name since it introduced the smart connected speaker market. A few months ago, Google released its similar offering, the Home speaker, which offers functionality similar to the Echo. While the device was previously available in the US, it will now be coming to the UK in Summer.\n\nAlong with this announcement, Rick Osterloh, Google’s Vice President of Hardware, noted that the device's AI skills and large data would provide it a major edge over the competition.\n\nAmazon's Echo has been available in the US, Germany, and UK since September last year, so the Google Home has a lot of ground to cover. With more manufacturers getting into this product category, it could only be a matter of time before Apple comes up with its offering as well.\n\nAccording to a report from the last year, Apple could be working on a Siri powered accessory which would be equipped with a speaker and mic similar to the aforementioned devices. The device's mic would always be on so as to accept commands for playing music, settings timer, performing searches, and much more.\n\nHowever, a later report conjectured that all of these features would be incorporated into the next version of the Apple TV rather than a standalone device. Bloomberg reported that these features were in testing; however, Analyst Tim Bajarin has noted that Apple may not be working on a separate device using Siri but is trying to make Siri available across its entire device lineup."", 'By Mukta Samtani Published : February 28, 2017\n\nJeff Bezos Is the Unbeatable Edge of AMZN Stock\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock hit a high of $848.64 on Monday and appears to be gradually inching toward another record closing.\n\n“Amazon Studios” just won three Oscars at the 89th Academy Awards, and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos couldn’t be happier. There are many factors supporting AMZN stock, but the most important one is its chief, Bezos.\n\nEven Warren Buffett acknowledges this fact. While the world has been going crazy over Buffett buying Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and airline stocks, the more important story turned out to be the one stock that he missed buying.\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC, the billionaire investor reflected that he really missed the boat on Amazon. He said, “Obviously, I should have bought it long ago,” but he added, “I didn’t understand the power of the model.” (Source: “Warren Buffett on Amazon: ‘I don’t have a good answer’ on why I didn’t buy it long ago,” CNBC, February 27, 2017.)\n\nHe was full of praise for the Amazon founder and CEO, whom he called a “terrific businessperson.” The business acumen of Jeff Bezos is what has transformed an online book seller to an e-commerce and technology powerhouse of today, pushing Amazon stock to $800.00-plus levels.\n\nBezos is never out of great ideas to push Amazon’s growth higher. “Amazon Prime” membership is the best example of this. The privileges that come with a Prime subscription are hard to ignore and, given the competitive pricing, it is hard for customers to not opt for one. The growing number of Prime memberships good proof of this, and has done magic to the impressive rise of AMZN stock.\n\n“Amazon Alexa” was another masterstroke by Jeff Bezos, and the surprise success of the company’s “Echo” line of speakers left many impressed. At a time when everybody thought that Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) would be the leader in digital assistants, Amazon Alexa-powered Echo speakers took the market by storm.\n\nI wrote earlier in Profit Confidential that Amazon Alexa is one of the top reasons to remain bullish on Amazon stock. And, being the super businessperson that he is, Bezos understands that Amazon Alexa needs to be ready as the battle with “Google Assistant” heats up in the near future.\n\nAmazon.com has been taking steps to do just that. Amazon Alexa already supports almost 10,000 skills, with the number likely to climb up further. At the Consumer Electronics Show this year (CES 2017), a number of firms in electronics and household appliances announced their product integration with Alexa. And now another piece of good news come from the 2017 Mobile World Congress (MWC).\n\nMotorola has picked Amazon Alexa as its voice assistant. The company has announced a partnership with Amazon that will see the latter’s voice assistant tech embedded natively into most of Motorola’s devices in the future. (Source: “Motorola picks Amazon’s Alexa as its voice assistant,” TechCrunch, February 26, 2017.)\n\nSpeaking at a press conference at the MWC trade show in Barcelona, Dan Dery, Motorola’s VP global product lead, said, “Later this year will see deep integration of Alexa wake-up words. There won’t be any keys to press, no screen to unlock – you will simply talk to Alexa when the device is around.” He further added that Alexa would be coming to most of their devices. (Source: Ibid.)\n\nThere are also reports that Google Assistant is coming soon on millions of new “Android” devices. Even though Google has an upper hand in search capabilities, it would be interesting to see who emerges as the winner in this battle.\n\nAmazon is betting big on the Alexa platform, and is not leaving any stone unturned to make it the best. Alexa is expected to be a big boost for the company and AMZN stock. The latest piece of news confirms this.\n\nAccording to TIME Magazine, the online retail giant is developing advanced voice recognition for Alexa. Amazon has been developing a feature that would allow its voice assistant to distinguish between individual users based on their voices, according to people familiar with the company’s Alexa strategy. (Source: “Exclusive: Amazon Developing Advanced Voice-Recognition for Alexa,” TIME, February 27, 2017.)\n\nSo far, none of the well-known voice-enabled smart speakers have been able to distinguish who in a family is asking for something. Amazon’s new feature would match the person speaking to a voice sample, or “voice print,” to verify a person’s identity, according to TIME‘s source.\n\nA user could set it so a parent’s voice would be required to make a credit card purchase. This capability is internally named as “Voice ID.” Distinguishing different voices of family members could be a big relief for parents as accidental shopping incidents could be minimized. While Echo speakers currently let the users build multiple profiles, the Voice ID feature would allow them to access their accounts without the need to switch between them or use Alexa app for the same.\n\nThe technology has been completed; it’s just a matter of integrating the feature into Echo products, said one of TIME’s sources. Voice ID could give the Echo a competitive edge against rival “Google Home” and could be a game changer for Amazon stock.\n\nThe below Amazon stock chart shows the phenomenal run of the stock over the last three months.\n\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n\nAnd to end it all on a high note, Amazon’s Manchester by the Sea and The Salesman won three Oscars on Sunday night. Manchester by the Sea won for Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay whereas The Salesman won the Oscar for the Best Foreign Film. Jeff Bezos was present at the ceremony and tweeted his congratulations to the winners.\n\nIt was a historic achievement for the streaming industry as Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) also won its first Oscar for the documentary The White Helmets. Although Netflix has received Oscar nominations in the past, the streaming giant has never been nominated in the Best Picture category.\n\nWith Manchester by the Sea, Amazon took a different approach from other services by releasing the film in traditional theaters before its streaming debut. Amazon reportedly paid $10.0 million for the rights to the movie at the Sundance Film Festival a year ago. The film debuted in November and is set for release on Amazon in May. (Source: “Amazon wins 3 Oscars in a first for streaming audio – and Jeff Bezos gets a fun shout-out,” GeekWire, February 26, 2017.)\n\nWith the strength and potential of “Amazon Prime Video” and Amazon Alexa, both Jeff Bezos and Amazon stock are likely to grab headlines in the coming days. AMZN stock has returned 53% over the last year—as compared to the S&P 500 Index that posted 24% gains in the same time period—and will likely continue inching upwards. Investors have a lot to look forward to this year, and Bezos is expected to be at the top of his game.', 'On the heels of hosting an investor call last week with two expert online marketplace sellers, Peter Cobb of eBags and Jordan Insley of Quick Ship Brands, top analyst Colin Sebastian at Baird is chiming in with bullish calls on three internet giants in his coverage universe: Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nSebastian gleaned new insights into holiday e-commerce trends from the conference call, recognizing these trends point to post-election weakness recovery thanks to robust Cyber-Five growth coupled with mobile traffic. For context, the “Cyber Five” period is the time frame following Thanksgiving through December to-date. Commentary shines the most for Amazon and Facebook, and is “mildly positive” for eBay and Alphabet.\n\nColin Sebastian has a very good TipRanks score with a 68% success rate and he stands at #37 out of 4,283 analysts. Sebastian garners 14.5% in his annual returns. When recommending AMZN, Sebastian earns 32.8% in average profits on the stock. When suggesting FB, Sebastian realizes 18.4%. When rating EBAY, Sebastian yields 11.6%. When advising GOOGL, Sebastian gains 15.3%.\n\nLet’s dive in:\n\nAmazon’s Competitive Edge Likely to Rise\n\nAmazon appears to be in a “strong” position based upon Sebastian’s conversation with Cobb of eBags. Leading him to reiterate an Outperform rating on shares of AMZN with an $850 price target, which represents a just under 10% increase from current levels.\n\nIn fact, the analyst notes that from Cobb’s viewpoint, Amazon rivals its competitor eBay in the spectrum of mobile experience, asserting, “In particular, Mr. Cobb believes that eBay’s mobile experience lags Amazon, as it requires customers to manually sort through a larger number of search results.”\n\nHowever, Sebastian bears in mind, “As Amazon continues to build out private brands across multiple categories, merchants and brands may become increasingly cautious in selling on the platform. While Amazon continues to generate significant order volumes, we note that sellers may, over time, seek out alternative marketplaces and/or develop and nurture their own online retail sites and apps.”\n\n“In the event of another recession, Amazon will likely see its growth reduced again; however, longer term downturns typically increase Amazon’s competitiveness as weaker competitors may be forced out of business or have less capital flexibility to make long-term investments,” the analyst surmises.\n\nTipRanks analytics exhibit AMZN as a Strong Buy. Out of 34 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 32 are bullish on Amazon while 2 remain sidelined. With a return potential of nearly 23%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $950.19.\n\nFacebook is a King of Advertising Spend- Thanks to Mobile and Video\n\nFacebook and Alphabet were among two of the shining lights of the conference call, thanks to domination of ad spend on back of driving forces in mobile and video. Accordingly, the analyst reiterates an Outperform rating on FB without listing a price target.\n\nSebastian accentuates, “Mobile traffic continues to improve and drive an increasing share of visits and engagement, as expected, with merchants allocating larger portions of their advertising budgets to mobile and mobile video despite the lower conversion rates vs. desktop ads. Both executives mentioned video as an increasingly important format to engage with consumers.”\n\nFurthermore, the analyst opines, “With respect to customer acquisition, Google and Facebook are still dominating advertising spend, with mobile video on Facebook emerging this holiday as a new driver of engagement and sales. Separately, eBay CEO Devin Wenig tweeted mobile GMB (gross merchandise bought) share vs. desktop reached 38% on Thanksgiving (up from 35% in 2015), suggesting the growth in mobile traffic has more than offset the related decrease in average order value.”\n\nHowever, with reigning clout also comes the careful watch of government authorities. “Facebook has achieved overwhelming dominance in the bulk of its key markets and consequently is likely to face increased scrutiny from the DOJ, the EU, and other government watchdogs,” Sebastian concludes, positive on the social media giant, but aware of impending risks.\n\nTipRanks analytics indicate FB as a Strong Buy. Based on 38 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 35 rate a Buy on FB while 3 maintain a Hold. The 12-month average price target stands at $157.71, marking a 32% upside from where the stock is currently trading.\n\neBay’s Potential Lies in Forthcoming Platform Updates\n\nWhereas Cobbs of eBags sees weakness in eBay, Insley of Quick Ship Brands sees the company as “healthy and improving, and Sebastian tends to agree. The analyst reiterates an Outperform rating on shares of EBAY with a $35 price target, which represents a close to 20% increase from current levels.\n\nSebastian underscores a general sense of positivity surrounding the platform, as he believes, “Overall, commentary around the planned updates to eBay’s platform seemed optimistic, as merchants and brands anticipate better organic search visibility as a result of improved product/category indexing. In particular, Mr. Cobb believes that eBay’s mobile experience lags Amazon, as it requires customers to manually sort through a larger number of search results. As eBay structured data initiatives progress through 2017, he expects to see better product visibility from both an SEO and on-site search standpoint, giving customers more relevant results and alleviating some of the biggest challenges for marketplace sellers.\n\n“eBay has previously disclosed that the marketplace hosts over a billion live product listings, and many sellers find it difficult to stand out, particularly in crowded product categories. By introducing improved sorting and filtering tools, eBay will seek to streamline the shopping experience for customers while giving sellers greater product exposure,” the analyst contends, anticipating that enhanced customer mobile experience will bode well for the e-commerce and online auction giant.\n\nTipRanks analytics demonstrate EBAY as a Buy. Out of 23 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 9 are bullish on eBay stock, 11 remain sidelined, and 3 are bearish on the stock. With a return potential of nearly 14%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $33.21.\n\nAlphabet’s Big Threat: Facebook\n\nGoogle, much like Facebook, has made great strides in mobile and video, with robust growth in Search, a key to winning in both mobile advertising as well as customer acquisition, which are on a surge in expectation of rising volumes.\n\nTherefore, the analyst picks Alphabet as his fourth bullish call, reiterating an Outperform rating on GOOGL without listing a price target.\n\nHowever, like Facebook, Sebastian is wary that success will bear anti-trust and regulatory-related risks, warning, “As Google’s dominance has grown in Search, the DOJ has increased scrutiny of the company’s activities. This may hamper Google’s competitiveness in the future.”\n\nMoreover, Facebook remains a viable threat to Alphabet, as Sebastian predicts “Facebook may also, over time, compete in search, by using its social network data to augment a search index compiled of public web data.” Additionally, “It is possible that Facebook will launch a third-party Display Network to compete with Google’s network, and thereby take market share,” the analyst adds.\n\nOverall, though Sebastian nonetheless maintains buying opportunity is still compelling for GOOGL, he remains more confident on Facebook in the long-term.\n\nTipRanks analytics show GOOGL as a Strong Buy. Based on 28 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 26 rate a Buy on GOOGL, 1 maintains a Hold, while 1 issues a Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $968.33, marking a 19% upside from where the stock is currently trading.', ""Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported net revenue of $21.2bn (up 23% y/y), better than Bank of America Merrill Lynch's $20.7bn and the Street at $20.6bn.

Non-GAAP EPS of $9.36 was below BAML's $9.77 and the Street at $9.63, but was due to a ~$0.36 impact from 1x equipment charges and $0.44 est. from higher taxes.

That said, 2H16 deceleration of 5.5% is not bad vs the 6.3% acceleration in 2H15, and on a 2year combined growth basis, 4Q growth was down < 1% vs 3Q. Bank of America Merrill Lynch sees opportunity for stable to re-accelerating growth in 2H17 as comps ease and GDP potentially accelerates.

The firm's upward revisions are primarily driven by higher growth assumptions for Cloud, Hardware, and Play, partially offset by lower margins. Excluding Other Bets losses, BAML's 2017E core Google EPS goes to $45.38 (previously $45.21) and 2018 to $52.67 (previously $51.05). BAML raised its 2017 GAAP EPS to $32.59 from $32.19 and 2018 to $37.26 from $36.68.\n\nWhile the lack of Website upside was disappointing, overall growth trends remain solid and core margin contraction was better than feared. BAML is encouraged with the strong showing for emerging drivers in Cloud and Hardware and is optimistic on continued YouTube strength. BAML reiterated its Buy and PO of $1,025 based on 17x core Google non-GAAP EPS (ex-Other Bets) plus cash, or 21x core Google GAAP EPS plus cash.\n\n\n\nThe companies mentioned in this article are subjects of research reports issued recently by investment firms.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). Canaccord analyst Michael Graham has been out with a mostly positive forecast for the quarter. However, on three of the four, the analyst reigned in the price target on stocks he has nonetheless hailed as “beacons of growth.”\n\nThe big four were all down in market trading on Wednesday afternoon. Even so, the analyst is riding the bullish train for the long-term as he sees these stocks as leaders of the large-cap tech-verse, particularly considering that “three of the FANGs comprise half of the six fast-growing large-cap tech stocks.”\n\nWhat are the drivers for these tech giants in terms of growth? Graham cites four crucial wave makers: digital advertising, digital video consumption, eCommerce, and cloud services. From where the analyst is standing, the drivers remain “very much intact” and therefore, growth should sustain, and as revenue growth continues to be steady, “investors keep returning.”\n\nAs far as Graham sizes up Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google, he asserts, “The FANG stocks have had two very strong years, outperforming the market by a wide margin. The stocks had a more mixed Q3, with more diverse performance following earnings, and a group-wide (short-lived) selloff following President-elect Trump’s victory. We still think these stocks will perform well through 2017, although we recommend fine-tuning relative exposure within the group based on your time horizon.”\n\nWhy should you trust Graham’s opinion? According to TipRanks, five-star analyst Michael Graham is ranked #241 out of 4,243 analysts. Graham has a 52% success rate and garners 8.6% in his annual returns. When recommending FB, Graham earns 22.9% in average profits on the stock. When suggesting AMZN, Graham gains 7.1%. When rating NFLX, Graham realizes 20.1%. When advising GOOGL, Graham yields 14.0%.\n\nLet’s explore the stocks that make up the crux of the tech court:\n\nFacebook Global User Base Still Growing by 15%- Impressive\n\nWith regards to Facebook, Graham sees the social media titan facing the greatest impact now that companies, investors, and regulators alike are choosing to shift focus from non-GAAP to GAAP metrics.\n\nEven so, the analyst advises to buy in light of the titan’s “multi-faceted revenue growth story” which features a well-rounded arc of users, engagement, ad load, ad pricing, as well as newer services.\n\nWhile there are a couple of risks, from ad load warnings to near-term concerns from advertisers who might be wary of issues with measurement, Graham reiterates a Buy on FB while trimming the price target from $160 to $150, which represents a close to 30% increase from where the shares last closed.\n\nMeanwhile, advertisers are corralling to the platform, to the tune of 4 million as of third-quarter, thanks to global user and monthly active user (MAU) growth as well as some enhanced engagement with “dramatic” possibilities to gain further abroad.\n\nThe analyst opines, “We dusted off our 2013 initiation report on FB in which we estimated 2017 ad revenue at $17.6B. Our current estimate for next year is more than double that number at $37.5B, and while we are patting ourselves on the back with one hand for recommending this juggernaut for 3+ years, with the other hand we are scratching our head trying to figure out how we so dramatically underestimated FB’s potential.”\n\nUltimately, “Investors seem to still be largely focused on revenue for FB, and we continue to be comfortable with the outlook. We are modeling 35% ad revenue growth in 2017, down from 61% in 2016, and we believe this should be easily achievable given the multiple drivers,” Graham surmises.\n\nTipRanks analytics exhibit FB as a Strong Buy. Out of 38 analysts polled in the last 3 months by TipRanks, 35 are bullish on Facebook stock, while 3 remain sidelined. With a return potential of 37%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $158.03.\n\nAmazon Prime Flywheel Presents Buying Opportunity\n\nAs the Amazon Prime flywheel fires up eCommerce growth rates and surges in scale and volume drive increases in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Graham likes the prospects for a “manageable competitive environment.”\n\nTherefore, despite awareness of margin pressure and a “price war” brewing for AWS that could prominently shake up margins, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of AMZN while pulling back on the price target from $900 to $875, which represents a just under 18% increase from current levels.\n\nAs the analyst deduces, “Steady growth in eCommerce revenue has been largely taken for granted by investors over the last couple of years, and this is even more true so far in 2016, when eCommerce revenue growth both internationally and domestically has stayed above 26%. This has been the result of excellent execution around selection, price, and fulfillment. More recently, however, management commentary has centered on the ‘Prime Flywheel’ which involves even faster, free shipping and a variety of other services (‘free shipping with Netflix and Spotify thrown in for free…’).”\n\nGuesstimating two-thirds of eCommerce revenue for the online auction and e-commerce leader likely stems from the U.S. coupled with 65% of Prime members, or roughly 43.5 million, in the U.S., out of a projected total of 70 million Prime members from 350 million customer accounts, the analyst likes Amazon’s positioning.\n\n“We believe Prime is the lens through which Amazon management is viewing the company’s opportunity,” Graham postulates.\n\nTipRanks analytics demonstrate AMZN as a Strong Buy. Based on 35 analysts polled in the last 3 months by TipRanks, 33 rate a Buy on AMZN, while 2 maintain a Hold. The 12-month average price target stands at $946.39, marking a 27% upside from where the stock is currently trading.\n\nNetflix: One-Two Punch of Original Content Value and International Expansion Possibility\n\nMeanwhile, Graham commends Netflix for its substantial runway ahead in terms of potential development internationally and sees the streaming giant’s original content as key, comparing its importance to the likes of fulfillment for Amazon.\n\nAs such, amid concerns of competition, subscriber comp challenges awaiting the first half of 2017, and deficient support for valuation in the short-term, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on NFLX with a $140 price target, which represents an 18% increase from where the shares last closed.\n\nThe analyst notes, “Netflix launched in its first international market (Canada) in 2010. It then launched across most countries in Latin America in 2011 and several countries in Western Europe in 2012. We estimate that the largest single international markets by subscribers are the U.K., Canada, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, and Japan currently.”\n\nAdditionally, Graham sees, “Along with these top markets, there are several other opportunities from recent launches and emerging economies. Due to Western Europe’s mature economy and media landscape, we think these markets could ramp faster. Specifically, the Nordics, France, Spain, and Italy all seem poised for greater near-term adoption.”\n\nOverall, “We think Netflix’s international expansion is still very much in the early stages. While the top international markets are at ~12% penetration, layering in newer mature markets and some of the larger emerging one shows that Netflix is still merely in mid-single digit penetration of the total addressable market,” Graham determines.\n\nTipRanks analytics indicate NFLX as a Buy. Out of 37 analysts polled in the last 3 months by TipRanks, 20 are bullish on Netflix stock, 11 remain sidelined, and 6 are bearish on the stock. With a return potential of 5%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $123.29.\n\nAlphabet (Google): Re-Accelerating Website Revenue Key to Success\n\nAs Alphabet’s stock has been circling a 40% rise from summertime 2015, Graham is banking on the company’s ad innovation and website revenue growth as key drivers to maintain full confidence ahead. As YouTube’s evolution spirals forward and in face of prospective multiple expansion, the analyst likes the tech giant’s odds over the risk of Mobile, Programmatic, and YouTube applying pressure to gross margins.\n\nTherefore, Graham reiterates a Buy on shares of GOOGL while cutting the price target from $950 to $925, which represents a 21% increase from where the stock is currently trading.\n\nA key to GOOGL’s success lies in its website revenue growth, as the analyst explains, “We believe the most important driver of this move has been the re-acceleration of Websites revenue growth, which progressed from 13% in Q2/15 to 16% in Q3 and 20% in Q4. This important growth rate then stayed well above 20% so far this year, and this is an important psychological level for the stock.”\n\nMoreover, Graham considers, “The likely key driver of this resurgence in growth has been essentially ad load on both mobile search and YouTube (discussed below), with the company adding a third mobile search ad unit that started gaining traction in Q2/15 but really hit its stride in Q3.”\n\nUltimately, “We estimate YouTube revenue growth will decelerate from 48% in 2016 to 37% in 2017, but at ~15% of Websites revenue next year, this relatively high growth rate is an important tailwind. We estimate that YouTube will be 18% of Websites revenue in 2020. As it grows larger in the mix, its higher growth rate than search revenue should help buoy the overall top-line for many years,” Graham concludes.\n\nTipRanks analytics show GOOGL as a Strong Buy. Based on 27 analysts polled in the last 3 months by TipRanks, 26 rate a Buy on GOOGL while 1 issues a Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $968.33, marking a nearly 27% upside from where the shares last closed.', 'Based on the latest analyst predictions Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is estimated to grow its earnings 18% over the next year. What should potential investors be aware of? I’m going to investigate the latest data and look into some metrics you shouldn’t overlook. View our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nCan we expect GOOG to keep growing?\n\nInvestors in Alphabet have been patiently waiting for the uptick in earnings and if you believe the 37 analysts covering the stock then the next 3 years will be very interesting. We are expecting to see the earnings grow around 62.9% and earnings per share estimates range from $37.57 to $63.51.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the same period we will see the revenue increase from $90.27 Billion to $153.93 Billion in 2020 and net income is predicted to grow from $19,478 M to $45,802 M in 2020, roughly growing 2.4x. Margins are predicted to be extremely healthy during this time as well.\n\nIs the growth built on solid basis?\n\nAlphabet has underperformed the average growth in earnings of the Software industry over the past year.\n\nWhilst GOOG’s Return on Equity of 15% isn’t horrific, it means that the company has underperformed the Software industry average of 22.72%. This is expected to slightly improve with analysts expecting ROE in 3 years to be 17.9%.\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn on equity (ROE) is a measure of how much profit (net income) a company makes as a percentage of the shareholders equity. Equity is made up of funds from the original issuing of shares and any retained earnings from previous financial years. It varies considerably across sectors, for this reason it is important to asses a stocks ROE relative to its industry. Whilst it is true that the higher the ROE the better the company is performing, ROE does have a weakness. A stock with a disproportionate amount of debt can lead to a small equity base. Thus, a small amount of net income (the numerator) could still produce a high ROE off a modest equity base (the denominator). For this reason investors should always consider the debt situation in conjunction with ROE.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlphabet is a fast growing company, but as Warren Buffett’s right-hand man Charlie Munger said, “No matter how wonderful a business is, it’s not worth an infinite price“. Is GOOG overpriced? Or could it be considered an undervalued opportunity?

A “Buy” rating does not mean that every investor should acquire the stock. Nor does a “Sell” rating mean that every investor should immediately sell it. Your own financial situation and investment needs are what matter. If you consider any individual rating, do not views it in absolute or abstract terms, but in the context of your own unique financial situation. In short, whatever a given analyst recommendation may say, always consider whether a particular investment is right for you in light of your own financial circumstances.

It is recently reported that tech mammoth is working on new features for its Google Home\'s Assistant app in a bid to enable the users to play any content from Netflix on Google Chromecast using voice command.\n\nThe company is also planning to integrate Google Photos in its Home Assistant app. The news has ignited excitement among the users, and many tech experts believe that the main aim of the tech giant behind this move is to pose a serious threat to Amazon Echo. It was recently reported that several users started experiencing a new ""Videos and Photos"" option in their Google Home Assistant settings. Many tech gurus believe that the new option will likely feature all the future video streaming content that will work with Google Assistant.\n\nThe move indicates that the search engine giant is pretty serious towards achieving its market ventures in the home automation industry. Also, many experts believe that this move will help the company get many users to switch to its platform. Adding to that, it is pertinent to mention that the update has not been made available to all the users. However, many tech experts believe that the update will arrive soon.\n\nFor now, reports that are making rounds in the tech space indicate that only Netflix video content could be played on Google Home\'s voice command, but many believe Google has plans in its pipeline to bring other online streaming platforms like Hulu on its platform. Also, the search engine giant is making its efforts to offer improved features to the users in a bid to create traction among them to buy its Google Home device.', 'Google is working to create new shopping experiences for consumers. The company announced retail partnerships with BMW and Gap Inc. to use its augmented reality (AR) platform Project Tango and work towards creating a shopping experience in which shoppers do not need to be physically present at the retail outlet, but they can choose products as if they were.\n\n“We see a lot of use of this technology in retail, for measuring your garage or buying big-ticket items like kitchens for example,” Eric Johnsen, business development executive, augmented reality at Google, spoke at CES in Las Vegas on Wednesday, where the deals were announced.\n\nTango uses computer vision comprising of technologies such as 3D mapping, motion-tracking and AR instead of GPS to help devices sense their environments.\n\nGoogle’s technology venture will use cameras and sensors in smartphone to create digital images in physical spaces, the best example of which is the AR game Pokémon Go.\n\nWhile Google’s deal with Gap Inc. will help consumer shop in Gap stores just like they would usually do — checking out and trying out merchandize, its deal with BMW is a little different.\n\nWith BMW, Google is trying out an AR app which will display its i3 and i8 cars on smartphone screens.\n\nCar buyers will be able to check out superimposed vehicles and will not just be able to choose from different colors, trims and wheels but will also be able to place a high-resolution image of the vehicle inside their garage or driveway. BMW says that the app will be available at dealerships globally.', 'Google is rolling out a real world application for its most ambitious virtual-reality effort: letting shoppers see what they might buy without leaving home.\n\nThe Alphabet Inc. unit on Wednesday introduced two new retail partnerships, with BMW and Gap Inc., deploying its 3D-scanning project called Tango. The technology uses cameras and sensors in mobile devices to overlay digital images in physical space – akin to the hit mobile game Pokemon Go. The retail deals announced at the consumer technology show CES in Las Vegas hint at Google’s broader ambition to merge its mapping capabilities with its core business of facilitating commerce.\n\nAs virtual- and augmented-reality technology rapidly improves, analysts predict the retail industry may be one the biggest beneficiaries. IDC estimates the market for the technologies will explode from about $5.2-billion (U.S.) in 2015 to $162-billion in 2020. Car dealerships will be “one of the longer-term, more profitable use cases,” said IDC analyst Chris Chute, as auto makers look for way to reach customers who are increasingly less likely to enter traditional outlets.\n\nBMW is testing a new app that displays an i3 city vehicle and i8 sports car on smartphone screens. Car shoppers can walk around the superimposed vehicles, placing it to look life-size inside their driveway or garage. Users can choose from six different colours, four types of trims and wheels, all appearing in a high-resolution image.\n\nThe Munich-based luxury auto maker said the mobile app will be available at dealerships in 11 countries. “It’s possible we’ll develop a kind of library of models for this app,” said Stefan Biermann, head of innovations for sales for BMW.\n\nAt a recent presentation in Munich, the display image of an i3, even on a small phone screen, was convincing enough for users to duck and lift their legs to step inside the vehicle, where they could push a button to turn on the lights and the radio.\n\n“We see a lot of use of this technology in retail, for measuring your garage or buying big-ticket items like kitchens for example,” Eric Johnsen, who heads business development for augmented reality at Google, said at the event.\n\nBloomberg News reported earlier that Google plans to use the indoor mapping capability of Tango to generate advertising revenue. Mr. Johnsen said Google isn’t getting revenue from sales with its newly announced partnerships, but declined to comment further on business plans.\n\nOn top of the BMW app, Google announced two more developments for Tango on Wednesday. A new app allows shoppers to test clothes from the Gap brand using Tango. And Google added a new hardware partner: The Zenphone from Asustek Computer Inc. is now compatible with Tango’s technology.\n\nHowever, both announcements reveal the limitations of Google’s efforts. For one, there aren’t many consumers that can try it out. The Asus Zenfone is only the second model to enable Tango, following a device from Lenovo Group Ltd.\n\nAnd it’s still incomplete for consumers that try the technology. With the mobile app for Gap, for instance, shoppers try on outfits using a 3D digital avatar, rather than superimpose the clothes on their bodies. The latter tactic might arrive eventually, but the tech needed is still in its infancy.\n\n“Producing content for these mediums is extremely hard,” said Shanna Tellerman, founder of Modsy, a startup that uses three-dimensional technology for e-commerce. “It often looks a little bit janky.”\n\nGoogle is aware of the problem. In addition to challenges with realistic rendering, mobile 3D mapping is constrained by difficulties imposed by lighting and geographic space, said Johnny Lee, director of engineering for Tango. The gap between expectations of the technology and its reality can do more harm than good.\n\n“When people think about augmented reality, they think of science-fiction quality effects,” he said.\n\nThat’s also the rationale behind Google’s cautious implementation of Tango on devices, Mr. Lee explained. While the company ultimately plans for the tech to function inside every mobile device, it now doesn’t reach a vast majority of Android smartphones.\n\nHardware changes demanded from Tango’s sensors also may give Google’s manufacturing partners pause. However, that might change if the tech becomes ubiquitous. Other software companies – Microsoft Corp., Facebook Inc. and Snap Inc. – are investing heavily in augmented and virtual reality. Apple Inc. hasn’t revealed any plans for AR, but CEO Tim Cook has touted the technology publicly multiple times. It’s unlikely Apple would allow Google’s Tango to operate on its iPhones.\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. is certainly thinking about virtual reality shopping too, said Mr. Chute, the IDC analyst.\n\nAll these companies, however, must grapple with the dual challenge of mastering the necessary tech and, more critically, finding an actual market.\n\n“Hardware ain’t easy,” Mr. Chute said. “What works in a closed environment, in (Silicon) Valley, doesn’t necessarily work in the real world.”\n\nReport Typo/Error', 'Waymo LLC, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) asked a federal court on Friday to halt Uber Technologies Inc.’s efforts to develop autonomous vehicles allegedly based on stolen design secrets.

(NASDAQ:FB) has been in the eye of storm recently due to issues like fake news and overstatement of metrics. However, advertisers are not going to flee its platform. In fact, Facebook is slowly taking the fight to industry leader Alphabet Inc\'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in terms of online video viewership and advertising. New Research also shows that video content is outperforming all other types on Facebook. Here\'s how Facebook is edging closer to YouTube, slowly and steadily reducing its web video supremacy.\n\nFacebook Is Challenging YouTube And TV For Ads\n\nFacebook has been testing the introduction of a dedicated video tab inside its mobile app among a select group of users over the past year - a move Morgan Stanley analysts predict will help the social network capture a greater share of the TV ad market. This move will also help Facebook take on Youtube, trying to become a complete web video portal. This may also eliminate Facebook\'s weakness in the delivery of video content, which is still very much focused on distribution and in-feed viewing. Whereas YouTube benefits from discovery and intent.\n\nYouTube’s biggest strength is its ability to offer customers a continuous viewing experience across multiple connected devices. Facebook seems to have come up with an answer to this as well with another of their recent move. Its new feature allows live streaming of videos on your TV. 85% of videos on Facebook are watched without sound where as Youtube has a more immersive experience. YouTube thus serves as a more complete, cinematic experience than Facebook. If the new dedicated video tab becomes operational then this competitive advantage of Youtube can be reduced to a great extent.\n\nTV ad revenue in the US totaled close to $70 billion in 2015, according to PwC’s Media Outlook. Consumers continue to increase their time spent consuming digital media, which has put pressure on traditional TV ad spenders to increase their ad budgets on digital channels like Youtube and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). The dedicated video tab will solve advertisers reservations about Facebook videos being too fragmented and interspersed between feeds. So Facebook may take a huge pie of digital video advertising revenue from Youtube.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nHow Close Can FB Get To YouTube\n\nThe category YouTube belongs to is ""Google websites,"" which contributed $16.1B or 72.3% of the Google segment top-line in 3Q16. It is not clear actually how much YouTube contributes to top line figures, but it is estimated to be around $3.1B for 3Q16 by Wedbush. Youtube is expected to grow at a CAGR of 30% through 2020. However, slowly and steadily Facebook is catching up. Recently it was reported that Facebook overtook YouTube for Christmas social video campaigns in UK. 90% of all interactions and 60% of all views of Christmas TV adverts on social were via Facebook, while just under 40% of views were on YouTube, proving Facebook is where audiences head to watch and share the content they love.\n\nAlso Read: FB Stock: Facebook Inc Could Gain The Most From A Snapchat IPO In 2017\n\nIn the US alone digital video advertising is estimated to be worth $23.5B by 2020, then the global market size is much bigger. There were 3.1 Trillion Facebook video views between November 2015 and November 2016; that\'s a staggering increase of 94% year-on-year. With Facebook users spending an average of 50 minutes per day on the site, and over 100 million hours of daily video watch time, the reach and influence of Facebook video content is only set to increase.\n\nThough some of these numbers may not be very accurate due to Facebook\'s overstated metrics. Even if you go by moderate projections of these numbers, Facebook is well positioned to take on Youtube in digital video advertising space. The ever increasing market size gives these two players enough reasons to fight for.\n\nThe Next Big Digital Ad Revenue Battle Is On Videos\n\nMost of the consumer internet traffic in the future will be around video. According to a Cisco Forecast, videos will represent 69% of all consumer-based Internet traffic by 2017; this is expected to rise to 80% by 2019. Zuckerburg himself has said, “I think video is a megatrend, almost as big as mobile.”\n\nThe only place in videos where Facebook is lagging drastically is original content creation, but here it is taking the Youtube way by paying both individual celebrities and news outlets to use it. There are also recent reports of some famous content creators leaving Youtube and music industry not being happy with payments from Youtube, so Facebook has a ray of hope here as well. (See Also: FB Stock: Don\'t Sell Facebook Inc Stock, But Do Read This )\n\nThe US digital advertising industry will continue to experience remarkable growth through 2021 to reach nearly $100 billion in annual revenue, driven primarily by the sustained migration of ad dollars from traditional TV to digital video and the continued increase in social spending. Digital video advertising will grow faster than any other segment over the next five years, as consumers shift time spent online to phones and tablets. So we are definitely headed for a ‘war for video supremacy\' going ahead.\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nIt will also be difficult to change consumers\' default habit of going to YouTube for video content, but for that Facebook needs to come up with the right video offering which will entice both consumers as well as advertisers.\n\nFacebook will deliver close to $31 billion in revenue in 2017 going by a slower growth of 25% over Facebook\'s TTM sales number. Its sales number can shoot up drastically if it captures a sizeable chunk of the digital video ad revenue going forward and FB stock would gain from this in a big way.\n\nOffering a dedicated connected viewing and search experience is no doubt on the cards. If it can achieve this successfully and maintain its push into premium content, then Facebook may take the top spot as a complete entertainment and social hub. It\'s really a daunting task to go after YouTube, but the future looks bright for Facebook Inc.\n\nLooking for tech stocks?

(NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nOnline holiday sales proved to be good to these internet giants, as sales are tracking to the analyst’s growth projections of 16% to 18%. However, when looking at this week’s context of the market as a whole, the stocks underperformed.\n\nYoussef Squali has a very good TipRanks score with a 68% success rate and he stands at #27 out of 4,274 analysts. Squali garners 10.3% in his yearly returns. When recommending FB, Squali earns 24.3% in average profits on the stock. When suggesting AMZN, Squali gains 25.8%. When rating GOOGL, Squali realizes 10.2%.\n\n“While Internet stocks rose this week, the index trailed the overall market, reflecting continued rotation into Financials, Energy, Industrials and other categories positioned to benefit most from the President-elect Trump win. YTD the group remains ahead, however, up 21.2% Y/Y,” Squali notes.\n\nGlancing at the bigger picture and thanks to “the strength season-to-date,” the analyst sings the praises of these three key players in the tech sector.\n\n“We feel comfortable with our forecast for 16-18% Y/Y growth in total online sales over the holiday period and continue to view AMZN, FB and GOOGL as prime beneficiaries,” Squali contends.\n\nAs such, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of FB with a $170 price target, which represents just under a 43% increase from current levels.\n\nIn regards to Amazon, a big morsel of news was the unveiling of Amazon Go, a physical store that allows customers to shop for household items without requiring them to check out, with plans for a first store to open in Seattle at the start of 2017.\n\nThe store’s technology will maximize computer vision, sensor fusion, combined with deep learning to allow consumers to pick up and put away items in their shopping bags to carry out once ready to go, thanks to a virtual shopping cart’s tracking abilities.\n\nSquali believes, “While the concept could be potentially disruptive to retail over time, we note that Amazon plans to debut the store initially in Seattle and that a wider rollout could be some time away. We believe that Amazon will likely use this as a test location to refine the offering and gauge consumers’ responses/adoption before rolling it out on a broader basis.”\n\nMeanwhile, online sales, specifically desktop, charged forward 13% year-over-year for Cyber Week, according to comScore data.\n\n“While this is below the 15% Y/Y growth over the Thanksgiving weekend (Nov. 24-27), when the peak shopping season kicked off, it’s still 200bps above the 11% Y/Y growth pre-Thanksgiving, attesting to an elevated level of consumer spending during the peak holiday season (so far),” Squali highlights.\n\nTherefore, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on AMZN with a price target of $1,000, which represents a 30% increase from where the shares last closed.\n\nAdditionally, Squali maintains full bullish steam ahead for Alphabet after an investor conference has highlighted strides toward live television, on back of a strategic alliance with YouTube. The analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of GOOGL with a $1,040 price target, which represents a 30% increase from where the stock is currently trading.\n\n“GOOGL, AMZN take aim at traditional cable bundles. CBS CEO disclosed at an investor conference this week that the company had “been able to make a deal with Youtube”, suggesting that Google is making progress in its efforts to bring an over-the-top subscription offering for live TV. Separately, Amazon announced that Prime members would be able to subscribe to HBO and Cinemax for $15/mo and $10/mo, respectively, via Amazon Channels. The latest moves highlights ambitions of Internet companies as consumers spend more time online and cord-cutting picks up,” Squali surmises.', 'The search engine giant, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, came under the spotlight again as it released the first beta build of Android 7.1.2 on Monday. The new version of Android is currently available for Pixel, Pixel C, Pixel XL, Nexus 5X and Nexus Player and reports indicate that the update will soon be available for Nexus 6P.\n\nThe search engine giant claims to have many new innovative features and improved performance in its recent Android update.

Also, the tech giant mentioned in its blog post that the new version of Android is “an incremental maintenance release focused on refinements.""\n\nMoreover, as the competition in the smartphone industry continues to surge at a fast pace, it seems that Google is making efforts to muster significant amount of market share by offering new and improved features to its users.

However, those using Pixel can update their device to the newly released beta program.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Google’s main rival, Apple, experienced a drop in the sales of iPhone for the first time during the last fiscal year.

In any case, it is yet to be seen whether the Android update will help the tech titan in enticing users to buy its Pixel devices.', 'Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL):\n\nLast Trade:\n\nAlphabet Inc.

On a Y/Y basis, F/X should result in a 90bps hit to top line growth vs. management’s assumption for a 60bps tailwind.

Currently, analysts believe Apple will earn more than $10 per share next year and achieve a forward PE ration of only 11.6. They argue that Apple seems like a very cheap investment based on this low multiple and its huge net cash position. Can we really trust analysts’ estimates? Are they really skilled at predicting what will happen in 10, 5, or even 2 years into the future?\n\nAnalysts keep predicting about companies almost daily. In a huge influx of news and updates, these predictions usually get buried over time. In this article we have decided to throw back to 2014 and see how the predictions made by notable analysts and investors about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Gilead Sciences, Inc.(NASDAQ:GILD) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) turned out down the road.\n\nApple Or Russia?\n\nOn December 22, 2014, Paul Gambles, managing partner at the financial advisory group MBMG Group, said in an interview to CNBC that he’d prefer buying Russia than owning Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s shares after the Russian economy crashed amid sanctions put on the country following its aggression in the Eastern Ukraine. Gambles had called investing in the Moscow stock index a “high risk opportunity”, citing valuations of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Russia’s equities.\n\nThe context of this speculation is interesting. In November that year, Bloomberg’s Srinivasan Sivabalan had published a report which said that if an investor had owned Apple’s stock, they could have sold it and bought the entire Russian stock market, still having enough money to buy an iPhone 6 Plus for the entire Russian population (143.5 million). The Kremlin’s political conflicts, sanctions and economic stagnation had resulted in Russian equities plummeting by $234 billion to $531 billion in 2014, while Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s value had skyrocketed by $147 billion to $652 billion in the same period.\n\nIt seems the investor would have lost a fortune had he invested in Russia in 2014, because the world’s largest country is still suffering from a crippling financial crisis, with no end in sight. Russia has been operating at a deficit since 2012, while its Federal Reserve will go dry 2017. The country still depends upon oil, gas and raw material exports for a major chunk of revenue. As of 2015, oil and gas accounted for a whopping 43% of the government’s revenue.\n\nHowever, the election of Donald Trump and oil prices finally going above $50 a barrel gave the Russian economy a much needed respite recently. The Moscow Exchange has gained about 12% since the US election, while S&P 500 is up 5.9% in the same period. VanEck Vectors Russia ETF has grown by 33% to $2.5 billion since November 29, while the iShares MSCI Russia ETF assets are up by 16% to $438 million. Russia’s RTS Index was down by over 48% since the start of 2014 till the date of the interview, while the index is down just by 0.70% year-to-date in 2016. An upcoming Pro Russian team in the White House, especially Donald Trump’s selection of Rex Tillerson, who was awarded the Order of Friendship in 2013 by Vladimir Putin, for the position of Secretary of State, signals a welcoming future for Russia, and analysts think that there is a chance that the new US government will ease up sanctions on the country. If the Don lifts sanctions from Russia and oil continues to rally, Gambles’ speculation might prove correct.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to be the juggernaut in the tech world, but there are signs the company is losing steam, mainly from its primary product, iPhone. In April the company posted its first ever sales and profit drop in a decade. Apple’s manufacturers in China and Taiwan said they received less orders from the company, due to the market saturation and lack of new features to come up to the users’ expectations. Earlier this month, a Taiwan-based manufacturer of Apple told Digitimes that the Apple slashed its orders for iPhone 7. Apple’s stock was trading around $113 a share on December 22, 2014, while its current price is $116.29.\n\nFollow Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Follow Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Trade (NASDAQ:AAPL) Now!', 'Over the past year, VR has grown immensely as an industry. 360-degree videos and virtual reality content have also taken off, and VR is now available on desktop PCs, smartphones and even consoles with the PSVR.

With this, digital advertising has suddenly witnessed a major boom with two of the largest tech companies capturing a lion share of the market. Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are claiming the throne in the digital ad market, Cantor Fitzgerald contends in a research report released today.\n\nThe firm’s observation of growth trends for the two tech giants reveals that they have been driving ""a disproportionate share"" of the revenue growth being garnered into the digital advertising industry. The firm goes on to say that next year, Google and Facebook will together account for “virtually 100% of all incremental dollars” generated in the industry.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald talks about the great deal of creativity and innovation that is coming from these two tech players. This trend further suggests that digital advertisers aren’t going to spend their dollars on all other competing platforms either. Rather, they’d prefer getting their ads published in the best medium possible i.e. Facebook and Google. The firm, therefore, expects to spend on all other competing platforms likely to remain flat for next year and may see a decline beginning 2018.\n\n“We remain constructive on Goolge and Facebook given their massive, yet expanding audiences/reach, their data and highly engaging mobile and video ad formats, all at a compelling valuation, in our view,” writes Cantor Fitzgerald in its research report.\n\nFurthermore, the firm believes that Google and Facebook would command nearly two-third of all global digital ad spend for the current year and the next. Google would command 46.5% and 47.5% of total global digital ad revenue in 2016 and 2017. While Facebook is growing faster considerably, it falls as a decisive second at 15.7% and 19.2% share for 2016 and 2017, respectively. However, together, these companies represent and control almost 2/3 of all global spending on digital ads currently. The firm writes that this trend may become problematic for traditional advertisers and ad agencies if it continues to sustain longer term.\n\nOne of the striking reasons for these two companies to have grown much faster than the entire sector on average is their scale and size. Both these bigger peers have become faster helped by a positive and greater network effect on usage and daily average users. High momentum around their product innovations has also contributed to reaching out to much wider audiences, thus inducing spending by digital ad industry.', 'A total of 200 publishers were removed from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ad networks following an increase in so-called fake news. The publishers were banned in the fourth quarter of 2016 in line with an update to an existing policy that sought to deter websites from offering misleading content. Who determines what content is misleading and how is the ultimate question.\n\nOn Google’s ad network it is common for advertisers to be ejected if they are found to have provided misleading or false claims. Following the proliferation of so-called fake news in 2016, offending sites were added to the blacklist.\n\nPopular vote controversy\n\nGoogle is on record for having been on the receiving end after it featured a news item from a supposed false news site. The news item alleged that Donald Trump had beaten Hillary Clinton in the popular vote count when in fact she had garnered close to three million votes more than him. Not all the publishers who were banned were purveyors of this kind of news, though.\n\nAs per the ‘bad ads’ report which Google releases at the start of every year, some of the publishers who were banned in the months of December and November last year included websites that impersonated established news media organizations. Some of the impersonators took advantage of truncated top-level domains such as ‘.co’ instead of ‘.com’. Google did not, however, list the offending sites.\n\nGoogle’s annual ‘bad ads’ report also revealed statistics on the number of ads that had been nixed. A total of 1.7 billion ads were taken down by Google for various violations. This was more than double the 780 million ads that had been removed in 2015.\n\nBetter detectors\n\nThe Mountain View, California-based tech titan has attributed the jump in ads removed to the technological improvements with regards to tools used to identify offending advertisements and advertiser behavior. In mid-2016 Google had enacted a policy that prohibited payday loan ads as it claimed they were predatory. This resulted in about five million ads of such nature disabled in the second half of 2016.\n\n“In the past year, what’s really changed is that we’ve expanded our policies so we can better protect consumers against issues like misleading ads and predatory offers,” Google’s director of product management, Scott Spencer, told Wired.\n\nIn Wednesday’s trading, Alphabet Inc rose by 1.05% to close the day at $858.45.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.', 'DTE Energy Company (NYSE:DTE) last session’s volume of 0.89 million shares was lower than its average volume of 0.93 million shares.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is teaming up with the Indian government to make a toilet locator app that will help users to find public bathrooms in order to battle the countrywide issue of open urination.\n\nReports said that U.S. Internet giant’s new washroom locator app, has been launched on Thursday in the states of Delhi and Madhya Pradesh, this helps people find access to clean public toilets. This app will also have an extensive range of features such as hygiene ratings, the style of toilet and even will mention if it requires a fee to use or free.\n\nMeanwhile the app will help users to type words such as “toilet” or “lavatory” or Hindi words like “swachh” and “shulabh” meaning clean to access the closest washrooms in the area.\n\n“When you search for ‘public toilet’ on Google Maps in an area where the service is available, you’ll see a list of restrooms near you, including the respective address and opening hours,” Sanket Gupta, product manager Google Maps India, said at a launch event in Delhi.\n\n“For instance, if you’re travelling on the national highway 8 in Gurugram, locating a public toilet can be challenging and most often the only option is going to nearby restaurants and cafes. Having this information handy can make things much easier.”\n\nIt has been one of the most highlighted issue in India to get safe and healthy sanitation. According to lots of official surveys close to almost 70 percent of Indian households have no access to toilets. That’s why, people are required to excrete in open spaces. The latest toilet locator from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) can lay a key role in such situations.', 'Published By: Ken Bock on December 23, 2016 07:30 am EST\n\nAlphabet Incorporation (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has partnered up with Indian government to create a toilet locator Android application. The application will help users to locate public washrooms easily so that the problem of open urinations and defecation can be taken care of. The government has built 11 million toilets around the country in the last two years, but the problem still seems to exist. Ironically, users don’t have access to toilets but do own smartphones in India.\n\nOn 22 December, the search engine giant announced, “Google is adding the location, address, and opening hours of over four thousand communal and public restrooms to Maps, aiming to provide easy access to information to people in India and help improve sanitation.” The toilet locator application is already available in Madhya Pradesh and Delhi, which enable users to find clean restrooms near them.\n\nThe application was launched on Thursday, which not only shows the location of a toilet but how people have rated it in terms of cleanliness. Thus, hygiene conscious can guess beforehand if a particular washroom is worth using or not. Users can simply type in the word ‘toilet’ and even words in Hindi such as ‘shulabh’ and the receive the information they are on the lookout for.\n\nGoogle toilet locator may come in handy on road trips when users are on the highway, or when they are not aware of where the closest restroom is. This application at first seems odd, but it makes complete sense as sanitation has been a major problem in India with almost 70% of households with no access to restrooms. This has led to the population to use open spaces instead which has caused diseases and even deaths. However, there is a very minor chance that households that do not have restrooms will have access to the Internet.\n\nEven tough, the tech company’s efforts might not make a huge difference to the sanitation issue of India, it will surely give users the option to locate toilet in emergencies if they wish to. Google Maps has nearby locations for toilets, regardless of whether users type in Hindi or English, the typed in information will be provided.', 'Published By: Patrick Arruda on January 13, 2017 10:18 am EST\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube has launched a new feature called ""Super Chat"" which has given creators another way to make money and even fans to interact with YouTubers easily. The feature’s timing is perfect as the company announced its plan to stop monetization of videos known as “Fan Funding.” Thus, now creators have been given another way to earn money from their content.\n\nSuper Chat will allow viewers to pin a comment on live broadcasts; a dollar bill symbol will also be seen in the chat window. Users will be able to choose through a slider to select how many dollars would they like to send to the particular YouTuber they enjoy.\n\nThe more the user will pay, the more comments will get pinned. Once the payment is made, the comment will be highlighted in another color so that live streamers can flag the paid comment. In case that particular comment is pushed off the stream, creators will still be able to click through paid comments thanks to the colorful pins which will appear at the top of the window screen.\n\nSuper Chat is simply a replacement for Fan Funding which will keep creators interested in the platform. The product manager of the company, Barbara Macdonald, said that this is one way fans will be able to reach their favorite creators on the platform and vice versa. Fan Funding was launched back in 2014, through which viewers were able to make payments by choice to creators they enjoyed. Now FF will accept sign ups but will keep on working for channels that have it till the February 28, which is when it will be discontinued.\n\nThe new tool will be available in 20 countries to creators, while viewers in 40 countries will be allowed to buy Super Chat messages. Fan Funding is being discontinued because it was not used on a large scale in the first place. Hopefully Super Chat might not give the same result. The tool is for users above 18 years, who own credit cards, but kids might be able to use it if they use their parents’ credit cards. YouTube can be given feedback for two and a half weeks of the launch of Super Chat.', 'Visa Inc.

We’ve already given you a heads up about the device’s lens flare flaw in a previous issue of Pixel’s camera, but now, numerous users have reported some peculiar problems with its camera app.\n\nA number of complaints have surfaced on Google’s product forum about the bizarre issue with Pixel’s camera app. Reports source the camera app to lock up while showing purple and pink lines all across the screen. The original thread was posted on the forum in late October, and since then, numerous such reports have flooded online forums.\n\nInitially it seemed that only the pre-installed camera app was suffering from the purple & pink lines. But now, some users have reported the same issue with third-party apps that uses camera. Reports indicated the fact that the issue was most likely caused by low connectivity of cellular service and that only international models of the Pixel family were affected.\n\nThe company and its representatives on the forum quickly responded to the issue, and provided users with some hands-on troubleshooting tricks to counter the camera issue; however, the problem still persists. A number of users have also reported that replacement devices sporting sub-par cellular connectivity faced the same problem.\n\nTo date, it is still unclear as to what is causing this bizarre issue, and how can poor connections be the reason behind it? What can be done to tackle it? And when is the fix for the camera app flaw coming? However, Google’s first and foremost responsibility has always been to cater the needs of its customers. The Country Caller believes that the search giant will soon come up with a solution. For now, the temporary fix for the issue is to put your phone into airplane mode while using the camera app.', ""Over the past few weeks, a certain audio distortion issue plaguing many Pixel phones has been gaining a lot of traction. The issue was originally brought into the limelight by Mark Buckman, who managed to get a refund on his Pixel device after posting about the issue on Google's Product Forums.\n\nWhile that was a one-off event, Google has now officially acknowledged the existence of the issue and is offering replacement handsets for people with affected devices. Since Google is offering replacements rather than rolling out a software update to fix the issue, it’s clear that the problem is hardware related.\n\nPhoneArena also revealed that Google has stopped issuing refunds on the units like the one given to Mark Buckman. Instead, the company is asking users to opt for warranty replacements. Google has been very proactive regarding the audio distortion issues on its product forums. There have been numerous posts on the forum and the Google Pixel community manager Orrin even notified that the tech giant has been looking into the matter.\n\nOne aspect of this matter is irking a lot of users; Google isn't notifying users of the builds which have been affected by this issue. If Google would do this, users would be able to check if their current phone is faulty and would be able to check before purchasing a faulty build.\n\nEven though the Google Pixel has managed to garner amazing reviews from across the board, the phone has come under fire a few times since its launch. Just last month, numerous users reported premature shutdowns on the device, while complaints about lens flare were also rampant in the same month."", 'Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is the world’s largest technology company, and it once was one of the best growth stocks on the market. It has shifted gears, though, and now Apple stock is one of the more promising dividend growth plays on the market.\n\nAAPL paid its first dividend — at least since 1995 — on Aug. 16, 2012. It paid investors 38.9 cents per share on a split-adjusted basis.\n\nThe payout has been hiked four times since, and currently sits at 57 cents per share. That’s a compound annual growth rate of 10%, with 2017’s dividend increase expected to be similar. After all, AAPL stock only has a payout ratio of 27% of its trailing earnings and a 1.6% yield.\n\nWhen you look at shareholder yield — dividends plus buybacks — Apple’s record is even more impressive. The company spent $12.2 billion on dividends and a whopping $29.2 billion on share repurchases in 2016. That works out to a shareholder yield of 5.6%.\n\nAAPL is returning capital at a blistering pace.\n\nHowever, while most shareholders are ecstatic with the dividend on Apple stock, allow me to present an alternate argument:\n\nApple should cut its payout … and maybe even eliminate it altogether.\n\nApple, Meet Alphabet\n\nLet’s take a minute to compare Apple to one of its peers, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ).\n\nAlphabet’s dividend policy is pretty clear. It said in its 2016 10-K filing, “We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common or capital stock. We intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.”\n\nAlphabet can easily afford a dividend, too. It made $19.5 billion in 2016, or $28.32 per share.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is simple. Alphabet is aggressively investing in the kinds of projects that can really boost its top line. It has been working on a self-driving car since 2009. It invested more than $6 billion on Google Fiber. Alphabet also teamed up with Fidelity to invest $1 billion in SpaceX.\n\nIn total, Alphabet spent $13.9 billion on research and development in 2016, as well as $10.2 billion on capital expenditures.\n\nApple is still investing in the future, but not as aggressively as Alphabet. AAPL spent $10 billion on research and development and $13.5 billion on capital expenditures in 2016, despite making a net profit of $45.7 billion.\n\nIn other words, Alphabet reinvested $24.1 billion back into its business in 2016 while earning $19.5 billion. Apple reinvested $23.5 billion while earning $45.7 billion. AAPL barely reinvested half of its earnings back into its business.\n\nAAPL Needs to Make Some Acquisitions\n\nApple does have some exciting plans. One of the tech world’s worst-kept secrets is Apple’s plans to somehow be a part of the car of the future. It has also been working in the virtual reality space, and many expect big improvements to Apple TV. These investments are great. But I don’t think they’ll be enough to usher in a new era of growth.\n\nIt’s time for Apple to go shopping.\n\nNext Page', '', 'Published By: Ken Bock on December 8, 2016 09:27 am EST\n\nAlphabet Incorporation has revealed a website, World of Thanks, where Project Fi members have been invited to create snow globes and greeting cards.

The investment firm is described in a press release as focusing on companies tackling long-term trends, and Verily definitely fits the bill with its efforts to address issues like deteriorating vision and Parkinson’s disease.\n\nVerily is also doing work on disease detection, including via efforts to bring to life a real-world Tricorder, mimicking the fictional performance of the device with the same name depicted in the Star Trek franchise. Stat News reported last year that Verily’s efforts on this front weren’t turning out quite as hoped, however.\n\nStill, Verily’s portfolio also includes a project to establish a healthy baseline for human beings, down to the genetic level, as well as develop a health tracking wristband designed for actually monitoring patients as a prescription device, and efforts to help develop ever more advanced surgical assistance robots. It’s also looking to build better bugs (actual insects) in an effort to combat disease transmission.\n\nThe investment will result in Temasek getting a minority stake in Verily, and Temasek will also get to nominate one of its own as a board member for the Alphabet-owned company. Verily CEO Andrew Conrad also noted in the press release announcing the investment that Temasek will help the company strategically as it looks to build out its business in Asia and beyond the U.S.\n\nVerily is moving towards more commercialization of its work through this new investment, and it’s not the only Alphabet subsidiary to begin to pursue commercial applications of its work with more apparent urgency.

Its price to sales ratio ended at 6.53. GOOGL attains analyst recommendation of 1.80 with week’s performance of 1.73%.', 'Are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stocks worth adding to your portfolio? In short the answer is likely yes, since each of these companies is among the leaders in its respective industry. However, each stock is rather expensive and it is not guaranteed that all of them will outperform the market, at least in the short term. There are many ways to analyze a stock, one of which is to see how smart investors are trading it, which is what we do at Insider Monkey. The smartest investors in recent quarters seem to be, well, robots or quant hedge funds.\n\nWe track over 700 hedge funds and other institutional investors and analyze every quarter the general sentiment among them towards thousands of stock. One particularly interesting group of investors that we follow are quantitative hedge funds, many of which are some of the largest and best-performing funds on Wall Street. We calculated the returns of some of these funds using data from their publicly available 13F filings, and determined that most quant funds managed to outperform the market even though in some instances their picks were less risky than the broader market. For example, the top five stock picks of Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies posted an equal-weighted average gain of 1.17% per month between 2008 and 2012, outperforming the S&P 500 which inched up by 0.29% per month during the same period. When we adjusted returns for known factor returns like size, value, and momentum RenTech’s alpha turned out to be 103 basis points per month. This means this quant hedge fund’s top picks were able to beat the market by almost a percentage point a month by investing in a portfolio of less risky stocks.\n\nHaving said that, we have lined up six quantitative hedge funds: Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management, David E. Shaw’s D. E. Shaw & Co., Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies, Peter Muller’s PDT Partners, and Neil Chriss’ Hutchin Hill Capital. In a previous article, we have discussed most of these funds, as well as their top stock picks. In this piece, we’ll take a look how these funds traded the aforementioned four stocks: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Most of the quant funds in question own shares of each of these stocks, but based on the size of each position and the changes it underwent during the third quarter, we will try to determine two stocks that could potentially represent the best investments.\n\nLet’s start with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), in which all five of the six quants held shares heading into the fourth quarter, while one fund closed its position between July and September. The largest positions are held by D. E. Shaw & Co. and AQR Capital Management, which disclosed ownership of 6.68 million shares and 6.44 million shares, respectively. Moreover, both funds held Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as their second-largest holding and both increased their exposure to the stock over the quarter, but, while AQR Capital increased it by just 14%, D. E. Shaw boosted it by 178%. Other quants that increased their stakes included PDT Partners, which added 17,200 shares to its stake, taking it to 89,500 shares, while Hutchin Hill Capital added 24,900 shares and held 25,000 shares at the end of September. However, at the same time, we have two funds that limited their exposure to the stock. As stated earlier, one investor that sold all of its shares in Apple is Renaissance Technologies, which had previously owned nearly 1.10 million shares (at the end of June). In addition, Two Sigma Advisors cut its stake by 81% and held just 48,531 shares heading into the fourth quarter. So, from what it looks like the quants that we are discussing in this article are overall bullish on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is also supported by our more general data across all hedge funds tracked by us, with the number of investors long Apple jumping to 145 from 116 during the third quarter.', ""Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) recently reported earnings for the fourth quarter. This Seeking Alpha breaking news item from January 26, 2017, summarizes the report with a couple statistics: the earnings per share of $9.36 missed consensus expectations by $0.26. The top line, at a little over $26 billion, beat by $830 million. The market traded the stock down at the time of this news item by 1.4%.\n\nI get the trading aspect here, but I am a shareholder of Alphabet, and this doesn't impact my long-term thesis at all. Alphabet has a few important things going for it that will create value in the years ahead, making me happy to be patient and not at all discouraged by a negative reaction to Q4 (even if that negative reaction continues on in the trading sessions ahead).\n\nAlphabet: It Knows Search Technologies And How To Monetize Them\n\nSearch engines are indispensable when using the Internet as a tool of research for any topic no matter the motivation (i.e., practical versus leisure), and Alphabet's Google search engine is the blue chip in the space. The company's algorithms are sophisticated and will increase in utility over time.\n\nAlphabet has been very successful at making money from search with advertising. The Q4 press release states that the Google operating segment brought in $7.9 billion in income over the three-month period. For all of 2016, the company as a whole made $23.7 billion in operating income compared to $19.4 billion in 2015. Google search drives this company.\n\nWhy will Google grow? Mobile search will continue to be important in the coming years. It will expand as the culture remains on a post-desktop-PC course.\n\nIn addition, advertisers love how Google and its data help them make better choices in terms of targeting consumers. It's all about targeting, and search engines can deliver on this - especially Google's prime asset.\n\nAlso of note: advertisers need to reach web users. If the culture continues to use the web, then it does so at the expense of other media - this is well-known. An advertiser that wants to reach college kids may not want to advertise in a magazine or a late-night talk show. Instead, it will want to buy ads before a segment of video or on the home screen of big Internet portals. Other media are still important, but all of us are aware of how vital online properties have become in the lives of consumers.\n\nThis core search-engine asset will allow the company to engage other investment opportunities, as I will discuss in the next two sections.\n\nAlpha(other)bet(s)\n\nGoogle is key to the thesis, but Alphabet has a segment it calls Other Bets. This segment captures all the activity of the company's various experiments. For example, Google Fiber is an other bet.\n\nExperimenting with different business models is another reason to own Alphabet. There's something very important to note: in the past, the company seemed to stress (in my opinion) risk taking in this area. Today, the perception is that the company wants to be disciplined about risk. This is exactly what a shareholder wants to hear. The company isn't planning to send people to Pluto or start a subscription service called YouTube Future that shows videos of events that will happen years from now. In my opinion, management wants to stress the practical aspects of experimentation and leave it to the other guy to create the first wormhole.\n\nIn a sense, by buying Alphabet you aren't just buying a great search engine but an overall managerial attitude that will serve investors well - be creative, but be prudent, always with an eye toward keeping the stock going. This attitude also is an asset, intangible though it may be. The memo here is clear: we want to expand, but we don't want to be the place where we throw valuable money at an impractical business-model fantasy. This CNBC article serves as a source for this idea. It mentions the fiber experiment - if one reads between the lines, one might come away with the notion that management realizes the challenged potential with the concept, and is acting properly to not allow the project to take up too much of the company's resources.\n\nFuture Acquisitions\n\nPerhaps even most exciting is Alphabet's potential investment in acquisitions. There are many technologies the company will pursue in the next decade, but when you stop and think about it, probably the biggest thing that management will chase will be purchases relating to YouTube and its attempts at becoming a subscription service.\n\nYouTube is a puzzling asset: it's immensely popular, it is ad-supported, but the company wants people to directly pay for it - hence the YouTube Red service. The latter is an experiment management must continue until it gets it correct. Advertising is a useful, justifiable way of monetizing the video site, but a subscriber-based approach is more attractive - having a mix of the two models will serve Alphabet well. However, the company will need to improve this segment via acquisition.\n\nThe market may in fact be signaling this. This article over at Recode wonders about the possibility of a tech business like Alphabet buying Sony Pictures (there is a rumor that Sony may want to sell this division).\n\nAt some point, Alphabet will make a big acquisition in this area. It will help the company sell subscriptions. Revenue from subscriptions is what a company that is based on giving out much of its stuff for free wants to achieve. When a merger for a concern such as Sony Pictures occurs, it will be good for the stock. Consolidation in the media space, the marriage between tech-data and intellectual properties in this new streaming age, is a theme that a lot of pundits promote. I agree with the theme, and I know I want to continue to own Alphabet ahead of the future acquisitions it makes for its search ambitions and for its YouTube services.\n\nBig Risk: Watch Out For The Rest Of The FANG\n\nThe FANG stocks (thank you, Jim Cramer) are the risk here. FANG is Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Alphabet (i.e., G for Google).\n\nWhy do they constitute a risk? Simple: everything Alphabet wants to do they want to do. They are, in fact, doing it already. Think Facebook and Amazon don't fool around with search algorithms, or that Netflix isn't interested in the kind of data Alphabet is interested in? All of it is fair game. Who is to say Netflix won't fund its own Internet search engine once (or if) it turns extremely profitable from its own subscription service?\n\nAll of these tech companies want to do other things, explore their own other bets (maybe Netflix will one day have a show called Other Bets, about a strange tech company that funds all kinds of weird supernatural experiments; could be a sequel series to Stranger Things). They aren't sitting still, and that would be a concern to an investor.\n\nAlpha(Long-Term)bet\n\nLet's look at the following chart for Alphabet.\n\nI can't predict the future with the above graphic. That isn't my intent. The past oftentimes may not mean a whole lot.\n\nNevertheless, investors always look at the past. It's another data point, for better or for worse. To me, the trend at least tells me that the stock has been heading in the right direction and that the market seems to have confidence, to one debatable degree or another, in the company and its management team.\n\nAs I check other Seeking Alpha articles, I note the bullish sentiment. This article by D.M. Martins Research goes into helpful detail on the other-bets category - read it just for that. But I wanted to mention that the author mentions the possibility of a $1,000 stock price at some future trading date. Stone Fox Capital likewise threw that number into the discussion.\n\nSometimes a lot of agreement on a stock can be a troubling thing (if you want to see some of the cons to the latest earnings report, read this article), but I honestly believe that Alphabet shares will eventually get to this price. The combination of search, speculative investments and an eventual acquisition strategy will support the stock on such a run-up to that level.\n\nAlphabet, in my opinion, is a buy for the long-term portfolio in need of some exposure to the technology sector. As always, perform your own due diligence."", 'Investors may be focused on tracking the latest sentiment on shares of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL). In addition to monitoring Wall Street analyst views, investors may also be examining crowd sourced data provided by individuals who keep a close watch on the company. Using open records and scorecards, Bets Systems Research has compiled crowd sourced ratings. The goal is to give a higher level of transparency for the ratings process, and to gain a wider sense of sentiment on shares. Shares of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) presently have an average rating of 4. This rating uses a numerical scale from 1 to 5. A 5 rating would represent a Strong Buy recommendation. A 1 rating would signify a Strong Sell. Taking a look at the 26 total compiled ratings, 21 have pinned the stock with a Moderate Buy, and 3 have pegged the stock as a Strong Buy.\n\nAn important aspect of stock evaluation involves closely tracking company earnings information. Investors and analysts are constantly watching to see if a company will meet or beat earnings projections. Alphabet Inc is scheduled to next publish earnings results on or around 2017-04-20. Sell-side equity analysts are looking for the company to report quarterly EPS of $7.2 for the current quarter. The company most recently posted quarterly EPS of $7.56 for the period ending on 2016-12-31.\n\nEquity analysts will routinely give stock price target projections. Many investors are highly interested in where the analysts see the stock going in the future. Presently, analysts polled by Zacks Research have set a consensus target price of $964.62 on the stock. The targets from these analysts range between 700 and $1100. These same covering analysts have also given share ratings. The current average broker rating for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is 1.34. This ABR is presently using data from 29 covering analysts.', ""With most companies having already reported their December quarter results, Cantor Fitzgerald looks at the performance of the group relative to prior periods and finds it generally in line, with the majority (73% in this case) beating consensus top line estimates. 2017 guidance looks promising, suggesting that growth expectations for the group remain healthy. Notable news last week include FB opening mid-roll ads to more Live broadcasters; Google announcing MRC audits of third party viewability integrations, and Amazon lowering minimum shipping threshold on the back of WalMart's recent move. The firm's top picks are Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and EXPE. Among smaller cap names, the firm favors SFLY, ACXM and YELP.\n\nCII underperformed the market last week. The Cantor Internet Index underperformed the broader market last week, down 0.1% vs. the S&P 500 gain of +0.7%, resulting in a YTD rise of +5.5% vs. the S&P 500 +5.6%. The group is trading at 14.1x EV/NTM EBITDA, within its five-year historical range of 8-16x. Solid 4Q16 earnings results consistent with 3Q16 performance. In Cantor's post-mortem analysis of 4Q16 results, the firm notes that 73% of covered companies beat consensus revenue estimates and 77% beat consensus EBITDA estimates, virtually in line with 3Q16 performance of 67%/81%. For those companies that guide, the outlook was largely in line with/above expectations.\n\nFacebook opens mid-roll ads to more Live broadcasters, according to MarketingLand. Facebook extended the ability for certain Pages/Profiles to insert mid-roll video ads within their Facebook Live broadcasts, and has started testing these mid-rolls, or ad breaks, within non-live videos, according to the article. The company began testing these mid-roll units since August of last year, so this potentially lucrative new video format is ramping up. Cantor Fitzgerald views this as an incremental positive for Facebook’s video bid density, and therefore CPMs.\n\nAlphabet’s Google announced that the MRC would audit 3rd party viewability reporting on YouTube. YouTube has been integrated with Moat, Integral Ad Science, and DoubleVerify for third party viewability reporting since 2015, and this latest announcement means that each integration will undergo a stringent, independent audit for MRC accreditation and each adheres to MRC and IAB standards, according to Google’s Agency Blog. Cantor Fitzgerald believes this is a positive step forward toward more transparency and trust in the digital advertising eco-system.\n\nAmazon lowers minimum shipping threshold. Last week, Amazon lowered the threshold to get free shipping to $35 from $49 - back to where it used to be prior to last year's hike. Cantor Fitzgerald views this as a defensive-offensive move, largely in response to Wal-Mart, which last month started offering free 2-day shipping on online orders above $35 and scrapped its Shipping Pass program ($49/yr for unlimited free shipping). While Amazon dominates online commerce, the firm believes it's taking Wal-Mart's move seriously. It notes that last year, Wal-Mart made a bold move to bolster its ecommerce offering by acquiring Jet.com for $2B in cash and by and installing its co-founder Marc Lore (an ex-Amazon exec/co-founder of Diapers.com) as the head of its ecommerce operations.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this article are subjects of research reports issued recently by investment firms.

(NYSE:T) stock could be both an exciting and a boring investment opportunity.\n\nThe exciting part for T stock is its products, which include the latest phones to hit the market. These phones are made by the major players in the industry, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nThe boring part for T stock would be the investment as a whole. AT&T pays a dividend on a quarterly basis, with a current value of $0.49 per share. The shares are trading at $42.72, which is offering a yield of 4.59%.\n\nThe dividend exists because T stock operates in the telecommunications sector. The industry is known for having large up-front costs to join, but minimal costs outside of infrastructure maintenance fees. This can be seen in the earnings payout ratio of 68%. So while T stock may be considered a boring investment, there’s nothing boring about receiving a dividend.\n\nWith the business being low-cost following its launch, shareholders have been able to receive an increasing dividend payment. The dividend increased every year since 1985–that’s 31 years!\n\nFor AT&T to continue its streak of paying an increasing dividend, revenue needs to increase as well. And on that front, so far so good, as revenue has increased 15% over the past five years. This supports the idea of more dividend hikes in the future.\n\nAs an investor, one likely concern is the company outlook when it comes to its competition. However, AT&T is part of an oligopoly, meaning only a few companies operate in its market, with a larger share held by each of those few companies. Again, this is due to the large startup cost that is required to start a business in this segment.\n\nAnother reason why T stock would be considered boring is because there is not a lot of volatility of the price movement. This is a positive because when the market does have a huge movement downwards, the invested capital should be preserved. This price movement is measured by the beta of the stock, which is 0.39 for AT&T. What this number means is that if the market fell by one percent, then T stock should fall by 0.39% on average.\n\nMore information regarding why investors should take notice of AT&T can be found in the the price-to-earnings ratio. T stock’s current ratio is 18.15 times, trading at a 30% discount when compared to the broad-based S&P 500.\n\nFinal Thoughts On T Stock\n\nAT&T is one of the largest telecom companies in the U.S., with over 133.3 million customers. And with a large customer base comes no need to worry about continued cash flow.\n\nLong-term investors willing to be patient may want to consider owning this stock. AT&T has proven friendly to shareholders over its long history of providing rewards.', 'Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s stock has been of interest for both individual investors and Wall Street analysts recently. Let’s look at the crowd and equity research sentiment so that we can get a solid idea as to where the shares might be headed. Should we buy, sell or hold?\n\nZacks collects broker services based on the information provided by 29 analysts. These services are then Zacks into their five-point ratings scale, allowing for easier interpretation for private investors. This differs from the Crowd Ratings scale, because Zacks numbers work in the opposite direction. Zacks says one is a “Strong Buy” and five is a Strong Sell. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s ABR (average broker rating) is 1.34.\n\nStreet analysts anticipate that the social media giant would post quarterly share earnings of $7.2. The actual earnings that the firm reported last quarter was $7.56. Interested parties will be awaiting the moment when Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will reveal their actual results on 2017-04-20.\n\nNow let’s look at the Closing Bell. Individual investors can rate a stock according a sliding scale where “one” is a Strong Sell and “five” is a Strong Buy. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s crowd consensus rating is 4. This rating is derived from the 26 ratings provided by individuals investors.\n\nBrokerage Firm Analysts View\n\nPrivate investors also pay attention to how Wall Street researchers react to stocks. Zacks Research, a well-respected research firm with over 30 years of experience, compiles all of this brokerage data and then produce rankings and predictive data. Wall Street sell-side analysts anticipated that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s shares will reach a high of $700-$1100. The consensus target is at $964.62.', 'NEW YORK Dec 11 Top executives from Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Facebook Inc are among a small group of tech leaders invited to a summit to be held on Wednesday by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, Recode reported, citing sources.\n\nExecutives from Microsoft Corp, Intel Corp and Oracle Corp will also be among ""a very heady group of less than a dozen, comprising most of the key players in the sector"" to attend the summit, Recode said. (on.recode.net/2gqbVbq)\n\n""I plan to tell the president-elect that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can,"" Oracle Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz told Reuters in an emailed statement.\n\n""If he can reform the tax code, reduce regulation, and negotiate better trade deals, the U.S. technology community will be stronger and more competitive than ever.""\n\nAmazon.com Inc CEO and founder Jeff Bezos was also invited and is likely to attend, Recode said citing ""numerous"" sources with knowledge of the situation.\n\nFacebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAn Intel spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe gathering will take place Wednesday at Trump Tower in New York City, Recode said. (Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York; Editing by Alan Crosby)', 'Reportedly, technology leaders are set to meet President-elect Donald Trump in a summit to be held on Wednesday (Dec 14, 2016).\n\nPer The Wall Street Journal, the small selective group is expected to include top-executives from Apple Inc. ( AAPL ), Alphabet Inc ( GOOGL ), Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ), Cisco Systems, Inc. ( CSCO ), Facebook Inc ( FB ), International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM ), Intel Corporation ( INTC ), Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) and Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ), along with Tesla Motors Inc’s ( TSLA ) Elon Musk.\n\nThe event is significant for the technology and allied sector as it grapples with growing uncertainty over Trump administration’s economic policies and its impact on the industry.\n\nNotably, top-most technology leaders of the Silicon Valley had openly protested against Trump’s rhetoric during election campaign. The President-elect had threatened to force technology companies like Apple to bring their overseas manufacturing operations back to the U.S.\n\nMoreover, Trump’s views over antitrust enforcement, trade protectionism, immigration policy (particularly issuance of H1B visas used to hire skilled foreigners) and net-neutrality (Donald Trump is known as a criticizer of this policy) are some of the major headwinds for the U.S. technology companies like IBM, Alphabet and Netflix, Inc. ( NFLX ).\n\nAnother concern is Trump’s determination to cut clean energy spending.\n\nMost of the big technology companies have been moving toward clean energy with the help of government tax breaks. Any spending cut will certainly be a dampener on these plans.\n\nTechnology Sector and Donald Trump – Common Ground\n\nDespite the verbal volleys and pre-election enmity, it is now quite clear that none of them — Donald Trump nor the Silicon Valley bigwigs — can ignore each other. For the sake of smooth running of their businesses as well as the U.S. economy, a “common ground” is necessary as observed by the Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Gallant.\n\nCorporate tax reform that has been blatantly advocated by the President-elect since early days of his campaign is an issue that can bring technology leaders and Donald Trump to a truce.\n\nPer data from Moody’s Investors Service Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle together made up almost 30% ($504 billion) of the $1.7 trillion in cash and cash equivalents held by U.S. non-financial companies in 2015. According to figures from the WSJ: “Apple alone holds about 91% of its $237.6 billion in cash offshore.”\n\nNotably, the U.S. government currently levies a 35% tax rate on repatriated cash, which Trump has promised to lower to 15%. An ideal restructuring of tax rates will enable companies like Apple to bring back a major part of their offshore cash to the U.S.\n\nWill Technology Stocks Rebound?\n\nSince Donald Trump’s selection (Nov 9), we note that the Zacks Computer & Technology industry has returned a modest 2.12% as compared with S&P 500 Composite’s gain of 4.22%. However, we believe that the upcoming meet will ease out some of those concerns that will eventually help the stocks to rebound.\n\nWe use our VGM Score to track technology stocks that shows characteristics to outperform the broader market. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.\n\nHere we pick four stocks that have a favorable combination of VGM score of ‘A’ and Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nMoreover, these stocks have returns of more than 15% since the election of Donald Trump.\n\nNext Page', 'Bezos, Musk and Trump have sparred with one another before\n\nMain topic of meeting said to be job creation in the U.S.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos and Tesla Motors Inc. CEO Elon Musk will be among those attending President-elect Donald Trump’s gathering of technology industry leaders Wednesday in New York, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nAn invitation to the meeting went out last week from members of Trump’s transition team, including venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Oracle Corp. co-CEO Safra Catz, Cisco Systems Inc.’s Chuck Robbins and Facebook Inc. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg plan to attend. Alphabet Inc.’s Larry Page and Eric Schmidt will be there too, as will Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook, according to people familiar with the matter. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty -- who is on Trump’s advisory panel of business leaders -- will also attend, said a person familiar with her plans.\n\nThe main topic of the meeting scheduled for 2 p.m. Wednesday is likely to be job creation, one of the people said.\n\nWhile support for Trump was thin among technology executives during the presidential campaign, Bezos and Trump clashed the most publicly. The Amazon founder mockingly tweeted that he would send the Republican candidate to space on one of his rockets, and Trump accused Bezos of purchasing the Washington Post to gain political influence in the nation’s capital to help his growing e-commerce empire.\n\nBezos is doing the responsible thing for Amazon shareholders in attending the summit even though it promises to be a ""groveling session made for reality TV,"" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc.\n\n""Bezos has to participate because he and his company were singled out,"" Pachter said. ""He has to be honorable and protect his shareholders.""\n\nTechnology leaders in Silicon Valley and beyond had openly signaled an uneasiness with Trump, with most favoring Hillary Clinton -- contributions to her campaign were 114 times the level they were for Trump, according to statistics compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Over the summer, a group of about 140 industry figures sent an open letter decrying Trump’s views on immigration, internet security and government investment, which they said would stifle innovation and growth.\n\nCommon Ground\n\nOther significant issues for the industry that could be discussed are possible repatriation of overseas earnings and corporate tax reform, said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.\n\nCisco’s Robbins said those issues are among “pretty important potential changes we could see in the corporate arena” under Trump.\n\nSpeaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in response to a question about how a change in repatriation rules or tax reform would affect Cisco’s strategy, Robbins said a shift on bringing back foreign earnings is “not being positioned as a tax holiday. It would be a permanent solution which we would be very happy with.”\n\nA lower tax rate is “where I think the jobs get created,” he said. “So we’re optimistic and we’ll see how it plays out.”\n\nAtkinson said the meeting may address China, where several U.S. tech companies have struggled to find a foothold. Recode reported earlier that Sandberg would be there and that Bezos was likely to attend. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the main topic of the meeting.\n\nThe gathering will also be a chance for tech’s leaders to find some common ground with the new administration.\n\nBezos and Trump have had a long-running spat, played out largely via Twitter, beginning last December after the candidate attacked the Washington Post for publishing unflattering reports about him.\n\n“The Washington Post, which loses a fortune, is owned by Jeff Bezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, Amazon,” Trump said.\n\nIn June, Trump’s campaign revoked the Post’s press credentials, accusing the newspaper of being a front for Amazon’s political agenda. The newspaper later was the first to report on the “Access Hollywood” footage from 2005 of Trump making lewd comments about women.\n\nFollowing Trump’s victory in November, Bezos sought to strike a conciliatory tone, tweeting, ""I for one give him my most open mind.""\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nMusk’s attendance brings a triangle of tension to the meeting. He and Bezos are both tech moguls who made their fortunes on the internet and then plowed them into space exploration. The two have sparred publicly via Twitter about the accomplishments of their space exploration companies: Musk owns Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and Bezos owns Blue Origin LLC, which are both trying to advance space exploration with rockets that can be reused like airplanes.\n\nBezos’s first-ever tweet celebrated Blue Origin sending a rocket to the edge of space and landing it back on Earth. Musk initially offered kudos, then in a subsequent message said: ""It is however, important to clear up the difference between ‘space’ and ‘orbit’"" to highlight the current technology gap between the two ventures.', 'For most of Silicon Valley, Donald Trump\'s U.S. presidential election win was jarring.
