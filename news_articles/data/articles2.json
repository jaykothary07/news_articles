Steve Jobs had just rejoined the company he had founded two decades earlier: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Two 20-somethings named Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded a company they thought could help organize the world's information: Google -- which later became Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nThe former was worth just over $5 billion, while the latter was worth virtually nothing. Fast-forward not even two decades and they are arguably the two most powerful companies the world has ever known, with a combined market capitalization of almost $1.2 trillion!\n\nBut which stock is a better buy at today's prices?\n\nThere's no definitive way to answer that question. However, there are many different ways to approach it that will help you get more comfortable picking one of these two titans. Here are the three aspects that I consider to be most important.\n\nFinancial fortitude\n\nToo much cash is a good problem to have. Over the long run, owning a company that has this kind of cash \"problem\" is very desirable. That's because when difficult times hit -- and they will hit -- companies that have cash have options. They can outspend their more cash-strapped rivals, buy back their own stock, or even make acquisitions.\n\nCompanies that are debt-heavy, on the other hand, find themselves in the exact opposite boat: struggling just to make ends meet, exploring options to be bought out, or even succumbing to bankruptcy.\n\nHere's how Apple and Alphabet stack up in terms of financial fortitude.\n\nCompany Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Alphabet $78 billion $2 billion $19 billion $24 billion Apple $238 billion $75 billion $46 billion $53 billion\n\nIt would be very difficult to find two companies that have stronger balance sheets. While it's clear that Apple's numbers are greater than Alphabet's -- even after accounting for the fact that Apple is valued 11% higher than Alphabet -- the point of this lens is to see if one company has substantially more flexibility due to its cash than another.\n\nOnce we get to the point that these two companies are at, it's essentially a wash.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nSustainable competitive advantages\n\nOf these three factors, this is perhaps the most important. Commonly referred to as a \"moat\" in investing circles, a company's sustainable competitive advantages are often the special sauce that separate it from competitors.\n\nSome might be surprised to hear that I think Alphabet has a much stronger moat than Apple. Apple's moat is two-fold. First, it has a very powerful brand -- even more so abroad. That allows the company to charge more for its products than competitors. Second, the company has been building out an ecosystem that keeps users hooked in the system. For example, if your iPhone is synced with your Mac, your iPad, and your Apple TV, you'd be loath to switch to a different phone.\n\nBut the major weakness here is that the company has traditionally relied on coming up with \"the next big thing\" to drive sales. The iPhone was arguably one of the biggest consumer hits ever, but it has been a long time since Apple has released a product that even comes close to touching the iPhone's popularity, and the competition is always clawing for market share.\n\nAlphabet, on the other hand, has the type of moat that famed investor Charlie Munger once said might be the widest he'd ever seen. That's because Google has a dominant search market share globally. But search is just one of seven Alphabet products that have over 1 billion users. The others are: Android, Chrome, Maps, Google Play Store, Gmail, and YouTube.\n\nThink about Alphabet's moat like this: With each additional user that gets in Google's ecosystem, the company collects copious amounts of data, all of which can be used to offer advertising that's more targeted than anywhere in the world. In the end, those ads are what pays the bills at Alphabet, and with the exception of Facebook, there isn't a company (or government) on earth that can come close to Alphabet's data trove.\n\nWinner: Alphabet\n\nValuation\n\nFinally, we have valuation. This isn't an exact science, but here are four metrics I like to check when evaluating stocks.\n\nCompany P/E Ratio P/FCF Ratio PEG Ratio Dividend Alphabet 24 24 1.3 0% Apple 14 12 1.5 2%\n\nWhile Alphabet appears to be slightly cheaper relative to its growth potential (PEG ratio), Apple is a better deal on every other metric. It's tough to find a company as successful as Apple that's trading for quite so cheap. And the fact that you get a 2% dividend -- which is both safe and has room for growth -- is the icing on the cake that makes Apple the winner of this round.\n\nWinner: Apple\n\nFinal call: Draw\n\nBoth companies are solid. Apple is the cheaper stock; Alphabet has a stronger moat. As a tie-breaker, I go where my own skin in the game is: I'd definitely side with Alphabet. The company represents 13% of my family's real-life holdings, while Apple clocks in at just under 4%.", "If I told investors at the beginning of 2016 that Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) would be getting beaten after 49 weeks of the year by 374 out of the 502 companies in the S&P 500, many of you would have thought I was off my rocker. But that’s exactly where GOOGL stock sits with a few weeks to go left in the trading year.\n\nSource: Google\n\nAlphabet shares were up just 1.7% year-to-date through Dec. 8. “Imagine that,” my mother-in-law would say in her best Maritime accent.\n\nHowever, if you’ve never owned GOOGL stock, don’t be put off by its lack of performance in 2016. It’s a must-own stock for any investment portfolio.\n\nHere are three reasons why I feel this way.\n\nGOOGL Stock Key #1: “Other Revenues”\n\nYou might think that Google is nothing more than a glorified advertising company — after all, 89% of the $76.1 billion in annual revenue Alphabet generated through the end of September came from its ad business — but you’d be mistaken.\n\nIn Q3 2016, GOOGL generated $2.4 billion in other revenues, 39% higher year-over-year and 12% sequentially. This represented 10.9% of the Google segment’s overall revenue of $22.3 billion. For the first nine months of the year, Google’s other revenues came to $6.7 billion, 31% higher than a year earlier. There’s nothing insignificant about this kind of revenue. On its own, it would be a decent-sized business.\n\nThe two biggest components of its other revenues: Google Cloud and Google Play.\n\nWhile the advertising revenue generated by Google Play is included in the websites sub-segment of Google, the apps and media content sold in the Google Play store falls under other revenues. With the global mobile app market expected to surpass $100 billion by 2020, Google’s revenues in this area will jump exponentially.\n\nOn the cloud side of the ledger, GOOGL has been playing a weak game of catch-up with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), but the Q3 numbers suggest that’s starting to change for the better.\n\nKeep an eye on this number. As long as other revenues continue to grow as a percentage of Google’s overall revenue, Alphabet’s winning.\n\nGOOGL Stock Key #2: “Other Bets”\n\nThe “Other Bets” — not to be confused with “other revenues” — are the various businesses Alphabet owns outside its legacy Google segment. They include Nest, Verily, Access, X, etc. and represent the company’s constant push for innovation.\n\nThey’re also big-time money losers.\n\nIn the 12 months ended Sept. 30, they collectively lost $3.8 billion. Most of the early stage revenue is generated by Nest (thermostats, CO2 sensors), Access (Google Fiber) and Verily (contact lenses, healthcare analytics).\n\nIn the first nine months of 2016, its Other Bets saw revenues increase 85% year-over-year to $595 million, but still less than 1% of the legacy business’s overall revenue.\n\nInnovation, while at the heart of the Other Bets’ DNA, can’t be carried out in a bubble. Profits do matter. When Alphabet was created, entrepreneurial leaders such as former Nest CEO and co-founder Tony Fadell felt hamstrung by a new financial discipline that asked more of its so-called “moonshots.” He left in June.\n\nWhile that’s temporarily slowed innovation at Nest, ultimately it looks to be the first Other Bets business to actually make money.\n\nNext Page", "Is FB Stock Now A Better Bet Than GOOGL Stock?\n\nSize hasn’t stopped Alphabet from growing in double digits .\n\n. What is the real potential impact of Facebook’s growth on Google ad revenues?\n\nCan Google fend them off, and how can you benefit from this duel?\n\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock price has been nearly flat in the last twelve months despite the company posting average YoY revenue growth of 19.65% in the last three quarters. The double digit growth rate is staggering because Alphabet’s quarterly revenues are already well over $20 billion. What’s even more surprising though, is the meek response from the market, which decided to completely overlook the strong growth numbers. Now with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) doing a stellar job both financially, and in terms of stock performance, comparisons are being drawn again. Can Facebook really dent Alphabet Inc?\n\nA Valuation Problem?\n\nOne of the major factors that resulted in the market’s muted reaction is Alphabet’s current valuation. The stock is already trading above 6 times sales and 28 times earnings, which is a bit on the high side for a technology company of Alphabet’s size and scale. A lot of that double-digit growth seems to have been already priced in and, as a result, the stock kept moving sideways.\n\nThe other factor that is also playing an important role is the growth expectation. The online advertising industry still has plenty of room to grow, but a large portion of that growth will come from developing markets that are comparatively less profitable than developed markets, and also due to the shift from desktop to mobile.\n\nThe impact of that shift can already be seen in the way Alphabet’s aggregate cost per click has declined in the last two years. At the same time, the total number of clicks has increased. The shift to mobile as well as the increasing traffic from new markets are jointly giving more click volume, but lower revenue per click. This trend will continue, it is not something that Alphabet can snap itself out of that easily; and in all likelihood we might see this accelerate in the next few years as mobile usage in developing markets increases. (See Also: FB Stock: Is Facebook Inc (FB) Eating YouTube's Lunch- Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) ?)\n\nMargins Gaining Stability, and No Competitor Breathing Down its Neck\n\nGoogle’s operating margin has been coming down as result of these changes but, thankfully, the numbers are a tad more stable this year. The decline in operating margins was not because Alphabet had to cut down its pricing because of competition, but more because of the shift in market dynamics we discussed above.\n\nDespite the decline, however, Alphabet’s advertising machine remains a cash cow for the company and will remain that way for many more years to come, as there is no clear rival that can give an advertiser more leverage for its ad dollars.\n\nFacebook (NASDAQ:FB) might have overtaken Alphabet in the news traffic referral race, but the company is still many years away from the market leader in terms of revenues. Traffic referral is basically the volume of web visits that go to a website after users have clicked a link. With Google, it’s about clicks on search results, news links and so on; with Facebook, it’s about clicks to advertised or organic linked posts.\n\nThe Facebook threat is certainly there for Alphabet, but there’s plenty of time before the social media giant can mount a full-scale attack on Google revenue streams. Again, with the shift to mobile, Facebook benefits from increased traffic and ad revenues, but it’s far behind in the video space, which YouTube will continue to dominate for the foreseeable future.\n\n“YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView, with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager.” - Sundar Pichai, CEO, Google\n\nAlso Read: Why AAPL Stock Is Better Investment Than GOOGL Stock Going Into 2017: Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc\n\nTable for Two, Please!\n\nThat balance will keep Facebook at bay for now, but there’s also another factor to consider. The online advertising market might be growing at a rapid pace, but has yet to ‘come of age’, as it were. Print advertising may have taken a hit in the last five years, but television still holds the lion’s share of ad revenues globally.\n\nSource: Intelliassist\n\nThat means the growth opportunity isn’t only there for newer players like Facebook; it is very much there for Alphabet as well, as they’ve shown over recent quarters.\n\nTherefore, it stands to reason that even if Facebook is able to show rapid growth - and they’ve already warned of reaching optimal ad loads - over the next few quarters, all Alphabet needs to do is keep their own double digit growth intact for them to fend off Facebook.\n\nIn Summary\n\nPut all these factors together and it’s clear that the runway is long for Alphabet’s Google. Notwithstanding the fact that Other Bets have largely shown disappointing results until now, the ad engine is sufficiently primed to sustain whatever growth levels Google is experiencing at this point.\n\nFor an investor, the only cause for worry will be the valuation of 6+ times sales. Your returns may take a while to come, so do give yourself some margin for error. The best way is to build your position over a period of time, especially during dips. That way, you get to keep your cost basis down as much as possible, yet accrue value to your portfolio over time.\n\nLooking for great tech stocks?

Won't Be Marketing Its Own Self-Driving Car", "\nHonda and Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo Enter Discussions on Technical ...", "\nHonda in Talks With Google's Waymo on Self-Drive Tech" ], "article_text" : [ "Self-driving car technology is looking more and more like an inevitability with each passing month.\n\nIn this clip from the Industry Focus: Tech podcast, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis and contributor Daniel Sparks explain what Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) subsidiary Waymo has said so far in regards to monetizing autonomous cars (and autonomous car technology), and how realistic the company's plans are.\n\nA full transcript follows the video.\n\nThis podcast was recorded on Dec. 16, 2016.\n\nDylan Lewis: One of the other things we got some color on regarding Google's self-driving car project, I guess I should be calling it Waymo now, is exactly how they plan to monetize self-driving car technology. This is something that's been kind of up in the air for a while. At times, they've talked about not wanting to be a car manufacturer, but it's hard to take them at face value there, because they're looking to obscure this as much as possible. You want to talk a little bit about what we got in terms of commentary there?\n\nDaniel Sparks: Yeah, that was one of the big takeaways when they were coming out with this Waymo announcement. There was some speculation that Alphabet could be working on its own Google-branded car. While they might not actually have thought of planning of manufacturing it, as they do with their hardware products, they often outsource the manufacturing and then slap that brand on, similar to the way Apple does with Foxconn, but, there was some speculation that they could try to be working on some Google-branded car, and we have seen their cars with no steering wheel, their ambitious vision of a totally autonomous driving experience. There has been some speculation in the past that they would be planning to bring a larger fleet of those to the market. But the CEO of Waymo, John Krafcik -- I think that's how you pronounce it?\n\nLewis: I think it's pronounced another way, but I'm not sure. I've only seen it and writing, I have not heard it said. I understand how neither of us are totally sure.\n\nSparks: OK, that sounds better, we'll go with that. We'll just call him John today. John, he emphasized that they're not trying to turn into a car business, but rather wanting to focus on the technology behind the cars, and basically, Waymo's mission to make driving autonomous, to make it safer, and, as in their name, really focus on the mobility. I think this is a good move. This is something that Alphabet has succeeded at in the past by really focusing on software and gathering data -- because, essentially, that's the company's core mission, to organize data. So, by doing this, I'm actually more bullish on the segment by seeing that they're really going to focus on their core competencies with it. And maybe similar to the way Alphabet tries to add in Google-branded hardware later on with Android, maybe they'll do a similar things with cars by trying to bring in Google-branded cars later on after they've really developed and honed in on their expertise and the autonomous area of the technology.", "If both parties agree to enter into a formal agreement, Honda R&D engineers based in Silicon Valley, California and Tochigi, Japan, would work closely with Waymo engineers based in Mountain View, California and Novi, Michigan.\n\nHonda previously announced its intention to put production vehicles with automated driving capabilities on highways sometime around 2020 related to its goal of a collision-free society. In addition to these on-going efforts, this technical collaboration with Waymo could allow Honda R&D to explore a different technological approach to bring fully self-driving technology to market. These discussions are an initial step that will allow Waymo and Honda R&D to further explore the potential of a broad range of automated driving technologies.\n\nAbout Honda R&D Co, Ltd.\n\nHonda R&D Co., Ltd. is an independent subsidiary company of Honda Motor Co., Ltd. and serves as Honda's primary research and development organization for the company's automobile, motorcycle, power products and aviation products.

We're determined to improve transportation for people around the world, building on software and sensor technology developed in Google's labs since 2009. In October 2015, we achieved the world's first fully self-driving trip on public roads, in a car without a steering wheel or pedals. We refine Waymo technology through one billion miles of simulation testing each year, and our cars have self-driven over two million miles on public roads across four U.S. cities.\n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/honda-and-alphabet-incs-waymo-enter-discussions-on-technical-collaboration-of-fully-self-driving-automobile-technology-300382794.html\n\nSOURCE Honda Motor Co., Ltd\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://world.honda.com/RandD\n\n", "Honda Motor Co. said Wednesday it is talking to Waymo, the autonomous driving unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc., to try to strike a deal that would put its self-driving technology into some of the Japanese automaker’s cars.\n\nBoth companies stressed that the talks are about research, rather than full production vehicles, at this point. If all goes well, Honda may provide Waymo with vehicles that are modified to run the self-driving system, and those cars would join the existing Waymo fleet currently being tested in four U.S. cities.\n\nDiscussions with Honda underscore that Waymo wants develop the brains behind self-driving vehicle technology rather than build the cars that use it. The talks also show that Waymo, the new name of Google’s Self-Driving Car Project, is eager to work with more car companies as it races to rack up test miles with its autonomous-drive systems and prepare it for commercialization.\n\n“For companies like Apple and Google, it makes more sense to supply the technology than to get into the car business, which is capital intensive and highly regulated,’’ said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Cox Automotive’s Autotrader.com. “It makes sense for them to provide their technology to companies that are already making cars.’’\n\nWaymo already has a deal with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, which has built 100 Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid minivans equipped with its computers and a suite of sensors, telematics and other systems. FCA’s vehicles will join the company’s fleet of self-driving cars early next year.\n\nGeneral Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. tried to strike deals with Google’s self-driving unit last year, but were unable to do so.\n\nAutomakers had been wary of working with Google, thinking the internet search giant could dominate their businesses, but that attitude is changing, said Mark Bünger, a vice president covering digital transformation at Lux Research.\n\nHonda shares rose 1.2 percent to 3,570 yen as of the close in Tokyo trading Thursday, compared with a 0.1 percent decline for the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.\n\nFirst Step\n\nHonda previously announced plans to start selling self-driving cars capable of operating on highways sometime around 2020. That effort will continue, the company said in a statement. But with Waymo’s help, Honda said it could start considering different technical pathways.\n\n“These discussions are an initial step that will allow Waymo and Honda R&D to further explore the potential of a broad range of automated driving technologies,’’ the automaker said in the statement.\n\nAlphabet announced last week that it was separating the car project into a free-standing business called Waymo as it seeks to sharpen its focus on changing the transportation industry.\n\nJohn Krafcik, who’d previously worked in management at Ford Motor Co. and as chief executive for Hyundai Motor Co.’s U.S. sales unit, is CEO of Waymo.\n\nFrustrating Progress\n\nThe Google project lost several top executives this year as some members of the team were frustrated by the pace of progress, especially as traditional automakers and rivals like Uber Technologies Inc. and Tesla Motors Inc. develop their own autonomous-vehicle systems. After revealing the company name last week, Krafcik didn’t offer any details on Waymo’s plans for a viable commercial business.\n\n“It shows a lot of momentum for the self-driving car project, which had seemed to stall just a few months ago,\" Lux’s Bünger said. \"It matters a lot in the sense that there will be more self-driving cars sooner, available from a variety of automakers.”\n\nWaymo said in a statement it’s \"looking forward to exploring opportunities to collaborate with Honda to advance fully self-driving technology and make our roads safer.\"\n\nJapan’s third-largest automaker, meanwhile, inherited a legacy of fierce independence from its founder Soichiro Honda, who died in 1991. Wednesday’s announcement reflects the growing credibility of Waymo’s self-driving technologies. It also shows the immense strain automakers face not just in the race toward self-driving, but also in the simultaneous upheavals taking place in ride-sharing and the electrification of the engines to meet emissions limits.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nWhile cautious regarding the need for drivers to maintain responsibility for vehicle operation, Honda has made its semi-autonomous technology package, called Honda Sensing, available on affordable models including its compact Civic. Similar packages of features such as lane-keep assist and adaptive cruise control are typically found on luxury models such as the Volvo XC90, Lexus LS 460 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.\n\nPartnering with Waymo should help Honda speed development of its own self-driving systems or decide to use what the Google unit has developed.\n\n“If you’re Honda, and you’re a master craftsman, and you have the opportunity to partner with the leading provider of technology in this space, maybe you learn something,” said Mike Ramsey, research director at Gartner Inc." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.173546511627907, 0.08537321264593992, 0.06144830659536542 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.5157622739018086, 0.3611045520136429, 0.4342884729649435 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-22T00:00:00.000+0000" }, null, { "$date" : "2016-12-21T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

This remains true despite a paltry 4% gain for Google stock in 2016. Investors will forgive a company when its return over five years are over 150%, almost twice the gains of the S&P 500.\n\nMany InvestorPlace writers love GOOGL. Chris Katje thinks its Wing Marketplace, a food delivery start-up, could soon stand on its own. Chris Tyler says you should buy Google stock for a breakout to the upside. Craig Adeyanju insists it leads the self-driving space and is well positioned. Ryan Fuhrmann says the boom story is not over.\n\nBut Alphabet is no longer politically favored. CEO Larry Page’s attendance at the Trump “tech summit” continues to anger the company’s allies. Tech companies have reason to fear Trump. GOOGL has $58 billion in cash overseas and the company is not on the President-elect’s Christmas card list.\n\nGOOGL Priced to Perfection\n\nWhen most smart people are predicting great things, it is always wise to consider a bear case. When everyone is in a stock, or any financial instrument, it makes a fall more likely.\n\nRight now, Alphabet is priced to near-perfection — it has a price-to-earnings multiple of 29 — and it is anticipating a steady rise in profits. That looks baked-in for 2016, with $20.77 per share in net income already booked against last year’s $22.84. The balance sheet looks pristine and cash flow is accelerating, reaching over $26 billion just last quarter.\n\nSo far, so good … but Google is changing its alphabet.\n\nThe company’s past is based entirely on cloud software delivering advertising revenues. Google has spent 2016 preparing for a big push into hardware, with a new phone to go against the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone, a voice-activated assistant to go after Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Alexa, a VR headset to go against the Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) Oculus, and a new router that will compete with carrier-delivered gear from Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) and AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ).\n\nThere are two types of risk associated with this move. There is the market risk of going against other big companies. And there is political risk, because every move of the search engine will now be measured against what it means for its growing hardware ecosystem.\n\nThere is reason to believe Alphabet knows this. Google Fiber is being scaled back, and the auto business, now called Waymo, is being slowly transformed from a carmaker to a parts-and-software supplier.\n\nAlphabet Can Lose\n\nGOOGL is already facing political headwinds, especially in Europe, which has filed an antitrust case and is demanding global censorship of the internet resource, including erasing statements from people supportive of the new U.S. Administration.\n\nGoogle was already under pressure on issues of privacy and the so-called “Right to be Forgotten,” designed to make negative statements on people more difficult to trace. Google is still being kept out of China as that country demands the same thing Europe does, obedience to local laws even when they conflict with American norms.\n\nNext Page", "CEO of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Lawrence Page sold 66,664 shares of GOOG on 12/22/2016 at an average price of $799.9 a share.

Earnings: Mark Your Calendar", "\nThis Is Where Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Will Thrive", "\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG): What to Expect from Google Stock in 2017" ], "article_text" : [ "Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is set to report results for its fourth quarter of 2016 on Thursday, Jan. 26. Before the numbers for the quarter are released, here's a broad overview of some areas to watch.\n\nRevenue and EPS\n\nThe pressure is certainly on for Alphabet's fourth quarter, especially after the company's expectation-beating quarter before it. For Alphabet's third quarter, both the company's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) exceeded expectations. Revenue and non-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting principles) EPS was $22.5 billion and $9.06, respectively, up significantly from $18.7 billion and $7.35, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, on average, expected third-quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $22.1 billion and $8.63.\n\nGoing into Alphabet's fourth quarter, analysts expect robust growth to continue, albeit not as sharply. On average, analysts expect fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $25.1 billion and $9.63, up 18% and 11%, respectively, year over year.\n\nMetric Q3 YOY Growth Q3 YOY Growth Implied by Consensus Analyst Estimate Revenue 20% 18% Non-GAAP EPS 23% 11%\n\nThere's merit to analysts' conservatism, particularly since Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat went out of her way during the company's third-quarter earnings call to remind analysts that the company will be up against tough year-ago revenue comparisons in the fourth quarter.\n\nPaid clicks and cost-per-clicks\n\nOne of the reasons why Alphabet outperformed expectations in Q3 was because of its big increase in paid clicks, or the total number of clicks for which advertisers paid Google. Aggregate paid clicks in Q3 were up 9% sequentially and 33% year over year. Notably, some of the benefits from such a large increase in paid clicks was offset by 5% and 11% decreases in cost-per-click, or the amount advertisers pay Alphabet for each click, but the outsized gain in paid clicks was significant enough to help drive significant revenue growth.\n\nInvestors should look for look for similar trends in Alphabet's paid clicks and cost-per-clicks in Q4. If the trends diverge in an unexpected direction, investors may want to look for an explanation from management during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nNew Google products\n\nAlso, after launching some new Google-branded hardware, investors also may want to look for some updates from management on how these products are faring. While the new products still almost certainly will be immaterial to overall results, a promising start for the new devices could signal bigger opportunity ahead.\n\nIn October, Alphabet launched two new significant products: a Google Pixel smartphone and a Google Home artificial intelligence-enabled smart speaker. The Pixel quickly sold out online, and Google Home ended up selling out in many stores during the holidays -- evidence of the high demand for these new products. Indeed, in a statement to 9to5Google, a Google spokesperson specifically said demand was to blame for the Pixel selling out:\n\nWe're thrilled to see the excitement for our new Pixel phones, and frankly pre-order demand has exceeded our expectations. We're working to restock our inventory as soon as possible.\n\nWhile Alphabet hasn't yet proven it can build a sustainable and meaningful hardware business, maybe the Pixel smartphone and Google Home could finally change this.\n\nAlphabet will report its fourth-quarter results immediately after market close on Jan. 26. Management will host a conference call to discuss the results at 4:30 p.m. EST.", "What’s the first thing you think about when it comes to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL )? There’s a good chance that Search is at the top of your list. After all, its former namesake search site has been driving the cash flows and profits at GOOGL stock for years. Especially since it has data-mined those results to sell plenty of ads and generate significant advertising revenues.\n\nSource: Google\n\nBut Google isn’t a one-trick pony.\n\nLike rivals such as Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), GOOGL has become one heck of a device and products maker. And while it’s easy to dismiss these gadgets as “hobby business” or non-core operations, the reality is, they are paramount to Google’s underlying mission and business.\n\nIn the end, device growth — and what Google does with those devices — is the real driver for GOOGL stock.\n\nOver 157 Products at Google\n\nIn total, GOOGL makes over 157 different products for customers. And while the vast bulk of them are Web-based applications — Gmail, Maps, Chrome, etc. — the firm has continued to plow some big-time dollars onto the physical device market.\n\nThat may make GOOGL investors a tad bit nervous considering how poorly of an investment Motorola turned out to be for Google. If you remember, GOOGL paid more than $12 billion for the cellphone manufacturer, only to sell it at steep $10 billion loss a few years later. But what Google kept in the sale — some valuable technology patents and applications — is what is going to drive Alphabet’s dominance over the device market.\n\nIn recent months, Alphabet has launched new home artificial intelligence equipment, smartphones, virtual reality headsets and home WiFi units. These products join GOOGL’s cadre of Nest WiFi-enabled thermostats and home automation products, Chromebooks and tablets. You name it.\n\nAnd while many of these items are very impressive in their technology and have caught on with consumers — Nest and its Pixel phones in particular — none of these devices have become huge money makers for Alphabet. Revenues for Google’s physical tools are pretty non-existent and in some products, are actually losses.\n\nSo why would Google want even to dabble in device market? It seems that it should just be focusing on ways to continue generating ad sales from is core search operations. But building out ad sales is exactly what GOOGL is doing. To understand why we just need to look at one of its competitors.\n\nBig Data Opportunity for GOOGL Stock\n\nAmazon’s Fire Tablet and new Echo home device aren’t really about making your life easier — it’s about selling you that next movie or book. It’s a way to distribute Amazon’s content and products. In all of this, Amazon is collecting tons of data on your preferences — by what you click and say — to sell you more items down the road.\n\nAnd that is exactly what GOOGL is doing.\n\nIf you’re not searching for something or checking your email, Google has no idea what you’re up to. But slap a home automation device on your wall, smartwatch on your wrist and AI chip in your car, and suddenly Big Brother knows what you’re all about. And in that data collection is where Alphabet is going to thrive.\n\nNext Page", "By Gaurav S. Iyer, IFC Published : January 12, 2017\n\nA More Streamlined Google Stock (GOOG)\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is reportedly trying to sell one of its satellite divisions, a business that it bought in 2014 for $500.0 million. This sale would suggest Alphabet’s upper management is getting serious about cost-cutting, and that they are willing to do the dirty work needed to ensure a bright future for Google stock (GOOG).\n\nA competing satellite-imagery firm named Planet Labs Inc. wants to take the business off Alphabet’s hands, but it is still a small startup.\n\nThe hope is that it can raise enough money to complete a “cash plus equity deal,” which would suggest that Alphabet will retain some stake in the enterprise even after selling it. (Source: “Google in Talks to Sell Its Satellite Business,” The Wall Street Journal, January 10, 2017.)\n\nBut the important point to remember is that any associated costs will get wiped off the company’s income statement. That is a really big deal for Google stock, not because this satellite business was terrible or anything, but because it shows commitment to shareholder value.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, Google has thrown money around without a second thought. To be fair, its monopoly over the search engine market was so absolute that it could afford to do that. As the online advertising business grew bigger, GOOG stock continued to rise.\n\nThis was the basic equation that propelled Google stock over the last decade and a half.\n\nThe internet behemoth managed to stay atop the tech world by playing the odds. It would invest in a bunch of interesting new technologies with the hopes that one or two of them would eventually become a product. That’s how “Android,” “Maps,” and the “Chromecast” came into existence.\n\nBut now it’s time for a little belt-tightening. In order to keep Google stock moving “up and to the right” there needs to be more money-makers and fewer science projects. If you take a close look at what Alphabet has been doing over the last year, it’s pretty clear that it’s making the right moves.\n\nFor instance, it spun the driverless car project into a full-fledged business called “Waymo” (yes, I know it’s a terrible name, but it could be a golden goose) and unveiled a fleet of self-driving minivans. (Source: “A first look at our Waymo fully self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans,” Medium, December 18, 2016.)\n\nSince Waymo isn’t manufacturing the cars, but simply licensing the technology to carmakers like Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) or Toyota Motor Corp (ADR) (NYSE:TM), it could become a profit center much sooner than other firms in the same industry.\n\nWe’re talking billions of dollars here. Put that in perspective with the imminent sale of Alphabet’s satellite-imagery business. What you’ll see is a company that is focused, a company that is slashing unnecessary costs and cranking up its earning potential.\n\nFrom a fundamentals perspective, this would suggest that Google stock is grossly underrated. We expect the share price to explode this year, particularly in the third and fourth quarters." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.107346796229775, 0.1331326081326081, 0.04706295477572073 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4950057566546928, 0.4579152329152329, 0.4510592244634797 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-01-11T00:00:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-11T16:51:48.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-12T07:18:34.000+0000" } ] }

(IBM) Stock Is Making a Comeback" ], "article_text" : [ "Though they play in different sandboxes in most areas, there is one significant similarity between IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL): Both are noted innovators. Alphabet's early forays into self-driving cars, nanotechnologies, and wearables -- among a host of other futuristic endeavors -- have set it apart.\n\nThe notion of IBM as an innovator is more recent, but significant strides in cognitive computing, big data, and cloud analytics has positioned Big Blue on the cutting edge. But the two behemoths are markedly different from an investor's perspective. This makes answering the question of which is the better buy an intriguing one.\n\nThe case for Alphabet\n\nAlphabet's stock has performed relatively poorly this year, up just 4.5% despite growing at a phenomenal clip, which is particularly impressive given it's one of the largest companies on the planet. Meanwhile, IBM isn't posting revenue gains quarter in and quarter out, yet its stock has shot up over 21% year to date.\n\nA year ago, Alphabet generated $18.68 billion in total revenue, a 13% improvement over 2014's third quarter. And that paled in comparison to 2016's third quarter, in which revenue climbed 20% year over year, to $22.45 billion. The fact Alphabet is gaining sales momentum at its size is largely due to its focus on mobile search and video, a recognized area of weakness a year ago.\n\nThanks in part to improving margins, earnings per share soared 27% last quarter despite Alphabet's infamous spending: Both cost of revenue and operating expense increased. However, Alphabet's other revenues skyrocketed 39% in the third quarter, and its \"Other Bets\" losses narrowed. Alphabet's spending is beginning to pay off, which bodes extremely well for continuing its stellar run.\n\nThe case for IBM\n\nInvestors and pundits seem to realize that for IBM, total revenue takes a backseat to its \"strategic imperatives\" results -- which explains why IBM shareholders are enjoying a banner year. Last quarter's $19.2 billion in sales was flat compared to a year ago, when the company posted a solid result compared with the revenue declines of the past.\n\nIBM's strategic imperatives -- which include data security and mobile sales, in addition to the aforementioned cloud, analytics, and cognitive computing -- generated $8 billion in the quarter, up 16% compared to a year ago. CEO Ginni Rometty's focus on the sales of cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) and business process solutions is driving IBM's strong results.\n\nThis year cloud-related SaaS and business process revenue is expected to generate over $80 billion, which explains IBM's phenomenal annual run-rate increase of 66% in the third quarter in what it calls cloud as a service. The annual run rate of $7.5 billion in cloud service sales last quarter was nearly a third of IBM's total strategic imperatives revenue of $31.8 billion.\n\nSurprisingly, IBM actually enjoyed a slight decrease in total expense and other income in the third quarter. The spending decline was surprising in that IBM has invested literally billions of dollars in its strategic imperatives this year alone. And then there's the appeal of IBM's 3.4% dividend yield to investors in search of income. By contrast, Alphabet steadfastly refuses to pay a dividend, though it is giving back to shareholders via its recently announced $7 billion stock repurchase plan.\n\nWhich is the better buy?\n\nAlphabet should continue to report quarterly sales and earnings that are simply off the charts, but it's become a victim of its own success. When 20% revenue growth and 27% per-share earnings gains warrant little more than a yawn from investors, it calls into question how much upside Alphabet really offers. That said, its stock should slowly but surely climb over the years, just not as much as it has earned based on its financials.\n\nIBM stock isn't likely to skyrocket any time soon, either. But what IBM stock should do is continue its steady climb, translating to more upside than Alphabet over the long haul -- because of the company's strategic imperatives success, and because it had underperformed for so long. Add in a solid dividend and the nod goes to IBM.", "One could never confuse International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) with Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) or even Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) for that matter. However, those looking for income in 2017 should put aside all the negativity that has followed IBM stock in recent years and add it to your portfolio.\n\nHere’s why.\n\nThe key to any good dividend stock is consistently growing dividends. IBM has increased dividends for 21 consecutive years; in the last five years, International Business Machines has averaged annual dividend growth of 13.4%, a positive sign for anyone looking for yields of 3% or higher.\n\nIBM stock currently yields a healthy 3.3% despite its stock being up 21% year-to-date through Dec. 27.\n\nIt’s especially positive given how much free cash flow the company has been allocating toward share repurchases in recent years. Since 2012, it has reduced its share count by 16.5% to 964 million shares. During those three years, it repurchased $32.2 billion of its stock and paid out another $13 billion in dividends representing 112.4% of its cumulative free cash flow.\n\nIt’s no secret, then, why International Business Machines’ revenues shrunk from $102.9 billion in 2012 to $81.7 billion in 2015 and non-GAAP operating earnings declined by 18% over the same period — a lack of investment in research and development and no meaningful acquisitions to speak of has literally been choking the life out of IBM.\n\nHowever, all that appears to have changed in 2015, providing dividend investors with a renewed interest in IBM stock.\n\nWhat’s Going on With IBM Stock?\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, International Business Machines paid out $18 billion for share repurchases and dividends; in 2015, that dropped to $9.5 billion and so far, through the first three-quarters of 2016, it has shelled out just $6.5 billion, which means the company will have more available to pay down some of its $35.6 billion in long-term debt while still increasing the amount it invests in R&D.\n\nAt the height of its free cash flow in 2012, IBM was generating $18.2 billion, paying out 86% of it to shareholders. In 2016, if International Business Machines generates $15 billion in free cash flow and allocates no more than $9 billion to shareholders, it will have paid out just 60% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends and share repurchases, leaving a substantial amount to reinvest in its business.\n\nIBM has been on a journey over the last decade and it still has a lot of work left to regain a prominent place in technology. That said, it has made progress.\n\nIn 2005, its gross margin was 40%; today, it’s 11 percentage points higher. A big driver of that is its software and services business, which includes the cloud. While its overall revenues are falling, International Business Machines’ revenue from strategic imperatives established in 2014 such as big data, analytics, cloud, mobile, social and security are rising.\n\nIn 2015, revenue from its strategic imperatives increased by 26% excluding currency to $28.9 billion or 35% of its overall revenue.

(GOOGL) Stock Slumps on Q4 Earnings Miss", "\nAlphabet earnings: Google may shift focus to cloud as search business slows" ], "article_text" : [ "Highlighting a somewhat muted response from investors, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is trading about 0.4% lower at the time of this writing on Friday after the company reported its results for the fourth quarter of 2016. While revenue jumped 22% to $26.1 billion and surpassed analysts' consensus estimate (via Thomson Reuters) for revenue of $25.2 billion, the company's earnings of $9.36 per share fell short of a projection for $9.64.\n\nAs investors digest the information from Alphabet's latest report, here's a look at some of the most insightful comments from the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. In these quotes, management discusses the success of the new Google-branded hardware, further opportunity in advertising, and what it considers the three biggest bets for the company beyond its core ad business.\n\nAlphabet's core search business hasn't peaked -- far from it\n\nAfter pointing to the company's impressive 20% consolidated revenue growth in 2016, which management emphasized is actually 24% when excluding the impact of currency headwinds, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat emphasized (via a Reuters transcript) the opportunity ahead:\n\nThis performance is a testament to the ongoing innovation that is driving our success in mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising, each of which we believe has only begun to scratch the surface. We remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped.\n\nThese could become major revenue drivers\n\nWith about 86% of Alphabet's total revenue coming from advertising, it's always nice to get an update on whether the company is seeing success on diversifying its revenue sources. To this end, Alphabet made excellent progress in its fourth quarter. Here's what Porat had to say:\n\nAlongside these [advertising] businesses, we are focused on growing additional revenue streams within Google over the medium- and long-term. In 2016, our other revenue line grew 41% on a full year basis reflecting the growth in our Play, hardware and cloud businesses. We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube. We're investing in our cloud and hardware businesses, as well as our newer non-ad revenue sources for YouTube, in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years.\n\nAlphabet's other revenue growth in the Google segment (not to be confused with Alphabet's \"other bets\") was even more impressive in the company's fourth quarter specifically. Fourth-quarter other revenue soared 62% year over year, to $3.4 billion, accounting for 13% of total revenue, up from 10% of revenue in the year-ago quarter. Management cited hardware, the Google Play app store, and its cloud business as key drivers for the segment.\n\nGoogle-branded hardware looks promising\n\nDrilling down more narrowly on the company's nascent hardware business, which received some extra attention from the company in the fourth quarter when Google launched its voice-activated smart speaker (Google Home) and a new smartphone (Google Pixel), management was optimistic about how new hardware is performing in the marketplace. Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained:\n\nWe introduced a new family of beautiful hardware devices in October that are made by Google, led by Google Home and our Pixel phone which feature the Google Assistant built in. We're thrilled with the reception, as well as the really happy customers we saw over the holiday season. In particular, Google Home was a very popular present that many people opened on Christmas morning. We have committed to this for the long-term, as a great way to bring a beautiful seamless Google experience to people. The early signs are promising, and you can expect us to see us expand our offerings thoughtfully.\n\nAlphabet's three big bets\n\nPichai said that beyond its core advertising business, the company distinctly views \"YouTube, cloud and hardware\" as \"three of our biggest bets.\" So investors should keep an eye on these areas as Alphabet continues to grow its business.\n\nManagement's extreme confidence in incremental opportunity in Alphabet's core search business, along with significant and promising growth in YouTube, cloud, and hardware, continues to make a great case for owning this stock. Not only is the company strengthening the competitive position of its core business, but it's also diversifying its revenue while simultaneously opening the doors to meaningful opportunities beyond advertising.", "Alphabet Inc. ( GOOGL ) just released its fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results, posting earnings of $7.56 per share and revenue of $26.064 billion.\n\nGOOGL was down 2.22% to $837.99 in after-hours trading shortly after its earnings report was released.\n\nCurrently, GOOGL has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), but it is subject to change following the release of the company's latest earnings report.

Management will likely be upbeat on the growth of video engagement and sales of its artificial intelligence products.\n\nSee also: Google’s Pixel business could be bigger than Fitbit and GoPro combined\n\nThis quarter will also be the first to include sales of the Pixel smartphone, which was released in October. Not all analysts are convinced the new Android phone performed well in a market saturated with the likes of Apple Inc.’s AAPL, +0.22% iPhone and Samsung Electronics’ 005930, +0.48% Galaxy line.\n\nHere’s what to expect:\n\nEarnings: Sell-side analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Alphabet to report adjusted profit of $9.64 a share, compared with $8.67 in the year-earlier period. Contributors to Estimize, a software platform that uses crowdsourcing from hedge fund executives, brokerages and buy-side analysts to predict earnings, expect Alphabet to report adjusted earnings of $9.76 a share. The company has surpassed both consensus estimates in four of the past five quarters.\n\nWatch: Google’s self-driving cars equipped with new sensors\n\nRevenue: The company is expected to report revenue of $20.6 billion, compared with $17.3 billion in the year-earlier period, according to the FactSet and Estimize consensus estimates. Alphabet has topped both expectations in three of the past four quarters.\n\nStock reaction: Shares of Alphabet have underperformed the market since its last earnings report, increasing 3% in the past three months and 16% in the past year. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.11% , by comparison, is up 7% in three months and 22% on the year. The average rating on Alphabet’s stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average 12-month price target is $960.59, according to a FactSet survey of roughly 30 analysts. Shares of Alphabet closed $858.45 at Wednesday. They traded down 0.4% to $854.79 Thursday afternoon.\n\nWhat to watch for: This will be the first quarter to highlight Pixel smartphone sales, the company’s iPhone rival that sells at a similarly premium price point. In a note to clients last week, Mizuho analyst Neil Doshi raised his estimate on Alphabet’s Pixel phone to 1 million units for the quarter. The Pixel outlook prompted Mizuho to raise its revenue estimate slightly, to $20.5 billion from $19.9 billion.\n\nWill augmented reality or virtual reality win? (3:11) Augmented and virtual reality are growing into multibillion-dollar businesses that will transform how users shop, work and communicate. Intel, HTC, Lenovo and Alphabet showed their latest innovations at CES in Las Vegas.\n\nHowever, Doshi, who has a buy rating and $1,025 target on the stock, said he’s “somewhat skeptical that the Pixel can gain material near-term share,” particularly since Verizon is the only wireless carrier that sells the phone to its customers. The global smartphone industry has decelerated significantly in recent years as customers wait longer to upgrade their phones and purchase unlocked and refurbished phones from third-party retail sites.\n\nMeanwhile, Google continues to face advertising pressure amid declines in its core search product. The growth of paid clicks on ads across its sites is expected to increase 26.2% this quarter, according to the FactSet estimate. That would mark a deceleration from 33% last quarter and 31% in the year-earlier period.\n\nRead also: Google says driverless cars are ready to make money, but we won’t know if they do\n\nPacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves said management could begin to shift the focus to its newer business lines in addition to its legacy products, such as its cloud services and new video programs. In 2017, YouTube is expected to introduce a multichannel video programming distributor service, enabling Google to provide cable-like television services.\n\n“Momentum in other businesses with large opportunities will likely be important to maintaining sentiment around Google as the core search business slowly decelerates over the near to medium term,” he said." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.2376391621846167, 0.1430555555555555, -0.008306486794858892 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.5266403209585028, 0.4262152777777778, 0.4202968220410081 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-01-27T00:00:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-26T10:35:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-25T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

As the online advertising race between Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) and Facebook ( NASDAQ:FB ) intensifies, the internet giant has no choice but to address the issue quickly.\n\nThis video was recorded on March 27, 2017.\n\nChris Hill: It's Monday, March 27th. Welcome to Market Foolery. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me in studio today, from Million Dollar Portfolio, Jason Moser; and from Stock Advisor Canada, Taylor Muckerman. Happy Monday!\n\nJason Moser: Hey, now!\n\nTaylor Muckerman: We're doing it!\n\nHill: We are doing it. Welcome back! You've been busy.\n\nMuckerman: Yeah, a couple weeks. You were at South by Southwest. We've been overlapping each other.\n\nHill: There we go. It's good to have you back in the studio.\n\nMuckerman: It's good to be back.\n\nHill: We're going to dip into the Fool mailbag. We have to start with a story that's been brewing for a little while. I'll be honest. This is a story, I saw a headline on this a week or two ago, and it registered like, huh, that's interesting, and it continues to balloon. This is the fact that a week ago, Google formally apologized for running customer's ads alongside objectionable videos. We've talked before about YouTube and how important it is in the world of search, and how it's one of the most popular places to search. And you see these stories about, if YouTube was a stand-alone company, it'd be worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 billion. Google makes this apology a week ago, and here we are a week later, and I guess, among other things, Jason, probably a reminder that YouTube is a really big place with lots of videos, and therefore it's hard even for the owners to monitor it. The Wall Street Journal had this big story about how Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Amazon, Procter & Gamble, these mainstream brands, are still seeing their ads alongside videos with racist content, anti-Semitic, all of this stuff where the advertisers, rightfully so, say, \"I don't want my ads next to that.\"\n\nMoser: Yeah. We're going to hit a point here, sooner or later, it's going to be like you do with your kids, they can say sorry only so many times before you're like, \"I get that you're sorry. Just don't do it again. I'm not looking for sorry anymore.\" So, I think with Google and YouTube, this is obviously something that's a big deal. It's not something that immediately impacts their bottom line. When we talk about the bread and butter for Google's money-making machine, it's search advertising. But, there's a good percentage, close to 20% of that money, comes through advertising with third-party customers. So, when ads go next to objectionable content, of course, those parties are going to express concern, they want to know what's going on, why is this happening, and what are you going to do to make it stop? Because there is no middle ground here. It's just, flat-out, \"This is unacceptable, don't let it happen anymore.\" This is sort of one of those things with this age of automation, as we go more toward automating everything, particularly on the consumer-facing side, I think it's really difficult to ever fall back on the old, \"Well, the algorithm did it, it wasn't our fault.\" Because, ultimately, someone built the algorithm.\n\nI think what Google needs to figure out here is, what is happening to make this happen, and how do they fix it? And whether it is through technology, whether it's through humanizing it a little bit more, and actually bringing on more people to add a human touch to these customer relationships, they need to do something with this before this gets out of hand.\n\nWe've talked about this a lot, especially in MDP, we own shares of Alphabet, and we own shares of Facebook: We own a far larger position in Facebook, and part of the reason for that is, when you look at the direction things are headed in social, and in internet behavior, there's no question that Facebook is becoming a place, not just Facebook, but its properties, whether it's WhatsApp or Instagram or whatever properties they buy in the future, that's a place where eyeballs go to hang out for a while. Google is more utilitarian in nature, right? You need some information, you find it on Google, and you go to your next place. Facebook is catching up very quickly. They've expressed some concerns that perhaps the last decade was the Google decade, and perhaps this next decade is the Facebook decade. If that is the case, and the numbers certainly point toward that, the argument could at least be made there, Google has got to figure out something yesterday as to how to address this and fix it, because blaming it on the technology is not going to fly.\n\nMuckerman: I'm pretty confident that they're going to figure out a way to fix it. Especially when you're talking about Facebook, they had the whole issue around the election with fake news on their site. And you had a group of college kids come out and make an algorithm that was able to identify fake news on the site, and they've been able -- not using their algorithm, but, Facebook has been able to address that. I'm confident that Google will. You talk about big headlines about this, but I'm waiting for the headline to come out that says, right now, people think that less than 1% of Google's revenue is at risk because of this. It's a $90 billion revenue company, I've seen headlines that say $750 million might come off of YouTube's revenue in 2017 because of this. Bigger fraction of YouTube's revenue, but you're not just an investor in YouTube when you buy a stock in Alphabet. So, I'm still confident that they'll figure it out. And between the two of them, Facebook and Google, they're pretty much the only two that are growing in the digital ad space. So, I find it hard to believe that advertisers are going to completely move away from Google. Right now, Facebook is really the only alternative, and that space would become far too crowded too quickly if there was a mass exodus from Google. I'm fairly confident that, because you said 20% of their revenue comes from that search advertising, they're going to figure this out.\n\nHill: It is a small amount of money, and yet, when you look at the headline of Pepsi, Starbucks, General Motors, Wal-Mart have pulled some of their ad spend with YouTube. Those are big-name companies. I think, if you're Facebook, you're not throwing a parade over this, but I think if you're selling video advertising for Facebook, you're on the phone to different media agencies, and I also think television networks. If you're a broadcast network or cable network, to use your phrase, Jason, you're putting the human touch to work, and you're calling these companies and saying, \"Listen, don't take a risk with the programmatic algorithm approach to YouTube. You know what you're going to get with our networks, and you're going to get something that associates well with your brand.\"\n\nMuckerman: With some of those companies you mentioned, those are companies that can afford to pull back for a week or two on advertising and make a statement. That's almost advertising in itself. They're still advertising using Google's name, just not using Google's platform. So, I think they'll come back eventually. Probably not too far down the line. Those brands are brands already. You're probably looking at the smaller players, questioning whether or not they can afford to back off of Google's platform a little bit more than Coke or Pepsi.\n\nMoser: Yeah, and I think it's also worth noting, for the longest time, YouTube has been synonymous with online video. That's what got this ball rolling. And they've enjoyed such a phenomenal competitive position for so long. What an acquisition Google made for ... what did they buy it for?\n\nHill: $1.6 billion.\n\nMuckerman: Pennies on the current dollar.\n\nHill: And the reason I remember it was $1.6 billion is because I was one of the people saying, \"Boy, they sure did pay a lot of money for that.\"\n\nMoser: So, I think you fast forward today and you see how this competitive environment has changed, Google and YouTube are not the only players in the online video space. And you see all sorts of companies, from Facebook and Twitter to Verizon and AT&T developing their online video offerings. To your point, I think it's very easy to see these customers pulling back for a week, a month, and saying, \"Hey, let's reasses what's going on here.\" Google and YouTube are too big to say, \"We don't want to be a part of your environment.\" That's just foregoing a tremendous reach that anybody in their right mind would want to be a part of. But, what it could do is, it could result in some pricing competition. It can certainly make Google have to get in there and compete a bit more on pricing, lose a bit, perhaps, of that pricing power, particularly as we ship to mobile, and we know those mobile advertisements are not nearly as lucrative as the desktops were, from a real estate perspective. But, these are smart people running a very, very big company. The solution to this really is as simple as, listen to your customers and give them what they want. So, from that perspective, I don't see any reason why they can't fix it. I guess it's going to be interesting to see how they fix it, and how quickly they go about fixing it, because they don't enjoy that same competitive position that they enjoyed, perhaps, five years ago.\n\nHill: Our email address is marketfoolery@fool.com. From Matt Saunders in Nestleton, Ontario. \"I was hoping you could explain the effects of currency exchange on stock purchases. I'm in Canada and our dollar is quite low compared to the U.S. dollar. However, it wasn't too many years ago, we peaked a little higher than the U.S. dollar. My concern is that if I buy a U.S. company at this point and the dollar rises again, will that work against the value of the U.S. company that I purchased? Or does buying on the TSX compensate for that somehow? Thanks for all your help with this. P.S. please tell Steve Broido, we just made a trip to Orlando and had a great visit to an Olive Garden there. Definitely a fan.\" Steve will appreciate that, I'm sure.\n\nMuckerman: Yeah. Thanks for listening all the way from Ontario. This was a question that we receive quite often in Stock Advisor Canada, Pro Canada, and now Dividend Investor Canada. We put a special report about this a couple years back. Over those couple years, not much has changed. Remain to see the Canadian dollar still trading below the U.S. dollar. I think right now, it's around $0.75 to the U.S. dollar. As you did mention earlier in the 2000s, the Canadian dollar did peak around $1.20 to the U.S. dollar. That ramp-up really did cramp Canadian investors' returns when you look at it, from investing in the U.S. dollar. When the Canadian dollar does appreciate, you lose a little bit there when you sell back into the Canadian market. So, what we generally tell our members to do is, A) we absolutely recommend investing in the U.S. market, because when you look at the Canadian market, about two-thirds of it relies on the energy, financials, and the materials sector, two very volatile sectors, in the energy and materials sector and then financials, really, the bulk of that is driven by the big banks, TD, Scotia, CIBC, BMO, and RBC. They're very highly concentrated if you don't move outside of the Canadian market. When you look at the largest sector in the U.S., IT, I think that's around almost 22% of the S&P, it's 2.7% of the S&P TSX. So, you're missing out on a lot of potential growth there. And less than 1% of the S&P TSX is healthcare. If you think about that, you're missing out on some huge potential growth there. It was a little higher, but Valeant obviously reduced the share of that overall market when that fell precipitously over the last couple years.\n\nBut, the long-term average of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar is right around $0.85. There's about 13% upside from where it is right now until it reaches the long-term average, I think we have information going back to 1971 on our site. That's over 30 to 40 years of data with the long-term average of $0.85 to the U.S. dollar. So, you're not far away from that. Compared to that $1.20 you saw in the early 2000s, we view that as a one-off event, especially with oil where it is these days, and the likelihood that remains subdued as compared to when it was over $100, which, coincidentally, timed very well with when it was peaking with the U.S. dollar there. So, we advocate people considering the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar exchange rate, but we don't say, \"Just invest Canadian only.\" Put some dollars into a separate account, leave them there for the long-term so you don't have to pay the cost to exchange back and forth, because banks do charge for that. And you don't get charged if the company pays you a U.S. dollar dividend and you leave it in U.S. dollars. You don't get charged every time they deposit the dividend to your account. You only get charged if you put it back into CAD. So, if you're a long-term investor, we just say, create two accounts, one with Canadian dollars and one with U.S. dollars, and let it ride, because if you don't, you're going to miss out on tons of opportunity. TSX and TSX Venture stocks make up about 20% of the --\n\nHill: Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nMuckerman: Yep. They make up about 20% of the total stocks available to you in U.S. markets. So, not only are you missing out on diversification, but you're missing out on opportunity, in terms of breadth of choices. So, don't let the currency fluctuations scare you away from it. That's our opinion.\n\nHill: You've been to the Toronto Stock Exchange, haven't you?\n\nMuckerman: Yeah, it's pretty cool. We went there a few years ago, poked around when we were first launching Stock Advisor Canada in 2013. Been up there a couple times since, but to not the same fanfare that we went up there a few years back.\n\nHill: Definitely a lot of fun. Fitting that I'm sitting with too proud sons of the Carolinas because, for any sports fans out there, the final four is set. We have Gonzaga, we have the University of North Carolina, we have Oregon, and we have, surprisingly, the University of South Carolina. And the potential for an all-Carolina final.\n\nMoser: Amazing. If you think about it this way, you had Clemson just win the National Championship in college football. There is still the potential, certainly, for the Gamecocks to go in there and win this thing in basketball. Which, I mean, there's no way that's ever been achieved before.\n\nMuckerman: They have to win this, because the likelihood of a potential rematch with North Carolina in the final, highly unlikely. Although, this could boost recruiting.\n\nMoser: About half of my graduating class in high school went to USC. The other half --\n\nHill: The other USC. Most people hear USC and they think University of Southern California.\n\nMoser: The East Coast, South Carolina. The other half went the Clemson. And I was the one lone straggler that went the opposite direction and went to a 15-person liberal arts college. Go, Wofford Terriers.\n\nHill: Wait, isn't Wofford in North Carolina?\n\nMoser: Wofford is in South Carolina. You have Davidson that's in North Carolina.\n\nMuckerman: Steph Curry.\n\nMoser: But, wow, the finish to that game yesterday was ...\n\nMuckerman: The Carolina game? Yeah, my gosh.\n\nMoser: Yeah, it was unbelievable. I have to believe that right now, the Carolinas are figuring out a way to, perhaps, join together, erase that border.\n\nHill: There was a story I read this morning -- and, obviously, there's so many millions of dollars involved in the NCAA basketball tournament. But one of the stories I read this morning was about the business impact in North and South Carolina. And, not surprisingly, bars and restaurants doing huge business over the weekend, and presumably will do it again next weekend.\n\nMoser: That'd be like one of those things in an earnings report where, that's one of those one-time events. So, when you're saying, \"Well, we don't expect this next March, but we had a very robust beginning of 2017, thanks to ... \"\n\nHill: You're saying Jason's Barbecue and Sports Bar, in South Carolina, when it's reporting earnings in the spring of 2018, it's like, \"Look, tough comp. Last year, we had the final four. We had Clemson in the football championship.\"\n\nMuckerman: Seriously. Clemson. USC has to catch up. Maybe think about extending Tobacco Road a little for their South.\n\nHill: I don't know how big the concentration of Buffalo Wild Wings is in the Carolinas but I do remember --\n\nMuckerman: There's quite a few.\n\nHill: -- two years ago, when Tom Brady was first suspended by the NFL, and he was going to miss four games, and this was going into the fall of 2015, I do remember that on a conference call, there was an analyst who asked CEO Sally Smith, this analysts had the numbers and basically said, \"Here's how many Buffalo Wild Wings locations are in New England. Tom Brady is going to miss,\" and he ended up appealing and not missing, but he missed the first four of this most recent season, but -- and I give credit to this analyst, he did his homework. It's just like, \"Look, you have a bunch of Buffalo Wild Wings locations in New England. The star quarterback of the home team is going to miss the first four games. Are you factoring that?\" Legit question.\n\nMoser: I guess my question here is, Oregon is with Under Armour, too.\n\nHill: Wait a minute, Oregon? No, that's a Nike --\n\nMoser: Is Oregon Nike? OK. I was just thinking, I saw something, I was looking at this headline, Oregon Signs Record-Breaking Apparel Deal With Under Armour, and --\n\nHill: Are you sure it's not Oregon State?\n\nMoser: No, it says Oregon.\n\nHill: Because University of Oregon is Phil Knight's alma mater.\n\nMuckerman: Their football field is Nike sole turf.\n\nMoser: I'm aware! Let's go in and confirm this, but this is back from 2014, but Oregon signs record-breaking apparel deal with Under Armour. The deal was announced just hours after Phil Knight announced he would no longer allow Nike to be associated with Oregon, citing his frustration with a lack of national championships.\n\nMuckerman: This isn't The Onion?\n\nMoser: No, this is SB Nation. [laughs] I guess Phil Knight got sick of a bunch of losers! And he decided to bag it. If that's the case, how interesting that you would then have two representatives of Under Armour and two of Nike.\n\nMuckerman: So, Gonzaga and Carolina obviously --\n\nMoser: Carolina is Nike, and I think Gonzaga is too. Oregon is the one I was questioning, because South Carolina is definitely Under Armour, and I think Oregon is, too.\n\nMuckerman: Michael Jordan hasn't eschewed Carolina just yet, I guess.\n\nMoser: That's pretty cool.\n\nHill: Yes. And the University of Oregon women's team is in the regional final that's being played tonight. They're playing UConn.\n\nMuckerman: I'm so sorry for them.\n\nMoser: Right, I was going to say, why don't they just hand them the trophy? It's Connecticut, can they really ...\n\nHill: You know what? That's what amazing Cinderella stories are made out of.\n\nMoser: At some point, everybody thought Kentucky was going to win, but Wisconsin, was it Wisconsin?\n\nHill: Yeah, back in the day, a couple years ago. Look, if Goliath was undefeated, where's the fun in that? We need David to knock off Goliath every once in awhile. So who knows? The lady Ducks might get it done against UConn.\n\nMuckerman: Lady Ducks and the Gamecocks.\n\nHill: That's your lead story, by the way, if the UConn women don't end up winning the national championship. All right, Jason Moser, Taylor Muckerman thanks for being here, guys.\n\nMuckerman: Cheers!\n\n\n\nMoser: Thank you!\n\nHill: As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. That's going to do it for this edition of Market Foolery. The show is mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Chris Hill.

The company says this employee is Anthony Levandowski.\n\nAnthony Levandowski is the founder of Otto. Otto is a self-driving car startup that was created in 2016. Uber bought this startup in 2016 and added Levandowski to its team. Levandowski was a previous employee of the GOOGL car company before founding Otto.\n\nAccording to Waymo, Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential and proprietary design files for its hardware systems six weeks before resigning from the GOOGL company. Among those files were the company’s design data for its LiDAR system.\n\nWaymo says that it has decided to file a lawsuit against Uber after receiving an email from one of its suppliers. The supplier makes parts for the GOOGL company’s LiDAR system. In the email was a picture of a circuit board for Uber’s own LiDAR technology. Waymo says this circuit board looked incredibly like the one it created for its own LiDAR system.\n\nWaymo says that after conducting some research, it has discovered that other former employees also downloaded confidential information from the company. These employees now work for Uber and Otto. The GOOGL company claims this was an organized act to steal its trade secrets and intellectual property.\n\nWaymo also claims that Anthony Levandowski expressed his desire to “replicate” the company’s technology as a rival. It claims he told employees of this plan months before his retirement.", "A man arrives at the Uber offices in Queens, New York, U.S., February 2, 2017.

REUTERS/Alexandria Sage/File Photo\n\nSAN FRANCISCO Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Waymo self-driving car unit sued Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] and its autonomous trucking subsidiary Otto on Thursday over allegations of theft of its confidential and proprietary sensor technology.\n\nWaymo accused Uber and Otto, acquired by the ride services company in August, with stealing confidential information on Waymo's Lidar sensor technology to help speed its own efforts in autonomous technology.\n\n\"Uber's LiDAR technology is actually Waymo's LiDAR technology,\" said Waymo's complaint in the Northern District of California.\n\nUber said it took \"the allegations made against Otto and Uber employees seriously and we will review this matter carefully.\"\n\nLidar, which uses light pulses reflected off objects to gauge their position on or near the road, is a crucial component of autonomous driving systems. Previous systems have been prohibitively expensive and Waymo sought to design one over 90 percent cheaper, making its Lidar technology among the company's \"most valuable assets,\" Waymo said.\n\nWaymo is seeking an unspecified amount of damages and a court order preventing Uber from using its proprietary information.\n\nOtto launched with much fanfare in May, due in part to the high profile of one of its co-founders, Anthony Levandowski, who had been an executive on Google's self-driving project. Uber acquired the company in August for what Waymo said in the lawsuit was $680 million.\n\nWaymo said that before Levandowski's resignation in January 2016 from Google, whose self-driving unit was renamed Waymo in December, he downloaded over 14,000 confidential files, including Lidar circuit board designs, thereby allowing Uber and Otto to fast-track its self-driving technology.\n\nWaymo accused Levandowski of attempting to \"erase any forensic fingerprints\" via a reformat of his laptop.\n\n\"While Waymo developed its custom LiDAR systems with sustained effort over many years, defendants leveraged stolen information to shortcut the process and purportedly build a comparable LiDAR system in only nine months,\" the complaint said.\n\nLast month, Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) electric car company sued the former head of its Autopilot system. It said he tried to recruit Tesla engineers for his new venture with the former head of Google's self-driving programme while still working there, and said he stole proprietary data belonging to Tesla.\n\nWaymo's lawsuit said it learned of this use of trade secrets and patent infringement after it was inadvertently copied on an email from a component vendor that included a design of Uber's Lidar circuit board, which bore a \"striking resemblance\" to Waymo's design.\n\nWaymo noted that Google devoted over seven years to self-driving cars and said Uber's forays into the technology through a partnership with Carnegie Mellon University had stalled by early 2016.\n\n(Reporting by Alexandria Sage; editing by Grant McCool)", "Google parent Alphabet Inc. is suing Uber for allegedly stealing trade secrets from Alphabet's self-driving company, Waymo, to jump-start its own autonomous vehicle program.

Without the need for human intervention, it could cost-effectively offer ad space to advertisers with the click of a button (and payment, of course). This did wonders for GOOGL stock.\n\nThere does come a time, however, when a “hands off” approach to … well, pretty much everything can cause problems.\n\nAlphabet stock holders were made well aware of that reality just last week when a couple of advertisers suspended their ad spending at YouTube when it was realized their advertisements prefaced some distasteful hate speech that surfaced at the popular online video venue.\n\nIn its defense, the company didn’t know. As was noted, ad placements are essentially automated. On the other hand, it’s arguable to say GOOGL should have known something like that could happen, and prevention measures should have been put in place. The debacle may force Alphabet to operate its advertising service with at least a little more human involvement.\n\nA Big Mistake for GOOGL Stock?\n\nAlthough several companies pulled the plug on their YouTube ads, AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) were a couple of the bigger names that called it quits … at least for the time being.\n\nThere was no specific event that prompted the boycotts, nor is it a brand new realization. But, the matter had been boiling over for a couple of weeks now, with an anti-Semitic clip video called “Jewish World Order” serving as the poster child of how vile the digital video venue can be, and how damning the power of association can be to a brand.\n\nIt’s theoretically not supposed to happen. Aside from the fact that ads are intended to be targeted to a plausible potential customer, but knowing that automated filters aren’t perfect, human judgment can also play a role in determining the appropriateness of an ad placement. Still, that’s clearly not working either.\n\nAlphabet responded:\n\n“We don’t comment on individual customers but as announced, we’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear. We’re also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.”\n\nIt’s the right thing to do, but a little too late.\n\nImpact on Alphabet Stock\n\nAnd it’s not just an embarrassing gaffe that will blow over, as most do. Nomura Instinet believes the advertiser boycott will shave $750 million off of the company’s top line over the course of the remainder of 2017.\n\nThat, however, isn’t much in the grand scheme of things.\n\nYouTube was projected to drive $7.7 billion in revenue for that three-quarter stretch. Alphabet has done $90.3 billion in revenue for the last four quarters. Of course, inasmuch as YouTube isn’t profitable, the impact on the per-share profits of GOOGL stock may be nil.\n\nNext Page", "The advertiser issues at YouTube are mounting, but the long-term investment thesis on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) isn't impacted one bit. The short-term issue is becoming increasingly murky though.\n\nThe stock has lost about $40 per share from the all-time high as advertisers flee the platform. Should investors snap up the stock on this sell off or wait for a bigger dip?\n\nThe Wall Street Journal detailed on Friday afternoon how the issue at YouTube was not improving. A journalist was able to detail that brand ads were played on up to 20 videos deemed highly offensive and even racist causing more brands to pull ads.\n\nRBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimated that YouTube was on pace to generate $18.8 billion in ad revenues this year. The amount is less than 20% of the $106.3 billion forecast for the whole company.\n\nHis original forecast of a $300 million revenue impact probably wasn't a problem for the stock, but the follow up forecast of a $1 billion hit is problematic. Whether or not one expects YouTube to solve the problem soon doesn't change the mindset of the market to shoot first and spend a lot of time asking questions.\n\nUltimately though, advertisers need the teen audience of YouTube. A eMarketer graph highlights how the teen audience up to 17 years old is highly focused on Google properties with YouTube being the prime website for teen users.\n\nRemember that this crowd is highly valued and the prime reason that Snap (NYSE:SNAP) recently went public with a market valuation that tops $30 billion. The primary service of Snapchat doesn't even match the reach of YouTube and hasn't grown much since this poll was conducted at the end of September.\n\nThis issue with ads showing on objectionable videos doesn't alter the viewership though. People watching those videos will continue watching them and the desirable teen audience wasn't likely watching those videos anyway. YouTube just needs to steer the ads for the likes of Pepsi (NYSE:PEP) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) to the kid friendly content.\n\nThe process seems simple enough to solve. Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt claims problems exist with the algorithm technology accurately flagging some racist videos, but YouTube should be able to implement a brand friendly category for content creators. Basically, if content creators want the big ad dollars, you must qualify and abide by basic guidelines. The company can run the software against new video uploads and require an editor review those flagged. Anybody failing to abide by the rules in the program has ads blocked.\n\nOne can easily predict the outcome here. YouTube solves the problem and brands find advertising on the platform even more compelling than before. Until then, situations that get worse on second review tend to have lasting impacts. Not to mention, some of the statements by Eric Schmidt seem to suggest Google is too interested in lowering the ranking of the videos versus blocking ads on them that really don't solve the concerns of the brand advertisers.\n\nA $1 billion hit to revenues over the next couple of quarters while Alphabet solves this problem is meaningful. A $500 million hit to Q2 revenues reduces the growth rate to 15.8%. Revenues are targeted at $25.4 billion now, up from $21.5 billion last year. Each $500 million hit reduces the growth rate by 230 basis points so one can quickly see on the growth rate quickly unravels.\n\nThe key investor takeaway is that Alphabet via YouTube controls the much wanted access to teens. The company will ultimately work with brand advertisers to find a workable solution, though some signs exist that a disconnect exists.\n\nThe stock will struggle in the meantime, but this issue doesn't ultimately change the path to $1,000. Don't get too negative on Alphabet, but an opportunity to own the stock might exist down at $800 for those that don't own the stock yet.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

This realization is coming from someone who has, for more than a decade, been very reliant on Google products and services in his daily life! With the share price of Alphabet falling every day since the announcement of the Q4 2016 results, before recovering only slightly in February, it gives potential investors an opportunity to digest the earnings and evaluate the investment thesis.\n\nFor a loyal user and someone who is long on the share, please forgive me for brushing off the minor miss of $0.26 when the company achieved an EPS of $9.36, which was a 8% year-on-year increase. Furthermore, the revenue side was a beat, albeit a minor one, at a 22.2% growth over the same period a year ago.\n\nWhile Apple is not the best company to compare with Alphabet (which company can be used for an apples-to-apples comparison?), I have used it as a reference in generating the P/E ratio chart (below). You would see that Alphabet has been trading in a narrow P/E band since July 2014, apart from certain periods such as 2H 2015, when the P/E shot up above 35. Normalized P/E is now at 28, far from the peak in late 2015. On the contrary, Apple's P/E has been on the rise since July 2016 and is at its highest since mid-2015. Hence, from a P/E perspective, Apple might be giving potential investors the feeling that they have missed the bottom. The opposite is true for Alphabet, where for a good part of mid-2015 to Q3 2016, the P/E was higher than it presently is.\n\n(Source: Seeking Alpha)\n\nGOOG Normalized PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nThe improvement in Free Cash Flow ($1.828 billion, or 41%, higher yoy) is better represented in the Price-to-FCF chart ((below)). Despite the current share price being higher than that in end 2015, the Price-to-FCF has declined substantially to 22. Again, the comparison with Apple is to give some color (both literally and figuratively) to the graph and not to disparage Apple, which I am also long.\n\nGOOG Price to Free Cash Flow (Annual) data by YCharts\n\nHow Pervasive is Alphabet?\n\nAfter a background on the company's recent results and notable fundamentals, I would like to get to the main motivation of this article, which is to highlight the increasing pervasiveness of Alphabet in our daily life. In addition, that pervasiveness has translated to higher advertisement penetration. Much has been said about Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) video ambitions and the resultant chase for advertisement dollars. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Snapchat (CHAT) have also thrown their hats in the ring. However, Alphabet's YouTube is still the ultimate king of videos and the unrivaled depository of user-created content by far, helped in large part by its headstart. In a leaked report from premium publisher trade body Digital Content Next (DCN), premium publishing companies generated half their syndication revenue from YouTube and the other half from all the others put together.\n\n(Source: Business Insider)\n\nYouTube has continually found new ways to increase advertisement placement in its streaming videos, and it's not isolated to the desktop. Google has gotten better at monetizing on the mobile front. On both platforms, you would see video ads at the beginning of videos, or several times for a long video. There could also be text links to sponsors appearing. It used to be just me watching the videos, but now my kids are also avid watchers of cartoons on YouTube. There would be two types of advertisers who target videos meant for children's consumption. One group intends to attract the children watching the videos themselves - the group would comprise toy makers, for instance. The other group, interestingly, assumes that the adults would be accompanying the kids, or at least in close enough proximity where the advertisers could attract with video ads appealing to the adults. Thus, even at those times when I wanted to rest my mind by leaving the kids to the care of YouTube, the advertisers, with Google as their accomplice, managed to capture my attention with engaging advertisements.\n\n(Source: YouTube)\n\nFor you avid readers of Seeking Alpha, did you know that the advertisements placed on the left, right and bottom of every article are generated by Google? Hover your cursor over the advertisements, and you will notice it's either directing to googleadservices.com or doubleclick.net. DoubleClick, incidentally, is also a subsidiary of Google.\n\nThanks to the very useful flash news alert function of Seeking Alpha, I came to know the following development about the parent company of Snapchat, the popular messaging app, especially with millennials.\n\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP), newly-filed for public offering, has engineered its technology primarily around computing, storage, bandwidth and other offerings supplied by Google, indicating a gainful arrangement for Alphabet for the coming five-year period and prospectively beyond. - Seeking Alpha News Editor Eric McCaffrey\n\nSo, if you have been using Snapchat, do note that the parent company of the app has committed $2 billion to Google Cloud over the next five years, and likely beyond that, if Snap survives that long in the first place. How many users of Snapchat actually know the level of reliance of the company on Google? Looking at it from another angle, how many investors, analysts and observers of Alphabet knew before the news broke out that Google is a beneficiary of the rise of Snapchat? While the advent and success of Snapchat have been a significant threat to Google's competitors like Facebook and its affiliated Messenger as well as WhatsApp, the threat to Google in the form of Hangouts is negligible, since it is not considered to be a major contender in the messaging space. Yet, Google's other businesses, such as Google Cloud, have been benefiting from the increasing popularity of Snapchat. Snap has also been suspected to be Google Cloud's largest customer.\n\nSeeking Alpha News also reported on January 17 that Nest Learning Thermostats, Nest Protects and Nest Cams are installed across more than 190 countries. These Nest products are part of the offerings by Nest Labs, which was fully acquired by Google in February 2014. Outside of homes, soon a self-driving car near you might be using an autonomous-driving technology developed by Alphabet's Waymo, formerly known as the Google self-driving car project.\n\nOther Google services that I have found myself using extensively include Gmail, Google Calendar, Google News, Google Alerts, Google Keep, Google Maps, Google Drive and, last but not least, my Android phone. A few years back, when I was running an online business, Google Adsense and Google AdWords served as two very useful tools in earning some supplementary income and low-cost targeted marketing respectively. It would be nice if readers would leave in the comments section what are the top few Google products and services they are using most extensively. I believe I am not the only person who is heavily reliant on Google every day.\n\nGoogle's AI start-up DeepMind was also in the news recently for defeating top poker players, after its success over human Go masters.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlphabet's wide-spreading tentacles are ensuring that its products and services are increasingly becoming more pervasive in our daily life. Consequently, there are apparently many other avenues where Alphabet, or at least Google as we know it, could insert advertisements. For instance, the most obvious place is Google's main search page (before the results), though the founders, Sergey and Larry, had sworn they would never have advertisements on that homepage. Yet, the company has already done so for its own products and services. Perhaps they should have clarified themselves then by adding \"paid\" to their statement. Another extensively used product, Gmail, has also been void of advertisement. This has been done so in the spirit of reducing clutter and improving adoption. However, I believe many long-time users of Google products and services wouldn't mind one or several placements if we have more complimentary storage space in return. Similarly, many of the other services, such as Google Alerts, Google Keep, Google Drive and Google News, are currently void of advertisements.\n\nIndividually, each of the Google services might not be the best available, but the convenience of a single login to access most of the services that I require outweighs the benefits of the leading alternatives. Hence, there remains huge potential for Alphabet to monetize its offerings through increasing ads placements.\n\nThe success of Snap would serve as Google Cloud's best testimonial, which would help the business segment to attract more customers. The proliferation of Nest products at home and in the office as well as Waymo technology in self-driving cars would mean we would come into contact with Alphabet-related physical products more often than ever. Alphabet's \"other bets,\" such as DeepMind, are areas of yet-to-be-tapped opportunities which the company could develop for revenue-generating activities. The more pervasive Alphabet has become in your life, the more reasons it is giving you to own it.\n\nNote from author: Thank you for reading.

(NYSE: TIF ).\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nAlphabet Inc (GOOG, GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet has been ordered to surrender emails outside the U.S. by a federal agency.\n\nThe tech company has received an FBI warrant that U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Rueter signed. The judge said the move would not be considered to be a seizure.\n\n\"Though the retrieval of the electronic data by Google from its multiple data centers abroad has the potential for an invasion of privacy, the actual infringement of privacy occurs at the time of disclosure in the United States,\" Rueter said.\n\nIt is still unclear whether or not the ruling will stand as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) faced a similar situation in which a judge ruled against emails being handed over.\n\nGOOG stock is up 3.8% year-to-date, while GOOGL shares are up 3.5% YTD.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Co (KO)\n\nCoca-Cola released a Super Bowl ad that appears to have backfired.\n\nThe commercial was a rerun of an ad that was released in 2014, featuring \"America the Beautiful\" which was written by Katharine Lee Bates. The new version of it has the song performed in numerous languages.\n\nIn order to promote diversity, the song is performed in English, Spanish, Keres, Tagalog, Hindi, Senegalese, French and Hebrew. The video shows a diverse group of people.\n\nWhile the company was attempting to send a message in support of people of all creed, many criticized it as it appeared to simply be a commercial using diversity to sell the product.\n\nThe hashtag #BoycottCoke soon followed on Twitter. Meanwhile, others supported the ad and criticized those who chose to see the commercial purely for advertising purposes.\n\nKO shares are down 4.5% over the last six months.\n\nTiffany & Co. (TIF)\n\nThe Tiffany CEO has stepped down as boss.\n\nThe news came as the company announced that its upcoming earnings call will reveal disappointing results. Previous CEO Michael Kowalski will serve as the new boss on an interim basis.\n\nKowalski said the company will continue to focus on \"enhancing the customer experience, increasing the rate of new product introductions and innovation, maximizing marketing effectiveness, … all while efficiently managing our capital and costs.\"\n\nLower consuming spending resulted in lower sales that hampered the company's results.\n\nTIF shares fell 3.9% year-to-date.\n\nAs of this writing, Karl Utermohlen did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post 3 Stocks to Watch on Monday: Alphabet Inc (GOOG, GOOGL), The Coca-Cola Co (KO) and Tiffany & Co.

(GOOGL) Waymo Spinoff Could Make or Mar Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)" ], "article_text" : [ "Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google self-driving car project is no longer just a project. Starting today, the tech company's self-driving car efforts have graduated from the Google X research unit, as one of Alphabet's \"moonshots,\" to an official Alphabet business called Waymo.\n\n\"Waymo stands for a new way forward in mobility. We're a self-driving technology company with a mission to make it safe and easy for people and things to move around,\" Waymo said in a blog post on Tuesday.\n\nAlphabet's launch of Waymo comes nearly eight years after the company began working on self-driving cars, but it enters what is quickly turning into a fiercely competitive market as Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) asserts it is already including self-driving sensors in every vehicle and as other auto manufacturers, tech companies, and ride-hailing services explore ways to monetize the nascent technology.\n\nMeet Waymo\n\nWaymo was careful to emphasize that this is not the beginning of Alphabet's efforts in this important space, but rather the culmination of years of work.\n\n\"Waymo may be a new company, but we're building on advanced self-driving technology developed over many years at Google,\" said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in the company's blog post.\n\nAlphabet knew it was time for Waymo to begin the process of becoming its own company when the former Google X project completed \"the world's first fully self driven car ride\" in late 2015, Krafcik said. Navigating through Austin's suburbs with legally blind passenger Steve Mahan, Alphabet says the drive reflected everyday driving situations.\n\nMahan explained the importance of this milestone:\n\nThe ability to complete a fully self-driven trip on everyday public roads, with no test driver, was a big milestone for our team and the history of this technology. It was the signal that we could begin to shift our focus from foundational technical work toward launching our own company so we can offer many more rides, in more places, for more people.\n\nSelf-driving technology -- not self-driving cars\n\nInterestingly, in conjunction with the announcement of Waymo today, Alphabet is reportedly backing off any plans to manufacture and sell its own self-driving cars, opting instead to partner with auto manufacturers in order to deploy the technology, according to The Information's Amir Efrati.\n\nAlphabet has backed off plans to develop a revolutionary car without a steering wheel or pedals, at least for now, according to people close to the closely watched project. Instead, the self-driving car pioneer has settled on a more practical effort to partner with automakers to make a vehicle that drives itself but has traditional features for human drivers.\n\nAnd a comment from Waymo's Krafcik during a press conference on Tuesday seems to confirm the new company's choice to abstain from auto manufacturing for now. \"We've been really clear that we're not a car company,\" Krafcik said (via The New York Times). \"We're not in the business of making better cars. We're in the business of making better drivers.\"\n\nAlphabet's decision to refrain from manufacturing its own self-driving vehicles differs from Tesla's emphasis on both the self-driving technology and the manufacturing of self-driving vehicles and it means Tesla doesn't have to worry about the technology giant becoming a direct competitor -- for now. However, it's worth noting it was never certain Alphabet ever intended on manufacturing its own vehicles in the first place.\n\nGiven how competitive and capital intensive the auto market is, focusing solely on the self-driving technology may arguably be the better move for software-centric Alphabet's Waymo. Indeed, Waymo isn't the only major company to acknowledge the challenge ambitious manufacturing plans could bring about. By focusing on the autonomous driving software instead of building self-driving cars, Alphabet's Waymo vision mimics a recent report that Apple has also shifted its focus from building its own self-driving car to emphasizing the development of the underlying technology for autonomous driving.", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs Waymo becomes part of the Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) family of companies, most analysts are asking when or whether it will contribute to GOOG stock's bottom line.\n\nSource: Brionv via Wikimedia (Modified)\n\nThe launch event on Dec. 13 featured a blind man given a ride around Austin, Texas in a car without a steering wheel, and vague discussion of how the project's 2 million miles of self-driving experience could be put to work in ride sharing, trucking or public transport.\n\nWhile previous GOOG projects like Nest, the automated home company, and Google Fiber, the phone company competitor, quickly floundered as their teams tried to change the world, the car company Waymo seems interested in getting paid for helping others change the world.\n\nIt's an important distinction. Google X, the unit into which CFO Ruth Porat put CEO Larry Page's \"moonshots\" in technology unrelated to the search engine, is now expected to turn into a real company or go away.\n\nA Real Market for GOOG\n\nThe new Waymo is being run by a car guy, former Hyundai USA President John Krafcik, leaving the experimental team under Chris Urmson by the side of the road. Urmson is launching his own startup.\n\nKrafcik is building a team of experienced auto executives, and representing the company in the press, dealing with the fallout from a Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) driver dying with the car in a self-driving mode, the opening of a Waymo design office in Detroit and initial questions of government regulation.\n\nThese are practical questions previous Alphabet launches tended to ignore. They also tended to ignore whether the opportunity before them was real or in their heads.\n\nIn the case of Waymo, it's clear there is a real market. Boston Consulting Group estimates it at $42 billion in software and services within 10 years, others say $560 billion in sales within 20 .\n\nThis has attracted real competition, not just from Tesla but from Uber, General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) and start-ups like nuTonomy .\n\nThe question for Krafcik is not whether Waymo can knock off these other companies, but where Waymo's experience, software and hardware packages can fit into their plans.\n\nDeliberately Undefined\n\nKrafcik is leaving that deliberately undefined. The company has sold Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE: FCAU ) on a package that will make 100 of its minivans self-driving members of the Waymo fleet.\n\nBut there are other assets Krafcik can capitalize on, and technical hurdles to be overcome along the way. The lidar \"bucket\" on top of current Google cars costs too much, for instance. The problems of scaling the solution are real ones. Getting the public, politicians and the insurance industry to accept self-driving as a concept is going to be a huge job for the company.\n\nWaymo needs to bring in enough cash from what it has already done to fund research into these more specialized areas.\n\nFor now, Krafcik plans to make Waymo an enabling technology, leaving the heavy capital lifting to others, and making his own efforts self-sustaining.\n\nThe Bottom Line on GOOG Stock\n\nThis modest approach will free corporate assets to keep investing in software, in cloud data centers, and in device hardware, which is where CFO Ruth Porat wants the company to be.\n\nIt should also satisfy shareholders. If Waymo can break even going forward, it will leave GOOG stock's 29.3 price-to-earnings multiple and $554 billion in market cap alone.\n\nSince Porat became CFO for what is now Alphabet in June, 2015, GOOG stock is up 49%, the bottom line growing 20% while the top line has grown 10%; it has kept its operating margins at about 25%, and the company will announce revenues of well over $80 billion for the year when it reports 2016 on Jan. 26.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Breaking news holds that Alphabet has spun off its Google self-driving unit into a standalone bet under Alphabet’s umbrella. Google’s self-driving unit is now a standalone firm called Waymo. Don’t take offense with Google’s penchant for poor naming choices, Waymo means “a new Way forward in Mobility.”\n\nThe Waymo spinoff suggests that Google is now about to pursue ways to monetize its self-driving tech after spending 7 years in R&D. John Krafcik, who left Hyundai to join Google is the CEO of Waymo. Krafcik is also working with Shaun Stewart who held executive position at TripAdvisor before joining Google.\n\nWaymo is not a car company\n\nDespite the fact that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google was at the forefront of building self-driving cars, Waymo is not setting up shop as a car company. The firm notes that it is looking forward to licensing/selling its self-driving tech to automakers. The firm would also work with players in other industries such as ridesharing, trucking, logistics and public transport where self-driving tech could make a difference.\n\nIn Krafcik’s words, “We are a self driving technology company… We’ve been really clear that we’re not a car company although there’s been some confusion on that point. We’re not in the business of making better cars. We’re in the business of making better drivers.”\n\nWaymo’s focus on software is similar to Apple’s recent move to scale down its Apple Car Project Titan to focus on car OS instead of building cars. However, Google and Apple’s move to scale down from hardware and to focus on software might make or mar Tesla Motors Inc Autopilot tech in the grand scheme of things.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here\n\nHere’s how Waymo might hurt Tesla\n\nTesla might lose its near-monopoly of Level 5 self-driving tech if Waymo and Apple succeed in the plan to license self-driving tech to carmakers. In fact, Tesla’s Autopilot would be like the iPhone of cars on the one side because Musk controls both the hardware and software of the cars. On the other hand, Waymo will turn out to be the “Android” of self-driving cars because just about every carmaker will build a self-driving car on Waymo in the same way that any tech firm could build a smartphone on Android.\n\nHere’s How Waymo might help Tesla suceed\n\nTesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)might succeed by building an exclusive, premium, and elitist self-driving car brand if Waymo licenses its self-driving tech to every carmaker that comes asking. Tesla’s tight control over hardware and software could make its car more appealing to buyers who want privacy and ads-free commute.\n\nIf the situation with Android OS on smartphone replays itself with “Waymo OS” for self-driving cars, you should be ready to endure ads on your commute (possibly on the windshield) among other evils that Google is not. More so, each of the carmakers that licenses Waymo’s self-driving tech will personalize the tech to look different from rival offerings. Hence, Waymo-powered self-driving cars are likely to become a confusing bunch in an attempt to be unique." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.2226750588592694, 0.1516934046345811, 0.02677128427128427 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.5531802992329308, 0.418716577540107, 0.4658761724386725 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-14T00:00:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2016-12-15T14:32:23.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2016-12-14T07:59:42.000+0000" } ] }

But I've owned shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) -- formerly known as Google -- for almost a decade, and I can't fathom a circumstance under which I'd consider parting with my shares.\n\nCurrently, shares of the company make up a whopping 13% of my family's real-life stock holdings. But we're totally comfortable with that allocation.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. The company's flagship product has a dominant market (and mind) share\n\nIf you're sitting around the dinner table arguing about a provable fact, you resolve the dispute by simply \"Googling\" the answer. The fact that the name is so embedded in our lexicon speaks volumes to the search engine's dominance.\n\nAccording to Statista, Alphabet's Google search owns 90.4% of the global market on desktops. And perhaps more important, according to NetMarketShare, it commands 93.8% of the mobile search market share globally.\n\n2. It boasts six other products with over 1 billion users\n\nBut as you're probably well aware, Google is much more than just search. It has six other applications with over 1 billion users. These include Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, Chrome, Android, and Google Play Store.\n\n3. That all adds up to a lot of data\n\n\"Sure,\" you might say, \"but the company doesn't charge for most of those products. That's not great business.\"\n\nWhile you'd be right, you'd be missing out on what's dubbed the \"oil of the information age\": data. With every user in all seven of those aforementioned apps, the company is able to collect gobs of data. In fact, I don't think it would be too hard to argue that Google has more data on the people walking this earth than any other organization, at any other time in human history.\n\n4. At its heart, it is still an advertising company\n\nThat data is worth billions to advertisers. In the old days, companies would try to target their audience by putting ads in magazines or newspapers where potential customers might be lurking. But the feedback loop wasn't great: Advertisers never knew just how effective that ad spending was.\n\nNot so anymore. With Google's advertising platform, companies get real-time feedback on how efficiently their ads are being placed, and how much business they produce. Given the data hoard that the company has, ads placed through Google can be more targeted to the perfect customer than any other available source. That's a huge moat for the company.\n\nIt also helps explain why Google advertising brought in $67 billion in sales last year for the company, or 90% of all revenue.\n\n5. Digital ads are poised to grow\n\nIf you think you've missed the boat, rest assured you haven't. A March 2016 report from eMarketer shows that there's still a lot of room for internet advertising to grow.\n\nAnd with TV still retaining one-third of the global market share in 2019, I can only imagine that the runway for internet ad growth will continue for much of the next decade.\n\n6. The company is more than a one-trick pony\n\nBack to that name change, from \"Google\" to \"Alphabet.\" You might better understand the reasoning if you look at the new corporate name as \"Alpha-Bet.\" This rendering of the name reflects the company's practice of taking a lot of moonshot bets on revolutionary technologies outside its main search and data-capturing business.\n\nThis is what famed trader, academic, and thinker Nassim Taleb would call a barbell approach: having a large a reliable stream of revenue on one side while taking lots of small bets on the other. While the likelihood of any one moonshot succeeding is small, all it will take is one or two winners over the next decade to make a meaningful difference for shareholders.\n\nWhat are these moonshots? We probably don't know all of them, but the ones we do include self-driving cars, a connected home, a life sciences company, and lightning-fast internet connection.\n\n7. Its mission statement is memorable\n\nI'm a sucker for a good mission statement. When it is clear and powerful, it can be the compass that helps guide management and employees alike toward a common goal.\n\nGoogle's mission statement is: \"To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.\"\n\nThe mission of new-formed parent company Alphabet is multifaceted but can be broken down to: \"Getting more ambitious things done[,] ... empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish ... [and] as a result of all this, improving the lives of as many people as we can.\"\n\nThose are both powerful and flexible enough objectives to keep the company relevant in a quickly changing world.\n\n8. It has soul in the game\n\nLest you think that you might have a few executives who are in this for short-term gain, Alphabet is still run by its co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Together, they -- along with all of the other company executives and board members -- own almost 48 million shares of Alphabet, and account for 60% of the company's voting power. To put the number of shares in perspective, it is equivalent to almost $40 billion at today's prices.\n\n9. The proof is in the culture\n\nAnother metric that's often overlooked is a company's culture. If Page and Brin really do want to accomplish the ambitious goals they've laid out, they need a stable and motivated workforce to get things done.\n\nTo get an idea for the company's approach, a 2010 filing with the SEC stated that \"[monetary] incentives are secondary to career growth, work environment, and engaging work opportunities. We seek to develop a highly motivated and collaborative workforce that pursues achievements for the sake of progress and innovation before individual gain.\"\n\nBased on employee reviews on Glassdoor.com, I'd say the company is doing pretty well.\n\n10. There is lots of cash to make it work\n\nFinally, if you've got a company that's going to be taking lots of small bets that can be costly, it's good to know that management is sitting on a pretty expansive war chest. And that's what you get with Alphabet.\n\nLong-term debt: $3.9 billion\n\nCash, short-, and long-term investments: $88.8 billion\n\nThis, and the other nine reasons above, helps me sleep well at night knowing my family is invested in -- and likely won't sell for a long time -- such a company.", "Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is a stock that’s boring, until it’s not. In 2012, GOOG stock went up by single digits but then in 2013 it gained almost 60%. Then in 2014, what was then Google stock lost about 3% before gaining another 44% again in 2015 after changing its name to Alphabet along the way.\n\nIn 2016, Alphabet Inc. was up by about 8% to lag the overall stock market. So will the past trend hold, and will 2017 be a breakout year?\n\nThere are fair arguments on both sides. After all, the high-growth days of Google are behind it after the internet giant has matured to a nearly $600 billion company. Also, rival Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) is now its peer in both its reach and its relationship with digital advertisers. On the other hand, bulls who like GOOG stock or GOOGL like its track record of consistent growth and innovation over the years.\n\nSo who’s right? Here’s a look at both sides of the trade with three pros and three cons to investing in Alphabet stock right now.\n\nPros of GOOG Stock\n\nGrowth: While the company restructured into Alphabet in 2015, Google advertising remains the biggest part of its business. And that business is good, judging by overall revenue growth of 19% this year and a projected 16% growth rate next year. Furthermore, profits will be up 16% this year and 19% next year. With continued success from its core, Alphabet can afford to look into new efforts without worrying about financial performance.\n\nValuation: Despite a strong history of success and projections of future growth, GOOG stock is not overvalued. Right now, shares trade for around 20 times forward earnings. That is on par with forward P/E of about 19 for the typical stock in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. If you can get a fair price for a high-growth company like this, you should take it.\n\nInnovation: With a fair current price and hopes of future growth, there’s a lot to like about Alphabet Inc. right now. But with constant innovation into new areas, including a “smart” contact lens that can read your blood sugar or Google Fiber high-speed internet access, there is a whole lot of future potential from GOOG stock.\n\nTo keep reading and get 3 reasons to steer clear of Alphabet stock, click here or use the navigation below.", "Following its 2017 Proprietary Ad Survey, Cowen raised its price targets for Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Criteo SA (ADR) (NASDAQ: CRTO).\n\nPositive Implications Seen For Criteo\n\nAnalysts Thomas Champion, John Blackledge and Nick Yako said they see positive implications for Criteo, including meaningful digital dollars moving toward programmatic \"targeting\" as an attribute is in demand and plenty of room for customer growth.\n\nCowen also updated its model for the HookLogic acquisition and search product introduction. Assuming revenue contribution of $55 million (excluding traffic acquisition costs) and $7 million for search in 2017, the firm expects revenues of $940 million for the company in 2017, representing 31 percent year-over-year growth. Based on the introduction of its new quarterly estimates, Cowen raised its price target for the shares of the company.\n\nGoogle Remains Dominant Franchise\n\nWhile noting that search remains the single largest category of spend within digital, Cowen said respondents see Google's search offers the highest return on investment. The firm also feels Google is well positioned in video, with daily viewership in the hundreds of millions of hours and more than 1 billion in monthly average users.\n\nGiven the inclination shown by respondents toward YouTube for new brand campaigns, Cowen said the channel is well positioned for the secular shift to digital video advertising. The firm forecasts gross revenues of $7.7 billion in 2016, increasing to $25.6 billion by 2021. Based on its survey, Cowen also said DoubleClick offers Google pole position in the Programmatic transition.\n\nEstimates For Google\n\nCowen expects net revenues of $85.8 billion for 2017, down from $86.4 billion previously. The firm noted that it has raised its TAC to reflect greater share of search volume on mobile.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2016, Cowen expects Google to report gross revenues of $25.6 billion, up 24 percent year-over-year (23 percent growth for Google own and owned sites, 2 percent for Network and 40 percent growth in other revenue). For other bets, the firm expects revenue growth of 35 percent. The firm's EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share estimates of $10.2 billion and $10.09 are also above the consensus estimate.\n\nFacebook's Social Leadership\n\nCowen's survey revealed that about 75 percent of social spending dollars are allocated to core Facebook and Instagram. Given the respondents pre-occupation with targeting, the firm believes Facebook will benefit from its best user targeting in the market. The percentage of respondents saying they would use Facebook video for a standalone brand campaign has improved to 17 percent from 10 percent last year, Cowen noted.\n\nEstimates For Facebook\n\nCowen raised its Facebook ad revenue forecast for 2017 to $36.6 billion from $35.8 billion and total revenue forecast to $37.3 billion from $36.5 billion, with the company's core Facebook strength, higher video contribution and Instagram keeping the firm above consensus.\n\nRatings/Price Targets\n\nAlphabet: Outperform/price target raised to $1,050 from $1,000.\n\nCriteo: Outperform/price target raised to $55 from $53.\n\nFacebook: Outperform/price target raised to $156 from $150.\n\nLatest Ratings for GOOG Date Firm Action From To Jan 2017 Pacific Crest Reinstates Overweight Jul 2016 JP Morgan Maintains Overweight Apr 2016 Deutsche Bank Maintains Buy View More Analyst Ratings for GOOG\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nPosted-In: Analyst Color Long Ideas News Price Target Reiteration Analyst Ratings Movers Tech Best of Benzinga\n\n© 2017 Benzinga.com.

Whereas one analyst likes Snap’s potential to gear up as an advertising force among a strategic, young demographic, another analyst underscores slight cause for concern with Alphabet’s suddenly shaky tight rope walk amid global brand ad backlash. Let’s take a closer look:\n\nSnap: The Platform Brands Need to Be Advertising On\n\nSnap has divided many analysts on Wall Street since its IPO. Yet, William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart approaches the popular Snapchat app parent company with a bullish first impression, impressed with its “cool” factor among millennials, a bull’s eye from an advertising standpoint, as well as its robust social, video, and mobile ad budget growth prospects. As such, the analyst initiates coverage on SNAP with an Outperform rating without listing a price target.\n\nAs far as Schackart sizes up the new public company, “Snapchat Has What Brand Advertisers Want: Young Users,” elaborating, “By now, most advertisers we speak with know that Snapchat has a strong following among teenagers and millennials, who are becoming increasingly difficult to reach with TV advertisements. […] Given the importance of reaching this younger demographic, many brands see Snapchat as a platform they need to be advertising on.”\n\nConsidering that “Revenue [is] Just Beginning to Ramp Up, [with] Many Growth Drivers Ahead,” the analyst projects that by 2018, Snap could be circling $2 billion in revenue, indicating “a long runway for revenue growth” gleams ahead. “In the near term, we believe the largest contributors to revenue growth will be simply increasing the number of advertising clients and ads served,” continues the analyst.\n\nLastly, checking in with industry participants, Schackart highlights Snap’s competitive potential to steal digital ad dollars from rivals Facebook and Google for those seeking to attain a “viable third option.” With the company in solid standing to capture some of the worldwide TV ad market’s massive $186 billion share, the analyst concludes confidently cheering in Snap’s corner.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, which measures analysts’ and bloggers’ success rate based on how their calls perform, four-star analyst Ralph Schackart is ranked #522 out of 4,555 analysts. Schackart has a 67% success rate and generates an average return of 12.3%. When recommending SNAP, Schackart earns 0.0% in average profits on the stock.\n\nTipRanks analytics demonstrate SNAP as a Hold. Based on 31 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 12 rate a Buy on Snap, 12 maintain a Hold, while 7 issue a Sell on the stock. The 12-month average price target stands at $23.46, marking a nearly 2% downside from where the stock is currently trading.\n\nAlphabet’s Glaring Global Ad Spend Pickle\n\nAlphabet might have some brand image rehab on its hands from the eyes of Nomura analyst Anthony Diclemente, who after touching base with ad buyers has found some of the biggest spenders across the globe are tightening the reigns on YouTube ad spend. There is a rising apprehension from a brand advertising standpoint that brand reputation could be in jeopardy in the mix of appearing side-by-side “highly controversial content which is unsafe for brands.”\n\nOn the heels of YouTube ad campaign pullback, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of GOOGL while cutting the price target from $950 to $925, which represents a 10% increase from current levels. Furthermore, the analyst chops Google revenue and OI growth projections for the year.\n\nDiclemente opines, “While we believe YouTube is indeed capable of introducing solutions that remedy brand safety concerns, we anticipate the direct cumulative negative impact to revenue could ultimately approximate $750mn, weighted heavily to 2Q17 and 3Q17. We also believe the cost of developing a solution may weigh on margins. Of course, investor confidence in YouTube’s ability to take incremental share of TV ad budgets has been reduced to some degree.”\n\nUltimately, “Checks with ad buyers highlight that when concerns over brand safety arise, approach is to ‘pull spend, ask questions later.’ Unfortunately, brand safety risk aversion from company CEO’s and CMO’s can go to extremes in well-publicized cases such as the current YouTube situation. […] ad buyers are likely to demand greater direct control over ad placement, which could take time and resources to implement, in our view,” Diclemente surmises.\n\nAs usual, we like to include the analyst’s track record when reporting on new analyst notes to give a perspective on the effect it has on stock performance. According to TipRanks, five-star analyst Anthony Diclemente is ranked #193 out of 4,555 analysts. Diclemente has a 71% success rate and realizes 11.6% in his annual returns. When recommending GOOGL, Diclemente yields 18.6% in average profits on the stock.\n\nTipRanks analytics exhibit GOOGL as a Strong Buy. Out of 30 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 27 are bullish on Alphabet stock, 2 remain sidelined, and 1 is bearish on the stock. With a return potential of nearly 19%, the consensus target price stands at $996.85." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.0830162794951527 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4659898786659347 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-28T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

(GOOGL) Receives $974.17 Average PT from Brokerages" ], "article_text" : [ "The stock price appreciation is justified by the growth rate of the earnings and intrinsic value.\n\nHistorical Performance\n\nWhen we compare the long-term performance of Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) stock with the performance of the S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY), we can see Alphabet Inc. has strongly outperformed the market index.\n\nSource: StockCharts.com\n\nThe outperformance started already in 2006, and the current stock price momentum is not slowing down its speed. The share price of GOOGL is currently at $834, bringing the total market capitalization value to $567 billion (the second-largest market cap, right after Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)).\n\nPersonally, I have been following Alphabet's stock price performance closely in the previous years. I have bought a few shares in 2015, when the price was around the $550 level, but it always remained a small position in my stock portfolio. The reason why I did this was because I considered the stock price elevated from a technical point of view. The price has been growing strongly almost continuously in the previous years without much of a pullback. As a consequence, this company remained on the watchlist of stocks I would buy if the markets crashed (like in 2008-2009).\n\nThat's not to say I don't believe in the company fundamentally. I use Google daily (everyone I know does), and the companies I worked for are all advertising via the Google website. I strongly believe Google will keep growing its income flow from advertising and will keep increasing its market value. While Alphabet is more than just Google (the advertising business), the strong income from this segment is, for me, the most important reason buy this stock and hold it in my portfolio for many years.\n\nIn the beginning of 2017, I forced myself to take a closer look into the fundamentals of Alphabet, its earnings growth and what can likely be expected in the future from this company and its stock price. I will present a short summary of these results in this article and demonstrate a trade idea to benefit from Google and its future price performance.\n\nFundamentals of Alphabet\n\nThe revenue of Alphabet is currently $90 billion for 2016 (up from $0.4 billion in 2002). Growth in revenues has been realized year after year:\n\n(Source: Statista)\n\nThe bulk of this revenue comes from the advertising business of Alphabet Inc. A question worth asking here is: Will the growth of the advertising business in general continue as well in the coming years?\n\nA recent report from the Internet Advertising Bureau details the quarterly growth in the advertising income since 1996. As can be seen from this chart, income from advertising is still growing strongly. Internet ad revenues increased by 20% in Q3 2016 (year over year).\n\n(Source: Interactive Advertising Bureau)\n\nBeing the most dominant player in the online search market, Google has seen its income increase steadily. We should also keep in mind the other business fields Alphabet is active in, outside of advertising. The company calls this segment \"Other Bets\". While income from this segment is small in comparison to that from the advertising segment, it could become more significant in the future. Shareholders of Alphabet will benefit from successes in this segment as well once the income starts to increase.\n\nIn the table below, Alphabet's fundamentals for the previous years are summarized. I expect these growth rates to continue in the coming years, just as they have been doing since the inception. The stock price of Alphabet is bound to appreciate further with these underlying fundamentals.\n\n(Source: YCharts)\n\nOpportunity: Buy long-term call option on Alphabet\n\nConsidering these points above, we think Alphabet remains a strong investment in 2017 and in the upcoming years. The current P/E ratio of the stock price is 30, which seems reasonable given its current position.\n\nFor this reason, we would suggest initiating a long position in a call option contract on Alphabet. In this way, you can minimize your required investment to benefit from a rise in the underlying stock price. Here we would suggest buying a call option contract expiring on January 19, 2018, with a strike price of $900 (around 8% above the current stock price).\n\n(Source: Nasdaq.com)\n\nThis call option contract gives the holder the right to buy 100 shares of Alphabet for $900 at any time until 19/01/2018. The total cost of the call option contract will be $4,169 ($41.69 per common share).\n\nThe trade has the following benefits:\n\nThe implied volatility of Alphabet is currently low (13%), considering the implied volatility levels it faced in the past. This implied volatility is the main driver of option prices on Alphabet, which means the options are inexpensive at these IV levels. This low volatility can also be seen in the general stock indices, which are currently making new highs.\n\n(Source: Optionistics)\n\nThe profit potential is highly leveraged compared to a simple purchase of Alphabet common stocks. In the graph below, we compare the profit profile of the call options with the profit profile of common GOOGL stocks:\n\n(Source: Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe expiration of the call options is on 19th January, 2018, giving the stock price of Alphabet time to increase in value.\n\nThe risk of this option investment is limited to the debit amount paid for the call options. A purchase of 100 GOOGL stocks would currently cost $83,400. This call option contract only costs $4,169 and will also give you upward potential from appreciation in the stock price of GOOGL.\n\nThe main disadvantage of this call option investment (compared to an investment in the common stock) is the timing. If the common stock declines in the upcoming months, the premium of the GOOGL calls will decline strongly as well. With GOOGL stocks, you can just hold on to your stock and wait for better times, while you don't have this luxury with the call options.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nGOOGL has seen its stock price rise strongly in the previous years, systematically beating the S&P 500 stock index. This can be explained by the company's strong fundamentals and its growing revenue from the advertising market. We expect this outperformance to continue in the future with a rising GOOGL stock price.\n\nInvestors who believe in GOOGL can buy common stock at $834 or purchase call options. We prefer the latter alternative, mainly because the implied volatility is this low. Call options are not expensive at these anticipated volatility levels, and investors can use this fact to make an investment in Alphabet Inc.\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are long GOOGL.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.", "It has been a good, but volatile, ride for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ:GOOGL) shareholders in 2017. Now supports are once again firming up both off and on the price chart for GOOGL stock. And for shorter-term investors, a bullishly targeted butterfly is one way to position and capture a nice profit range with limited risk in lieu of owning shares of Alphabet.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhen it comes to large-cap tech outfits like Alphabet, political risks ranging from China to net neutrality to immigration laws remain a question mark. But waiting on a resolution is like waiting on Godot.\n\nIt may take a while. As well, those eventual outcomes could always prove beneficial to GOOGL.\n\nOf course, there are also the potential political supports, such as cash repatriation and favorable corporate tax cuts, to consider. Not only is passage of such legislation more popular and likely easier to push through Congress, it would certainly be a boon for Alphabet.\n\nWhat’s more, GOOGL stock is looking great again after its recent earnings report. Bottom line, earnings missed but growth is back. With its Q4 results, Alphabet proved its business focuses outside the company’s bread-and-butter advertising search revenues, are starting to pay-off for the company.\n\nFor one, mobile search and YouTube both showed strong results and helped with Alphabet’s overall “exceptional” year-over-year sales growth of 24%.\n\nBut newer investments are also coming into their own. The company’s aggressive shift into hardware such as its Pixel smartphone, AI-enhanced Home and virtual reality helped Alphabet grow its “other revenues” by more than 62% on sales of $3.4 billion.\n\nGOOGL Stock Daily Chart\n\nAway from Alphabet’s overall bullish narrative off the price chart, GOOGL stock is showing technical support for a long stake by investors.\n\nFollowing a fairly stiff post-earnings bout of profit-taking from brief all-time-highs, Alphabet has managed to find support from a Fibonacci zone, key price pivot dating back to last February’s high, as well as the intermediate-term, 50-day simple moving average.\n\nNext Page", "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has received an average rating of “Buy” from the forty-seven ratings firms that are covering the firm.

Alphabet's board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to about $7 billion of its Class C stock. While the repurchase program is probably a good idea, is it big enough to really make a difference?\n\nWell timed, but too small\n\nAlphabet's third-quarter announced repurchase program isn't its first. It follows a $5.1 billion repurchase program initiated in the third quarter of 2015. Interestingly, a review of how this program fared can provide some useful insights for the new program.\n\nThe first thing to note about Alphabet's $5.1 repurchase program is that it was well-timed. Share repurchases have the biggest positive impact when they are executed at a lower stock price than where shares end up later on. Fortunately, Alphabet was able to purchase its shares at a discount with its $5.1 program. The stock is up about 20% since Alphabet started repurchasing shares. Further, since about half of this gain came after Alphabet had already exhausted its authorized $5.1 billion repurchases, the timing of the program was particularly keen.\n\nBut because $5.1 billion is hardly a large sum given Alphabet's $521 billion market capitalization, and adding in the fact that Alphabet was averaging over a billion dollars every quarter on stock-based compensation, the net effect of these repurchases were more preventative than accretive when it came to reducing total share count.\n\nIndeed, Alphabet's Class C share count is actually higher in 2016 compared to 2015, despite the $5.1 billion repurchase program.\n\nThis isn't to say Alphabet's repurchase program isn't making a difference. Without these repurchases, Alphabet's share count would be even higher today. Further, since the repurchases were well timed, Alphabet essentially got more bang for its buck than it was actually spending. But this $5.1 billion repurchase program does show that Alphabet is going to need a much bigger authorization if the repurchases are going to have a meaningfully accretive impact on earnings per share.\n\nStill not big enough\n\nWhile Alphabet's new repurchase program is larger, it arguably doesn't represent the jump investors should be hoping for. Like its $5.1 billion program, the $7 billion program will likely also fail to reduce Alphabet's total share count, and it may even fail to fully take advantage of an opportunistic period.\n\nIn Alphabet's third quarter alone, the company diluted shareholder ownership with $1.63 billion in stock-based compensation, up significantly from about $1.28 billion of stock-based compensation in the year-ago quarter. Assuming stock-based compensation continues to grow alongside Alphabet's expected revenue and net income growth throughout 2017, its stock-based compensation during the first twelve months of this program is likely to match or even exceed the $7 billion authorized for repurchases.\n\nAnd looking beyond the simple fact that Alphabet's share repurchase program isn't likely big enough to help reduce its share count, it's also arguable that Alphabet is simply hanging on to too much cash. In its most recent quarter, Alphabet's cash and cash equivalents hit $83 billion, up 14% from its $72.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Further, the search giant is generating significant free cash flow, or cash from operations less capital expenditures, every quarter. In its third quarter alone, Alphabet raked in $7.3 billion in free cash flow.\n\nThe big question mark with Alphabet's new $7 billion repurchase program -- or any repurchase program for that matter -- is whether the timing of purchases will be right. While I'd personally argue that Alphabet's shares are still undervalued, a sell-off in the overall stock market, a recession, or unexpected competitive headwinds, could drive the stock lower and render Alphabet's conservative repurchases today great decisions in hindsight.\n\nBut considering Alphabet's incredible lead in online search, paired with the company's heady cash flow, I'd bet investors would benefit more from an even larger repurchase program.\n\nMaybe Alphabet's decision to repurchase $7 billion this time around instead of $5.1 billion is the beginning of a trend that could turn into more aggressive repurchases down the road. But will Alphabet have missed a great opportunity by then?", "Tech stocks have been in bear mode ever since the election of Donald Trump, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is off 6%. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is down roughly the same. Investors have been rotating out of tech and into other categories such as banking and energy, which seem like sure-fire beneficiaries of the Trump Administration.\n\nBut as is the case with most selloffs, the current dip in tech stocks is providing a nice opportunity for value investors.\n\nI think everyone should be jotting down tech stocks to buy on their Christmas wish lists. But investors should still keep in mind that there are some serious headwinds facing the sector.\n\nYes, Donald Trump has offered up heated rhetoric about immigration and trade — both critical areas that can affect the fortunes of tech companies. But there’s also a lot of uncertainty regarding Trump’s policies in general, and that alone can have another adverse effect on the tech sector. That is, that could make numerous companies less willing to make big-ticket tech purchases.\n\nStill, the market has been deeply discounting a number of tech stocks that should be able to come out ahead despite the political landscape.

And it would be tough to argue with her. In 2016, Google parent Alphabet's revenue and profits increased, its core advertising business, non-advertising initiatives gained significant traction, and it wrapped up the year with two very successful Google-branded hardware launches. Here are eight facts to help capture Alphabet's business in 2016.\n\nTotal revenue increased 20% -- a notable acceleration from 14% year-over-year growth in 2015. And growth even picked up throughout 2016, with the company reporting 22% year-over-year growth in its fourth quarter, or 24% on a constant currency basis.\n\nAlphabet cited mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising as key revenue drivers during the year.\n\nOther bets revenue soared 82%, driven primarily by its smart home Nest products, Google Fiber internet, and Google's life science organization, Verily.\n\nStill, other bets remain unprofitable. Indeed, the segment, which only represents about 1% of Alphabet's total revenue, lost $2.9 billion in 2016 when excluding stock-based compensation -- and this loss was on just $809 million in revenue. Including stock-based compensation, other bets operating loss was a whopping $3.6 billion.\n\nAlphabet spent $3.7 billion repurchasing its own shares. As part of Alphabet's $7 billion repurchase program, the company's share repurchases in 2016 climbed higher. But investors shouldn't expect the share repurchase program to meaningfully reduce the company's shares outstanding, as Alphabet's stock-based award activities are almost just as aggressive. In 2016, Alphabet paid $3.3 billion in stock-based compensation.\n\nOther revenue increased 41%. Not to be confused with Alphabet's much smaller other bets segment, the company's other revenue, which is made up of non-advertising Google products, was driven primarily by Alphabet's Google Play app store, hardware sales, and cloud businesses.\n\nAlphabet introduced Waymo. Buried in Alphabet's other bets business, Alphabet's self-driving car technology development became a stand-alone business called Waymo.\n\n\"Waymo may be a new company, but we're building on advanced self-driving technology developed over many years at Google,\" said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in a December blog post. Alphabet intends for Waymo to commercialize self-driving vehicle hardware and software, aiming to dramatically improve road safety.\n\nIn October, Alphabet launched a smart speaker and a smartphone. The company's voice-activated Google Home speaker and its new Google Pixel phone were clear successes this holiday season. While the company doesn't provide specific sales figures on the device, management did say it was \"thrilled with the reception\" for these devices, and that their success looks promising.\n\nAlphabet made significant progress in its cloud business. Management said in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call that its cloud business is on a \"terrific upswing.\" With the help of Alphabet's well-timed $625 million acquisition of API provider Apigee, Alphabet made particular progress differentiating its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by sharpening its offerings in data analytics, machine learning, security, and tools for application development. Further, in 2016, Alphabet's Google Cloud's G Suite product, which offers cloud-based collaboration and productivity applications, garnered more than three million paying customers by the end of the year.\n\nGoing into 2017, Alphabet will be up against a strong benchmark: itself. With a tough year-over-year comparison of 20% revenue growth in 2016, the company will need to continue executing well across Google advertising and YouTube, as well as its smaller businesses like hardware and cloud. Further, while Alphabet's other bets are still too small to help overall revenue growth in 2017, investors should continue to look for promising signs from the segment this year.", "Google parent company, Alphabet Inc, posted an increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by the continued success of the company's mobile and YouTube video advertising business.\n\nAlphabet's revenue jumped to $26.1 billion, up 22 percent over the same quarter last year, surpassing Wall Street estimates. Net income saw an 8.3-percent increase to $5.33 billion, missing estimates, which the company blamed on a one-time tax adjustment. Shares fell 2.1 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nA huge chunk of the company's revenue increase mostly came from Google's advertising business, $3.4 billion of which comes from other business segments like hardware sales, Google's Play Store and its Cloud services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClicks on Google ads or paid clicks - ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them - saw a 36-percent increase in the fourth quarter compared to the 33-percent increase seen in the third quarter.\n\n\"Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional - with revenues up 22 percent year-on-year and 24 percent on a constant currency basis,\" said Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet.\n\n\"This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube. We're seeing great momentum in Google's newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in other bets,\" Porat added.\n\nAccording to an article on Reuters, the company's quarterly results were met with a mixed reaction from Wall Street, which sent shares toppling 2.2 percent to $838 in extended trade after closing at $856.98 on Nasdaq.\n\nThe article mentioned Google faced a higher tax rate of 22 percent, compared to the 19 percent for the year overall, and this has contributed to the dent in profitability.\n\n\"If you look above that, it's business as usual,\" said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. \"There has been no margin compression in the actual business.\"\n\nAlphabet's Other Bets revenue saw an increase of $262 million from the $150 million a year earlier, while the operating loss of $1.09 billion narrowed from $1.21 billion." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1405381306324702, 0.09711538461538462 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.5272604753736828, 0.3185897435897435 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-01-30T00:00:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-02-01T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

(GOOGL): YouTube Ad Controversy" ], "article_text" : [ "Alphabet stock slid for the third time in four days as investors continued to worry about how serious the damage from the YouTube problems will be. At least one analyst downgraded Alphabet stock earlier this week after reports of big brand advertisers pulling away from YouTube and Google Display Network because their ads were being placed with offensive videos, particularly content that promotes hate or terrorism.\n\nHowever, not all analysts are worried, as the Google parent company may be too big for it to matter.\n\nAlphabet stock price target still at $1,000\n\nIn a research note dated March 23, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak reiterated his Overweight rating and $1,000 price target on Alphabet stock. He noted that the headlines related to the fiasco are likely to weigh on the stock’s multiple, but he anticipates that the impact in dollars will be small. He pegs display ads at 10% of the company’s net revenues and adds that the business has “high advertiser diversification.”\n\nDespite his skepticism that this is a serious problem for Google and YouTube, he does note that this is a real concern that the company will have to address, citing his conversations with advertisers and other participants in the industry. Google is making some efforts to fix the problem such as raising the bar on its ad policies. However, Nowak notes that today’s report that Verizon, AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, Enterprise and others have pulled back their spending with the company demonstrates that it isn’t doing enough.\n\nA concern, but not yet\n\nHe added that this issue will be a key one to keep tabs on in the next few weeks because he does see the headlines and the possibility of more advertisers dropping out as a “likely tactical headwind” for Alphabet stock and its multiple. He noted that YouTube has successfully worked through problems like this in the past though.\n\nEven though he sees the validity of the concerns, if the company does deal with them, he sees a “low probability” that they will have any serious impact on the company’s near-term results. One reason is because advertisers that pulled their ad dollars are only doing it from YouTube and the Google Display Network and not from its other properties.\n\nFurther, he estimates that the affected businesses make up 21% of the company’s gross revenues, with YouTube at 12%, and 10% of net revenues. He said if 10% of Alphabet’s gross revenue disappears, it would only drain 1% of its net revenue. And finally, he feels that the company’s revenues are “diversified across millions of clients – with the top 100 ad spenders likely representing less than 20% of total ad revenue.”\n\nAlphabet stock downgraded earlier this week\n\nNowak doesn’t feel that Alphabet stock is expensive at current levels, so he feels that investors should take advantage of any pullback in the shares in the next few days or weeks. However, not everyone is so upbeat on the outcome from these issues. On Monday, Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser downgraded Alphabet stock, moving to Hold from Buy. He also bumped his price target down a bit from $970 to $950 per share.\n\nInvestorPlace noted that Alphabet stock fell below its short-term 20-day moving average and then after today’s drop, the shares fell below their 50-day moving average. This level has supported the stock twice since the middle of December, the website notes. The stock’s Relative Strength Index also tumbled to 38, although it hasn’t reached oversold levels yet. However, InvestorPlace warns that Alphabet stock may drop to the next support at around $810, but the 200-day moving average sits just under $800 a share.\n\nThe stock closed down 1.19% at $839.65 on Thursday.", "Can YouTube ad issues really dent Alphabet Inc stock?\n\n\n\nFlickr\n\nShares of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are down almost 4% this week after some advertisers started pulling out their advertising from Google’s display network. This was a result of the search engine company's programmatic advertising, which seemingly was not able to stop mainstream brand ads from appearing alongside extremist and offensive material. And the exodus continues with few more big names recently pulling out their ads from Google's YouTube platform for similar reasons as mentioned above. We had recently pointed out that shares of Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google, could be headed for a near-term correction. So, is GOOGL stock headed much lower? Also, Google's latest ad woes have earned Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock an analyst rating downgrade as well. Should investors be worried? Let's take a closer.\n\nWhat are the Analysts saying?\n\nThe latest YouTube ad woes don't seem to have gone down well with investment firm Pivotal Research. Brian Wieser, Pivotal Research analyst downgraded GOOGL stock to Hold rating from Buy. The reason cited for the downgrade was the lack of control over ad placement on YouTube and the fact that this issue was being cited by major advertisers to withdraw their ad campaigns from the YouTube platform. Brian Wieser opines that Google may have done serious harm and that this could have global repercussions. On account of this, he reduced their \"forecasts for Alphabet by approximately one percentage point for this year and the next. He cut his 2017 estimates to $107.9 billion in revenue and $40.75 per share in net income from a prior $108.8 billion and $24.4 billion.\" He slashed his Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock price target from $970 to $950, which still has more than 13% upside from yesterday's close.\n\nHowever, another Brian does not seem to go down Brian Wieser's way. A Valuewalk post reports that Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak in his latest research note reiterated his Overweight rating and $1,000 price target on GOOGL stock. While he was quick to add, based on his interactions with all participants of the advertising industry, that the ongoing YouTube issue was a real concern for the search giant, he is of the view that impact on the stock would be minimal. He states that \"the affected businesses make up 21% of the company’s gross revenues, with YouTube at 12%, and 10% of net revenues\" and \"if 10% of Alphabet’s gross revenue disappears, it would only drain 1% of its net revenue.\" Brian Nowak further adds that the advertisers pulling out are \"only doing it from YouTube and the Google Display Network, and not from its other properties\". He estimates that display ads constitute only 10% of the company’s net revenues and finally highlights that \"the company’s revenues are diversified across millions of clients – with the top 100 ad spenders likely representing less than 20% of total ad revenue.\"\n\nGoogle is expected to continue its dominance in digital ad space.\n\nIn its latest research report, eMarketer states that the search giant will maintain its dominance in digital ads taking in 40.7% of US digital ad revenues in 2017—more than double of what Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) would make. The eMarketer research \"expects Google’s share of the search market to grow 16.1% to $28.55 billion in 2017. The search giant will claim roughly 78% of total US search ad revenues this year\". eMarketer forecasting analyst Monica Peart states that Google is set to benefit greatly from users' behavioral shift to mobile search on increasing usage of smartphones. An important point to note here is that the ongoing ad fiasco is largely related to Google's Display Network, where Google lags Facebook by some distance, but in that too eMarketer projects Display Network revenue will rise to $5.24 billion in 2017. The above-cited research had just come recently before the YouTube ad exodus. However, as highlighted by the Morgan Stanley analyst above, the impact on the Google's bottom line due to current ad woes could be minimal and the above estimates may not vary in a drastic way.\n\nGoogle is still the best.\n\nGoogle is not the only internet company that is facing issues with programmatic ad buying, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) and Facebook have had their own share of such issues in the recent past. In response to this whole issue, Google has come out with a public apology through Google's Europe head, Matt Brittin in his address at Advertising Week European conference in London. It also promises to give advertisers more control over where their ads run and make it easier to report any problems such as the recent ones. Paul Verna, principal analyst with eMarketer opines that \"Google needs to sit down with the advertisers that are pulling their ads and reassure them that they're doing more than just issuing an apology. Beyond that, they're going to have to put some other level of human interface into the system, which may be easier said than done because they're handling an almost unimaginable stream of content.\"\n\nEric Schiffler, CEO of digitalmarketing.com as quoted on ThStreet.com conceded that \"Google is still the smartest and the best solution for the great aggregated and targeted traffic, but they have to get their act together\". A Wall Street post also echoes similar views that big advertisers will return to Google, but the latter needs to be cautious in the way it deals with this issue, otherwise, it may be stung hard. It is still early days to write off Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock on account of the current YouTube crisis.\n\nConclusion.\n\nIn spite of the current YouTube issues, GOOGL stock still looks an attractive investment for long-term investors. Google continues to deliver double-digit revenue growth despite its massive revenue base. It is widely anticipated now that Google Cloud would be catching up with Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and that could be a tailwind for GOOGL stock going ahead. A leading technical indicator, Bollinger Band, suggests that Google stock is set for rebound as it is deemed to be oversold. For now, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) shares have hit the lower Bollinger band, indicating that the stock is currently in oversold territory, and could rebound soon. Taking a long-term view, Google stock is still a good bet for 2017.\n\nWe believe that shares of Alphabet Inc are headed higher, and we like the stock fundamentally, to the extent that we've added it to our list of top stock picks, which have beaten the NASDAQ by over 134%.\n\nIf you think that's impressive, and you're also looking for good stocks from the auto sector, here's our list of top auto stock picks, which have beaten the S&P 500 by over 170%.", "In the wake of several European advertisers reportedly pulling their advertising for Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in the last week, some U.S. advertisers have come out and done the same. The advertisers' concerns stem around what content ads are being served against, with many worried that hateful or offensive content is being associated with their brands. Pacific Crest thinks this is an industry-wide problem, not just a Google problem, that comes with the scale and complexity of digital advertising. Despite the posturing of some of these large advertisers, that doesn't change the fact that deteriorating linear TV viewership is forcing a shift of ad dollars, and YouTube has the most quality video inventory of anyone. Pacific Crest thinks with Google's acknowledgement of the issue, and the vast resources it has to fix it, that there will be an effective solution in place in short order.\n\nThere have been these controversies before, and there will be again, and the solutions to address these issues are only getting better with machine learning. Ad products like Google Preferred already allow advertisers to choose a subset of content partners to associate with and various other tools, so there are already solutions in place to address this and they'll only get better. It's in the interest of Google to further address this issue, so Pacific Crest thinks it's very likely more tools and techniques will be put in place to give advertisers more control.\n\nMost Google advertising revenue is bought on well-defined metrics and ROI profiles, and the ROI will remain solid as long as consumers are on the platform. So, unless the bad press causes people to stop using Google services (unlikely), then Pacific Crest’s estimates should not be meaningfully impacted.\n\nGOOGL is already very inexpensive, and the firm thinks any chance to buy it cheaper should be taken advantage of. The bottom line is Google's interests align with advertisers in getting this fixed, so Pacific Crest expects Google to continue developing tools to address the issue in short order.\n\nPacific Crest’s price target of $1,040 is based on 16x EV/EBITDA, using its 2017 Google EBITDA estimate of $38.9 billion, which implicitly assigns zero net value for \"Other Bets.\" Market and macroeconomic conditions could interfere with the realization of this price target, as could risks such as entering new markets, the global macroeconomy, increasing competition outside of search, industry changes brought about by the shift to mobile and the difficulty of managing high growth based on its non-core investments" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ -0.03450191570881225, 0.1170577130528587, 0.09764866712235136 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3968582375478926, 0.4519147788565264, 0.4179329004329004 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-23T17:06:46.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-03-24T07:30:47.000+0000" }, null ] }

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) disrupts how we shop, while Airbnb disrupts where we stay. Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) disrupts what we drive, and Uber even disrupts whether we drive. If a teen with 2 million Instagram followers can disrupt how billion-dollar businesses find customers, the rest of us need to dive in and start swimming … or at least buy the one stock which has its hands in all of the above: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ).\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSimply put, GOOGL stock is the most innovative, most disruptive and cheapest $800 equity I know.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nSilicon Valley money manager Michael Moe and his team at GSV Asset Management produce a provocative weekly newsletter dedicated to highlighting where they think the world is going. While doing research for my Bullseye Brief, one of their recent pieces got me thinking about innovation in more tangible terms. The team ranked eight global technology companies based on their involvement across 22 cutting-edge categories. Hands down, Alphabet ranks No. 1, capturing 21 of 22.\n\nInnovation Leaders\n\nCuriously, all eight GSV-highlighted companies have dedicated efforts in the areas of artificial intelligence, big data and cloud services, making these three the Holy Grail of innovation.\n\nThe first two come as no surprise, as data gathering and analysis are critical to predicting behavior, enabling companies to target consumers accordingly. Web services, which is now the fastest-growing segment for Amazon, is less obvious but nonetheless a clear indicator these innovators want to get bigger by serving as the backbone for other companies.\n\nThis is key, and since Google already commands 49% of the global online advertising market according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, I’ll bet on GOOGL.\n\nMoonshot\n\nMuch of Google’s innovative efforts happen at its off-site research center called Google X, aka the Moonshot Factory. It’s run by a futurist named Astro Teller, and I highly recommend his TED Talk explaining how Google X approaches innovation:\n\nIdentify a problem affecting millions of people. Find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem. Move full speed ahead if there’s reason to believe technology for such a radical solution could actually be built.\n\nHe says Google X people spend most of their time “breaking things and trying to prove they’re wrong” but believes that’s their secret … what makes Googlers different. By “killing” more projects than they approve, their success rate rises. Alphabet spent $13.8 billion last year on research and development — the second highest number of any company in the world behind Amazon, and second highest as a percentage of sales among the eight innovation leaders.\n\nR&D as % of Revenue\n\nAlphabet invests a staggering amount of money to fund R&D, both because it can and because it has to. With three times more online advertising than its next closest competitor, GOOGL is a cash cow.\n\nBy the same token, it has significant overlap with all seven competitors in the most obvious categories — like robotics and AI– and each of these companies is hungry to dominate.\n\nThere’s no letting up in this crowd. Innovate or die.\n\nWhat’s GOOGL Stock Worth?\n\nUltimately, the question is value: What do we pay?\n\nNext Page", "A strong earnings report from Apple (AAPL) late Tuesday and earnings reports coming up late Wednesday from Facebook (FB) and late Thursday from Amazon.com (AMZN) are putting even more focus on the Apple-plus-FANG stocks.\n\nFANG refers to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (NFLX) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL), leading internet stocks often grouped with Apple.\n\nApple Touches 18-Month Highs\n\nApple stock soared to 18-month highs Wednesday after the company's earnings beat consensus estimates, fueled by record iPhone sales. Apple's fiscal first quarter marked a return to growth for the company, which had seen declining sales and EPS in the preceding three quarters.\n\nApple stock jumped 6.2% to 128.87 in the stock market today, hitting its highest price since July 2015. Apple stock touched its record high of 134.54 in April 2015. Apple broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Jan. 9, clearing a buy point at 118.12, so shares are now extended.\n\nFacebook Ad Growth Should Highlight Q4 Results\n\nFacebook reports fourth-quarter earnings after the market close Wednesday, where analysts will focus on advertising revenue growth. During its Q3 conference call, Facebook warned that the growth pace of advertising dollars would slow, due to ad saturation\n\nWall Street expects Facebook to report revenue of $8.5 billion, up 46% year over year and the second quarter in a row of revenue deceleration.\n\nThe revenue slowdown is attributable mostly to a deliberate move by Facebook to cool the growth in advertising to avoid saturation. Analysts expect earnings per share minus items to rise 66% to $1.31, also marking further cooling after huge gains of 91% in Q3 and 94% in Q2.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Facebook is developing a video app for television set-top boxes, including Apple TV, as it looks for ways to grow ad sales.\n\nFacebook stock closed Wednesday up 2.2% ahead of its Q4 earnings report, at 133.23. Shares remain in a buy zone from their breakout last week at 129.37.\n\nAmazon Air Force Taking Flight\n\nAmazon confirmed late Tuesday that it will build its first centralized air hub, in Kentucky, to support its growing fleet of Prime Air cargo planes. At the site, Amazon expects to create more than 2,000 new jobs. Amazon says it already employs 10,000 in the Bluegrass State.\n\nAmazon reports earnings after the market close Thursday, with concerns that heavy investments and currency exchange could dampen earnings.\n\nAnalysts estimate revenue of $44.7 billion, which would be up 25% from Q4 2015 and maintain a steady string of double-digit growth going back more than four years. Analysts expect earnings per share minus items to rise 35% to $1.35.\n\nAmazon stock rose 1.1% to 832.19 Wednesday, still in a buy zone.\n\nAlphabet Undercuts Breakout Price\n\nAlphabet reported fourth-quarter results last Thursday, with the company missing views on earnings per share but topping expectations on revenue.\n\nAlphabet stock fell 0.6% Wednesday to 815.24. That undercuts its breakout at a buy point of 824.40 first touched on Jan. 6.\n\nNetflix Still Extended From Breakout\n\nNetflix stock rose 7 cents to 140.78 on Wednesday. The stock remains extended from its last buy point at 129.40, out of a cup-with-handle base, first touched on Jan. 4.\n\nNetflix remains a member of the IBD Leaderboard of top-performing stocks at or near buy points, though the stock has met resistance around 142 for nearly two weeks.\n\nRELATED:\n\nFacebook Still In Early Stages Of Growth Despite Massive Size\n\nFacebook Stock Buyback May Signal Slower Growth As Company Matures\n\nAmazon Plants A 'We're Hiring' Sign To Reach 100,000 New Jobs" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.07461215932914045, 0.06645877378435518 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4134156933213537, 0.4718780831571528 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-02-01T13:40:32.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-02-01T13:04:55.000+0000" } ] }

GOOGL , as the tech giant prepares to release its fourth-quarter earnings report on Thursday. The company rolled out its new Google Pixel phone and ushered in a new era of hardware-software interaction during the quarter, making this week's announcement even more important than usual.\n\nIn fact, the Google Pixel will most likely be the most compelling aspect of Alphabet's latest report, and investors will be clamoring to know how the device sold. It will also be interesting to see what the company says about its Google Home Controller, which also launched in the U.S. this quarter.\n\nThe Google Pixel is important because it is Alphabet's first high-end smartphone entirely produced in-house and represents a significant challenge to Apple's AAPL iPhone line. The Google Home tells another story of competition; the \"Internet of Things\" in-home hub is one of the only competitors to Amazon's AMZN Echo speaker.\n\nMore importantly, both of these products underscore Alphabet's efforts to usher in its intelligent personal assistant software, Google Assistant. With similar functions to Apple's Siri and Microsoft's MSFT Cortana, Google Assistant is the backbone of the Pixel and Home devices and promises to be the foundation for all of Google's original products heading forward.\n\nAlso, investors should not forget about the other products that Google launched in the quarter, all of which were officially unveiled at the same event in October. The company debuted its stylish headset for the Daydream VR platform, the \"Daydream View,\" as well as its first router, \"Google Wifi,\" and a Chromecast update, \"Chromecast Ultra.\"\n\nAll of these products are important pieces of Google's effort to create a complete line of products that work together and with the new Google Assistant software. This is just the first quarter of sales, but it is also the holiday quarter and should give us a good idea of whether or not these products are resonating with shoppers.\n\nHeading into the report, Alphabet Inc. has seen one positive estimate revision over the past week. Our current consensus estimates indicate EPS growth of 8.40% and sales growth of 18.75%, and this has helped earn the company an \"A\" grade for growth. This is especially noteworthy given the relative size and status of Alphabet already. Overall, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and that's always a good sign heading into an earnings announcement.\n\nNevertheless, Alphabet currently has an Earnings ESP of -0.26%, which makes surprise prediction a bit more difficult.\n\nZacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2017\n\nIn addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?\n\nWho wouldn't?

This includes a win in November after I explained how to collect free dividends on GOOGL stock as we collected over 15% in yield on money risked.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge Alphabet’s fundamentals have not changed. I still like it for the long-term. Management continues to execute very well on the cash cow businesses. Better still: Spending on the fringe projects seems to be under control for now.\n\nTechnically, GOOGL stock was tested in late 2016 but has since recovered. Traders sold Alphabet stock and others mega-tech companies like Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) to roll into the Trump trade. Since then, the selling abated and the trade unwound.\n\nNow, mega-tech companies are going into earnings with the winds in their sails. That includes Alphabet, which reports on Thursday, Jan. 26, after the bell.\n\nHow to Trade GOOGL Stock Now\n\nThe Trade: Buy the GOOGL Feb $835/$837.50 debit call spread for $1.20 per contract to open. This is my maximum potential risk. I stand to double my money if GOOGL stock rallies past my spread in the next few weeks.\n\nPremiums are usually elevated ahead of earnings, and sometimes we see a move ahead of the report. If so, then I could close the spread and book partial profits early.\n\nUsually I like to balance my trades by doing the opposite. But this time, since we are going into earnings, I will not sell any bearish risk into GOOGL earnings. Another hedge idea would be to short the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQ ). But today, I will do neither. Instead, I will simply go long Alphabet Inc options as a lottery ticket betting on a positive reaction to their earnings.\n\nI could further juice this trade by adding a credit put spread to collect premium and offset my out of pocket expense. However, this adds more downside risk. Personally, I prefer to wait until after the earnings report before I sell premium into GOOGL.\n\nStill, if you’d like …\n\nThe Juice (Optional): Sell the GOOGL Mar $750/$745 credit put spread for 65 cents per contract. This trade would yield 13% if GOOGL stays above my sold spread while I am holding. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success with a 10% price buffer.\n\nEarnings events add a short-term wild card to credit spreads; the short-term adverse reactions are often short-lived.\n\nI am not required to hold any option trade open through expiration. I can close any of them at any time for partial gains or losses.\n\nNicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

But what’s new here is that Google will allow a third-party company to monitor videos that are part of Google’s so-called preferred advertising program, which only includes higher-quality videos or YouTube channels with large followings, such as PewDiePie.\n\nPewDiePie is a YouTube star whose allegedly anti-Semitic videos caused a huge stir with advertisers whose ads were posted alongside of it. Google nixed PewDiePie (real name Felix Kjellberg) from its preferred ad program as a result, and Disney dropped its partnership with him as well.\n\nAs we reported last month, many advertisers — especially ones based in the U.K. — pulled their ads from Google’s platforms citing concerns of associating their brand with questionable content.

Since its release, Google Assistant — the new AI powered personal assistant — has been a Pixel Phone exclusive. Third-party smartphones remain stuck with the previous generation Google Now. However, Google released an Android “alpha” build late last week and the new Android release enables Google Assistant on third-party smartphones.\n\nSource: Google\n\nGOOGL’s third-party Android smartphone partners have been feeling a little betrayed since the release of the Pixel Phone last fall.\n\nUp until then, Google had not been directly competing against them. It developed Android and allowed them to use the operating system on their phones for free — a fair trade off for the hundreds of millions of mobile devices defaulting to revenue-generating Google search. Google did release the Nexus line of smartphones, but they were more of a showcase for Android than an attempt to compete against its partners.\n\nThe Pixel Phone’s Google Assistant Advantage\n\nThe Pixel Phone changed the equation. It was stamped with the Google name for the first time and it was designed to compete head-to-head with the best of the Android smartphones. In another first, a key new Android feature — Google Assistant — was a Pixel Phone exclusive. Google Assistant leverages Alphabet’s latest AI technology in a personal digital assistant that goes beyond Google Now, even gaining the ability to participate in two-way conversations.\n\nThe situation was serious enough to help convince Android smartphone leader Samsung Electronic Co Ltd (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) that it needed its own personal assistant. Samsung’s Bixby is expected to debut on the Galaxy S8.\n\nNew Android Release Spills the Beans: Google Assistant for All?\n\nAndroid Police examined a developer “alpha” release of Android over the weekend and discovered that GOOGL may be having a change of heart about keeping Google Assistant to itself.\n\nIts team was able to activate and use Google Assistant on several non-Pixel smartphones, including a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 running Android Marshmallow and a Nexus 6P running Android Nougat.\n\nThis means that GOOGL is at least experimenting with making Google Assistant available to third-party smartphones in an upcoming new Android release.\n\nNext Page", "The Google Flights tool has stood in the shadow of the more well-known online travel leaders, however, some on Wall Street think the new and updated features could help Flights surpass them all.\n\nOn Friday, RBC Capital hosted a conference call with Research Director Luke Bujarski, Senior Research Analyst Jared Wein, and Skift Executive Editor Dennis Schaal to discuss Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) impact on the travel industry.\n\nAccording to Skift, Google Flights is gaining momentum and continues to see traction. Of note, Skift believes Google Flights is being particularly aggressive in the U.S. and appears to be gaining share from competitors. To put some context around this, according to Google Trends data, the term “Google Flights” in the U.S. rose 22-pts in January, compared with a 12-pt increase for “Kayak,” “Skyscanner” and “Momondo” combined. On the other hand, Google Hotel Ads, which is essentially Google’s metasearch platform, is underperforming relative to Google Flights.\n\n“Skift estimates Google owns up to 90% of the digital travel advertising market, translating into ~$12B of revenue in 2016 with the major OTA’s accounting for roughly half of that revenue. Among the OTA’s, Priceline pays Google the most, which Skift’s estimates is ~50% more than Expedia and >5x as much a TripAdvisor. Overall, Skift expects digital travel ad spend to grow 20% annually and believes the OTA’s will continue to hold the same share. That said, the OTA’s are likely to continue experimenting with other channels but these remain largely experimental and aspirational,” the RBC team noted.\n\nRBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney currently rates GOOGL at Buy, with a price target of $1025, which represents a potential upside of 23% from where the stock is currently trading.\n\nAccording to TipRanks.com, which measures analysts’ and bloggers’ success rate based on how their calls perform, analyst Mark Mahaney has a yearly average return of 21.4% and a 72% success rate. Mahaney has a 15.4% average return when recommending GOOGL, and is ranked #4 out of 4428 analysts.\n\nOut of the 29 analysts polled in the past 12 months, 27 rate Alphabet stock a Buy, 1 rates the stock a Hold and 1 recommends to Sell. With a return potential of nearly 18%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $989.14.", "Rising mobile search volume is putting pressure on Alphabet Inc's margins.\n\n\n\nFlickr\n\nChanges in the way people access the internet are causing some trouble for Mountain View, California-based search engine giant Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), formerly known as Google. People are no longer waiting to reach their home or office to access their desktops. Rather, more and more people are googling on their mobile devices. More searches are happening on mobile than on desktop. This shifting trend represents both an opportunity as well as a challenge for Google. During the latest earnings call, Google's CFO Ruth Porat mentioned mobile as one of the important growth drivers. However, rising mobile search is also impacting Google's margins. In its latest quarterly earnings release, Google’s parent Alphabet reported a miss on its earnings, largely due to the decline in cost per click, which was impacted by the increase in mobile search.\n\nGoogle mobile ads get more clicks but make less money.\n\nFor a while now, mobile search has been growing at a much faster clip than desktop search. According to marketing research firm, eMarketer, in the United States, mobile search volumes surpassed desktop search volumes last year. The rising growth in mobile search has benefitted Google as it has been able to corner a large part of the mobile search business. According to Digital marketing firm Merkle, Google received 96% of all search-ad clicks on mobile devices in the fourth quarter.\n\nSource: eMarketer\n\nHowever, the problem for Google is that mobile ads fetch lesser money than desktop ads. Cost per click, or the money google makes every time a user clicks an ad continued to fall in the fourth quarter. Google's strategy for mobile has largely been to either figure out new advertising formats, or generate more money from the much larger volume of impressions mobile devices generate. Until now, Google has been able to offset its declining cost-per-click with more impressions to generate impressive results. But Google will need to figure out a way to improve its cost-per-click on mobile.\n\nGoogle is facing a rising threat from Amazon Inc.\n\nThe predominance of mobile is also changing the way people search. People looking to travel are more likely to search on the Priceline or Expedia app, rather than going through Google search. The same is the story with shopping. People who are planning to buy products are more likely to start their search on Amazon, than on Google. According to a report on Business Insider, Amazon is slowly eating into Google's territory by becoming the go-to place for eCommerce search. Around 52% of people start their search for online shopping on Amazon, and only 26% use search engines like Google as the starting point. While Amazon is currently a tiny player in the ad business with its 2016 ad revenues coming in at $1.2 billion, compared to Google's $79 billion, the rise of Amazon's Alexa could be a serious threat to Google.\n\nYet another trend which is likely to benefit Amazon is the rise in voice searches. With the arrival of personal assistants like Apple's Siri, Google Allo, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana, more people are finding it convenient to use these digital assistants, rather than typing a question into the search bar. Globally, voice-based searches jumped from almost zero to 10% in 2015 and doubled to 20% in 2016. With more people using voice searches, the importance of devices like Amazon's Echo and Google Home is only likely to increase. And currently, Echo is clearly the more popular device. Also, Alexa is finding its way into devices of several other companies like Ford, and even Google's Android ecosystem for that matter. Chinese firm Huawei Technologies, which manufactures android based smartphones announced during CES 2017 that its flagship handset will come with an app which will give its US users access to Alexa. According to Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, \"To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google’s voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that’s a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue,\"\n\nAlphabet stock is still a good buy.\n\nThe shift in search trends are clearly a concern for Google. However, the company is making several efforts to capture more value from mobile ads. Google recently introduced new tools and features to AdWords to specifically address the consumer shift towards mobile, which will allow it to generate more value from mobile ads. In spite of these rising headwinds, Alphabet stock remains a good long-term buy. The average analysts' price target of $990 indicates an 18% upside for GOOGL stock from the current price." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1461564171122995, 0.08616771159874609, 0.1773824148824149 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4472370766488415, 0.3768808777429468, 0.503147303147303 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-02-13T18:00:14.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-02-13T00:00:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-02-14T06:13:59.000+0000" } ] }

Reworked Its Letters This Year (GOOGL, FB)" ], "article_text" : [ "In his letter introducing Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) to investors, the conglomerate’s chairman, Larry Page, wrote that “the whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands.” The newly named company, Alphabet, was the grown-up Google, which had diverse interests and money-making ventures.\n\nAt the end of Alphabet’s first year as a conglomerate, things have not turned out as Page had anticipated.\n\nGoogle Is Still the Soul\n\nGoogle still remains the heart and soul of the company and the search engine mints money for the conglomerate. For example, the Mountain View company reported revenues of $22.2 billion in the latest quarter on the back of mobile and video advertising.\n\nTo put that into context, rival Facebook Inc. (FB) reported revenues of $17.9 billion for the entire year of 2015. Google is essentially the bank from which other ventures within the Alphabet umbrella borrow money to finance themselves. (See also: Google's Six Most Profitable Lines Of Business.)\n\nStruggling Ventures\n\nBut the individual brands that Page referenced in his introductory letter will take time to come into their own. They did not make news for all the right reasons in 2016.\n\nIn June, the New York Times reported that Nest founder and CEO Tony Fadell had quote the company after leadership problems. The company is a maker of hardware products and had been acquired by Google $3.2 billion back in 2014. Another casualty within the Alphabet umbrella was Google Fiber, the company’s broadband division. According to an October report in The New York Times, the company dismissed its 130 employees and stopped expansion to other cities.\n\nScaled-Back Ambitions\n\nGoogle also scaled back its ambitions of manufacturing a self-driving car after it failed to find a manufacturing partner. Instead, the self-driving unit was spun out into a separate software unit – called Waymo - that partners with established car manufacturers to install self-driving car technology. (See also: Google Spins Off New Self-Driving Car Technology.)\n\nPerhaps the overarching theme in these news bits is Alphabet’s attempts to rein in profligate spending, a quality that separates the company from its contemporaries. The entry of Ruth Porat from Morgan Stanley has brought about this change.\n\nA July report in the Wall Street Journal detailed Porat's efforts to pare spending by spending more judiciously on research and cutting back on profligate hiring. She has also forced divisions within the conglomerate to reconsider their moonshots within the context of costs and budgeting. A Bloomberg report towards the end of this year detailed how Google X, the company’s moonshots division, instituted cost controls and budgeting after her entry.\n\nRisks and Budgets\n\nThis does not mean that Alphabet has become a boring venture aimed at minting money and profits. It was the company’s unpredictability and willingness to take risks that endeared it to investors. The markets reflected that optimism and faith this year, when they pushed it to become the world’s most valuable company, surpassing rival Apple Inc. (AAPL). (See also: Alphabet Is Now Bigger Than Apple).\n\nThat said, Alphabet has matured. It’s risk-taking will now be underpinned with greater Wall Street transparency and budgeted timelines, if developments in 2016 are any indication." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1060457687473816 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4887009495880464 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-29T17:32:00.000+0000" } ] }

All three of the major indices touched-up on their respective 50-day moving averages during trading yesterday to find some support. This is the first time that technicals have had to step in as support since December.\n\nThe next two days will determine success or failure, so traders will spend their days trading both sides of the market for the rest of the week to see how this first test of 2017 plays out.\n\nToday’s three big stock charts looks at the price musings of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS ), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN ) as three stocks that are facing similarly critical tests of their technical standings.\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS)\n\nThe logistics/delivery company has been locked in a trading range since its disappointing earnings report dropped the shares by more than 10%. Now, after several tests of what has turned into critical chart support, UPS shares are testing $104 for support again.\n\nThe level ($104) can be tracked back to April and May of 2016 as a significant support level, which is why the traders are keying some buying off it now.\n\nThe touch of $104 comes while UPS shares are touching down on oversold readings from the stock’s RSI. This indicates that the flow of selling pressure is likely to ebb and fewer buyers will be needed to change the momentum for the short-term.\n\nA break below $104 will target another 4% to 5% decline in the shares as $100 is the next clear line of support. According to our model, the stock remains in the short- and intermediate-term bearish category given the technical breakdowns and the declining 50-day moving average.\n\nAlphabet Inc (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet shares have snapped lower over the last week and now reside in a technical “rock and hard place” situation.\n\nGOOGL stock sold out of an overbought situation as it hit $875 right through its first level of support drawn by its 50-day moving average at $843. Friday and Monday’s additional selling pressure dropped Alphabet stock to test its 100-day moving average at $825. This is the second time that GOOGL shares have fallen against this trendline for support in as many months.\n\nTraders need to keep an eye on the trend of the 50-day moving average on Alphabet stock as it appears to be transitioning from a bullish ascending pattern to a neutral and potentially bearish declining trend. This will have a negative implication on the price target for GOOGL shares over the short-term outlook.\n\nFor now, maintain an eye on $820, which represents the stock’s 100-day moving average. A break below this will see Alphabet move into that short-term bearish pattern with an initial price target of $800.\n\nNext Page", "Investors and analysts are typically super focused on company earnings numbers when they are reported. Company earnings are a good way to evaluate the company profitability. Currently, sell-side analysts are expecting Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to report quarterly EPS of $7.2.

On a consensus basis, analysts have pinned a $964.428 mean target price for the short term on the stock. The most lofty price projection sees the stock reaching $1100 within the year, while the most conservative has a $700 target on the name. In looking at the standard deviation of all estimates, we arrive at 78.388.\n\nZacks provides a simpler approach for understanding analyst recommendations on stocks, using an integer based system which converts each recommendation into a 1-5 average, where 1 represents a Strong Buy and 5 a Strong Sell. Compiling all of the recommendations for the firm, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) current has a mean recommendation of 1.33.

GOOGL’s self-driving car project, now known as Waymo, is in discussions to bring a second auto heavy-hitter under its belt.\n\nOn Wednesday, Honda made some waves revealing it is in conversation to test Alphabet’s Waymo in assorted cars, exploring use of sensors to computers to software.\n\nThis would mark Waymo’s second strategic partnership, as there already is a collaboration in the making with carmaker Fiat Chrysler, widely anticipated to kick-start a ride-hailing service with self-driving cars by the close of 2017.\n\nJust one week prior, after having been in the Google X research lab for eight years, Alphabet’s self-driving car project realized into an independent, separate company, Waymo, with a priority on selling its technology over building cars.\n\nWorthy of note, the Google-parent company plans to keep under wraps the revenue and profitability of its self-driving tech company, with its financial results to be mixed under a branch titled “Other Bets” with the rest of non-Google businesses.\n\nRuth Porat, GOOGL Chief Financial Officer has advocated for investors to judge Other Bets throughout the course of a “long horizon,” keeping in mind viewing financial results through an “early stage” dose of perspective.\n\nWaymo is adamant in its quest “that there will be more self-driving cars sooner, available from a variety of automakers.” Meanwhile, from Honda’s perspective, “These discussions are an initial step that will allow Waymo and Honda R&D to further explore the potential of a broad range of automated driving technologies.”\n\nThough these discussions are only just the beginning of a potential partnership, clearly both companies are serious enough to make even just initial talks a matter of news-worthy attention. Clearly both Waymo and Honda see it to their favor to make this dialogue public, perhaps to drum up further investor interest.\n\nBrian Fitzgerald of research firm Jefferies for one finds the move encouraging, asserting, “The news supports our expectation that Waymo will be focused on technology with the potential to license to vehicle manufacturers rather than making the cars themselves.”\n\nMoving forward, Waymo outlines the goal that this collaboration ignites future “opportunities to collaborate with Honda to advance fully self-driving technology and make our roads safer,” with hopes to add Honda’s vehicles instilled with GOOGL technology to the existing fleet already under evaluation throughout four U.S. cities.", "Waymo (Google/Alphabet) & Honda Collaborating On Self-Driving Tech\n\nDecember 25th, 2016 by James Ayre\n\nWaymo, the now independent self-driving vehicle technology arm of Google (well, technically, Alphabet), is now in formal talks with Honda about a potential partnership, according to recent reports.\n\nSuch a partnership would be an addition to Waymo’s already close ties with Fiat-Chrysler — ties which are demonstrated well in the recently revealed self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrids that we reported on last week.\n\nAs far as a partnerships with Honda, it would reportedly function similarly to the one with a Fiat-Chrysler, whereby Waymo supplies self-driving software and sensors to be used in and integrated with Honda vehicles (with the help of engineers from the auto manufacturer).\n\nA press release from Honda notes:\n\nHonda R&D Co., Ltd., the R&D subsidiary of Honda Motor Co., Ltd., announced today that it is entering into formal discussions with Waymo, an independent company of Alphabet Inc., to integrate its self-driving technology with Honda vehicles. This technical collaboration between Honda researchers and Waymo’s self-driving technology team would allow both companies to learn about the integration of Waymo’s fully self-driving sensors, software and computing platform into Honda vehicles.\n\nAs part of the discussion on technical collaboration, Honda could initially provide Waymo with vehicles modified to accommodate Waymo’s self-driving technology. These vehicles would join Waymo’s existing fleet, which are currently being tested across four U.S. cities.\n\nIf both parties agree to enter into a formal agreement, Honda R&D engineers based in Silicon Valley, California and Tochigi, Japan, would work closely with Waymo engineers based in Mountain View, California and Novi, Michigan.\n\nHonda previously announced its intention to put production vehicles with automated driving capabilities on highways sometime around 2020 related to its goal of a collision-free society. In addition to these on-going efforts, this technical collaboration with Waymo could allow Honda R&D to explore a different technological approach to bring fully self-driving technology to market. These discussions are an initial step that will allow Waymo and Honda R&D to further explore the potential of a broad range of automated driving technologies.\n\nAs alluded to above, Waymo recently received the first 100 autonomous Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans developed with Fiat-Chrysler engineers and active testing of the vehicles is now underway. While it’s hard to tell exactly where Waymo’s technology is, the move to independence and the growing partnerships with established auto manufacturers suggests that they probably aren’t far away from the goal of fully autonomous-driving tech.\n\nBuy a cool T-shirt or mug in the CleanTechnica store!\n\n\n\nKeep up to date with all the hottest cleantech news by subscribing to our (free) cleantech daily newsletter or weekly newsletter, or keep an eye on sector-specific news by getting our (also free) solar energy newsletter, electric vehicle newsletter, or wind energy newsletter.\n\n", "Google's Waymo to show self-driving Pacifica at Detroit auto show\n\nWaymo, Google's new autonomous-technology unit, will debut its self-driving Chrysler Pacifica at the Detroit auto show.\n\nThe minivan, co-developed with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in a plan to deploy a fleet of 100 autonomous vehicles, will be displayed on stage during Waymo CEO John Krafcik's keynote address on Jan. 8, as part of the Automobili-D event happening the day before the North American International Auto Show's media days begin.\n\nIn a tweet Tuesday, Krafcik said he will discuss the vehicle and details of what Waymo has been working on since October 2015, when it completed the first driverless ride on public roads without a steering wheel or brake pedal.\n\nWe'll talk about what we've been up to since completing the world's first truly self-driving trip https://t.co/1M2JJo4EOC #NAIAS — John Krafcik (@johnkrafcik) December 20, 2016\n\nWaymo published photos of the minivans on Monday, adding that it plans to have the vehicles on public roads by 2017.\n\nWaymo was formerly known as Google's self-driving car project, which was spun off as a standalone company under the Alphabet umbrella.\n\n- Automotive News is a Crain Communications Inc. publication.\n\nRelated Links" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.02242647058823529, 0.05452380952380952, 0.1036363636363636 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4018382352941176, 0.3948809523809524, 0.2354545454545454 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-23T00:00:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2016-12-25T00:00:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2016-12-20T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

Also, the search engine giant has said that it would develop more controls for marketer and advertisers.\n\nFurthermore, the analysts noted that the ad boycott will likely to benefit traditional TV companies.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts at RBC Capital Markets and Morgan Stanley believe that the ads boycott won’t have a major impact.

The loss in advertising revenue is likely to be temporary as Google works to resolve the issue.\n\nMoreover, YouTube, if it is profitable, is likely only marginally so. Consequently, this is unlikely to materially affect earnings in any tangible form or have much in the way of long-run implications.\n\nOverview\n\nGoogle (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) had a tough week, dropping more than 4%. The decline largely came on the back of a reputational imbroglio concerning large advertisers, including many Fortune 500 companies, dropping ads from Google's YouTube platform. Advertisers became concerned that their brand's association with content that could be objectionable and inconsistent with their values would do far more harm than good.\n\nOn Friday, Google suffered more advertising defections, with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP), and Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) suspending their campaigns with all Google advertising aside from search. General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) were pulling their ads from YouTube specifically, but leaving up ads on search and other non-search Google platforms.\n\nDespite Google's attention to the issue, cleaning this up will take time. Approximately around 600,000 hours of new video is added to YouTube each day. With this level of volume growth in the platform, addressing these concerns will take a non-trivial amount of new investment into machine learning, artificial intelligence, and new engineers to implement these filters and sufficiently parse newly uploaded content for terms of service violations. Google already provides some level of brand safety control features for advertisers for non-search platforms, such as the ability to better place ads where desired.\n\nIn the short-term, the news is negative for the stock due to the reputational hit to Google as a whole and costs relevant to onboarding new engineers, time burden on management and existing personnel, and any associated investment expenses. Over the long-run it is expected that the current fallout has little substantive impact, with these measures an inevitable necessity associated with a massive, under-regulated content platform where quality control requires an additional level of technological investment and development.\n\nI believe the stock price decline comes mainly out of concerns over Google's reputational hit, with financial concerns largely secondary. The revenue-related impact is likely to be temporary. Additionally, despite the high-profile defections, these companies still likely constitute only a relatively small fraction of the advertising revenue YouTube takes in.\n\nWith Google making the commitment to review its advertising tools and policies and concentrated focus on limiting ad pairing with objectionable material, this should restrain the level of adverse shock to the segment's near-term financial performance. Once these factors are resolved, advertisers are very likely to resume their advertising partnerships with YouTube given its significant reach. Its 700 million daily visitors place it as the third-most viewed website globally.\n\nHow Much is YouTube Worth?\n\nPart of this development begs the question of how much value YouTube provides to Google in terms of revenue, EBITDA, cash flow, and, ultimately, an actual enterprise value figure.\n\nGoogle doesn't disclose YouTube's financials in its annual report (though it leaves clues regarding growth rates in paid clicks and cost-per-click). But even when including the aforementioned factors of cost, YouTube is very likely not yet a sizable contributor of revenues to Google. Earnings contributions are also likely trivial at best relative to Google's ~$20 billion in projected FY2017 profit.\n\nThat's not to say that YouTube isn't a massively valuable part of Google's business. I estimate that YouTube took in around $10.9 billion in revenue in the FY2016. To arrive at this estimate I assumed 750 billion in video ads at a CPM of $12 ($9.0 billion) and 1.1 trillion display ads at a CPM of $1.75 ($1.9 billion). Another 15%-20% annual growth would put this figure at $12.5-$13.1 billion for the FY2017.\n\nThis would place it at around 14% of Google's revenue. YouTube will continue to grow at a faster rate, but the more mature search business is higher-margined. Moreover, YouTube's margins are inherently constrained based on content acquisition costs, which consume 55% of revenue alone.\n\nWhat YouTube may lack in terms of cash flow, EBITDA, and perhaps even revenue, it makes up for in terms of its value. YouTube still has a massive amount of potential with its traffic figures of over 250 billion per year and ~1.5 billion monthly active users.\n\nIf we use Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) as a comp and apply a 7x revenue multiple to its FY2017 revenue estimate, this would imply the platform is worth around $90 billion, around 50% more than Netflix itself and around 16% of Google's market cap. This would imply YouTube itself contributes about $130 per share to Google's Class C share price.\n\nThis doesn't seem too out of line considering its ongoing growth trajectory and the fact it already has far more viewers than television.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe YouTube advertising debacle is likely a short-term hurdle for Google, both from a reputational standpoint and from the lost ad revenue and increased costs associated with fixing the issue. Technological investment into the machine learning and AI required to better facilitate quality control was a necessary step at some point to ensure the integrity of the platform and protect its merits as a valuable advertising channel.\n\nWhile it would have been ideal to accomplish this before any adverse incident arose, advertisers are likely to fully re-establish their relationship with Google once the situation is remedied. Given YouTube is not much of a cash generator for Google and is still in the process of growing into a steadily profitable franchise, this won't represent much of a hit to earnings even when considering any reputational reverberations in other parts of the business." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1447751322751323, 0.08524051546203446 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.5447089947089947, 0.5366650227409722 ], "publish_date" : [ null, { "$date" : "2017-03-26T07:00:58.000+0000" } ] }

Since hitting a low near $812 on Feb. 1, GOOGL stock has steadily bounced back, regaining more than 3% of the ground it lost following a poorly received fourth-quarter earnings report.\n\nBut you haven’t missed out on the fun. Alphabet stock still has some gas in the tank.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge Alphabet’s bounce from the $812 region was not happenstance. The shares were bolstered by support from their rising 50-day moving average, and a wealth of psychological support from the nearby $800 area. Furthermore, GOOGL stock has been in rally mode since mid-2015, gaining some 53% during this time frame.\n\nIn other words, the post-earnings dip was less about poor quarterly results and more about an excuse to take some profits off the table.\n\nHowever, now that the situation has corrected itself, and Alphabet stock has emerged from an overbought situation, shares should be poised to run higher.\n\nIf you took my bullish GOOGL recommendation on Jan. 31 and got into the March $830/$850 bull call spread, you are likely already at breakeven or sitting on a profit for the trade. What’s more, the odds of breaking out above $850 have improved significantly in the past couple of weeks.\n\nAlternately, if you took the more neutral-to-bullish option and entered the March $800 put sell, you can all but rest easy now that GOOGL stock is headed higher once again.\n\nIf you missed out on those trades, though, there’s still time to get in before Alphabet Inc tops out again.\n\nSentiment for Alphabet remains as bullish as ever, with nearly all of the 48 analysts tracked by Thomson/First Call rating GOOGL stock a “buy.” Additionally, the 12-month price target has risen over the past month to $990.72, and that bodes well for the shares going forward, as it cuts down on the likelihood of downgrades to “hold” over the short-term.\n\nAs for options traders, a bit of caution has crept into GOOGL options since Alphabet’s quarterly report, but this, too, is healthy for the shares. Currently, the March put/call open interest ratio rests at 0.76, up from pre-earnings readings near 0.85.\n\nFurthermore, peak March call OI rests well overhead at $900, meaning that Alphabet should see little in the way of potential options-related resistance.\n\nNext Page" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.0677854938271605 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3904320987654322 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-02-14T13:15:33.000+0000" } ] }

That’s because there are around 70,000 autopilot-enabled Tesla cars on the road.\n\nCritics have pointing to moves by traditional automakers like General Motors Company’s (NYSE: GM ) acquisition of Cruise Automation, and Tesla’s Autopilot, among others, as proof that GOOGL is now in the back seat. A report from earlier this year on how Toyota Motor Corp (ADR)(NYSE: TM ) had the highest number of patents related to self-driving cars also helped them buttress their points.\n\nAfter all, Toyota had over a thousand patents as of when the report was published, while GOOGL only had a few hundred patents. However, what’s not being said is that the patents Alphabet holds are mostly related to Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-Infrastructure (V2I) technologies.\n\nNext Page", "Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV announced the production of 100 Pacifica Hybrid minivans which will join Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo self-driving vehicle fleet.\n\nThe minivans are currently being being outfitted with fully self-driving technology, including purpose-built computers and a suite of sensors, telematics and other systems, and will become part of the test fleet of Waymo, formerly the Google car project, in early 2017, the Italian-American manufacturer said Monday in a statement.\n\nWaymo Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan Source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles\n\nFiat Chrysler, the first major automaker to strike a deal with Alphabet’s Google for autonomous vehicles, has favored cooperating with tech giants to navigate potentially profound changes in the car industry.

The included sensitivity analysis lets readers see the result of the model using modified assumptions.\n\nNote: I invite you to read my original article that outlines the DCF sensitivity analysis methodology. The basic idea is that since the results of a DCF analysis can be heavily skewed by making minor changes to the terminal growth rate or firm's cost of equity, I have used a range of long-term growth rates and discount [cost of equity] rates in my analysis below. By using one's own estimate of long-term growth and an appropriate discount rate, each individual investor can come up with their own target price for the security in question.\n\nTo begin, the past five years of key company data are outlined below:\n\nAlphabet's consistently strong profit margins translate into an average Operating Cash Flow to Revenue Ratio of over 35%. The company has always been known as one willing to spend money on research and development with the goal of continuing to innovate. This strategy shows up in a fairly high CapEx to Revenue Ratio of approximately 12%. The DCF model assumes that these figures will remain constant moving forward, even though it seems likely that the CapEx/Revenue Ratio peaked in 2014 and may continue to fall in the coming years.\n\nUsing the analyst consensus revenue forecasts for 2017 and 2018 (source: Yahoo! Finance) leads to the following pro-forma free cash flow [FCF] projection. While analysts expect nearly 18% revenue growth in 2017 and 16% the following year, the model uses a conservative 2% long-term growth rate. Sales growth is projected to slow in a linear fashion from almost 16% in 2018 to 2% in 2022. One can reasonably argue that this estimate is overly pessimistic, but given how quickly Internet trends have changed in the past, using a conservative projection here is the prudent choice.\n\nThese free cash flows (along with a terminal free cash flow estimate) are then discounted back to the present time using Alphabet's projected cost of equity. Various different estimates of its beta are available depending on the time frame used, but as per my explanation in this article, the \"adjusted beta\" of the stock was calculated to be 0.74. Based on a 8% market risk premium and risk free rate of 2.5%, Alphabet's discount rate is estimated to be 8.4% (and rounded up to 8.5% in the base case). If you feel like a higher discount rate is warranted, you can see how changing that variable impacts the results of the model in the sensitivity analysis at the end of the article.\n\nAfter adjusting for Alphabet's significant cash holdings and both classes of outstanding shares, the model gives a target price of $1057, which is more than 25% above the most recent closing price of the Class A shares [GOOGL]:\n\nHowever, my favorite part of this DCF model is the sensitivity analysis. The below table allows the reader to view the results of 35 different iterations of the model using a range of long-term growth estimates and discount rates. The target prices range from $706 to $1,574 - the cells highlighted in red are more than 10% below the current share price, while those highlighted in green are more than 10% above the current share price:\n\nThe above table demonstrates that even with a discount rate as high as 10.5%, Alphabet's shares appear undervalued if it can achieve at least 2% long-term revenue growth.\n\nHowever, I decided to re-run the DCF model after making a pair of modifications to make the projections even more conservative:\n\nTo reflect the possibility that increasing competition lowers Alphabet's margins, the Operating Cash Flow to Revenue Ratio was lowered by 3% from 35.6% to 32.6%. Based on this article, which estimates 60% of Alphabet's cash in held overseas and subject to taxation, the net cash balance was reduced by $15 billion to reflect the potential future tax liability.\n\nUsing the same 2% long-term growth rate and 8.5% cost of equity, the model's target price is now $912 - down meaningfully from the previous scenario, but still more than 5% above Alphabet's current share price. Below is an updated sensitivity to reflect the pair of changes made above:\n\nA discounted cash flow analysis (like any other type of security analysis) is full of uncertainty. However, by including two different types of sensitivity analysis (70 results in total), I hope that I have provided some reasonable estimates for the present value of Alphabet's future equity cash flows.\n\nThe company is still growing quickly, generates significant free cash flow and has a solid balance sheet flush with cash. For these reasons, my DCF model suggests that Alphabet shares currently represent a compelling opportunity.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in GOOG over the next 72 hours.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

But is it time to buy GOOGL stock’s pullback? Let’s take a look at what’s behind the price action, the technical picture and a limited-risk options strategy on Alphabet to better navigate the environment.\n\nThe consensus view earlier this year had been any political risks facing Alphabet would surely be coming out of China or from Capitol Hill. But it was a problem from across the pond and from our European neighbors in the U.K. that sent shares of GOOGL tumbling this week.\n\nFor the weekly period, shares of Alphabet are off about 4% after influential foreign ad buyers lashed out about how their ads had been placed alongside terrorist and other extremism media on Google’s YouTube. For its part, Alphabet is taking action and looking to improve its “brand safety controls.”\n\nImprovements aren’t happening soon enough for some though. Earlier this week, as Barron’s noted, France’s Havas SA, the world’s sixth largest marketing agency, stated it had pulled the plug on all client advertising in the U.K. from both YouTube and the Google Display Network.\n\nAnd now American companies are joining the ranks in protest as well.\n\nIn the interim and while the controversy plays out with bulls like Pacific Crest and bears, or at least alarmists, chiming in, we can take a visual look at how things are playing out in GOOGL stock.\n\nGOOGL Stock Daily Chart\n\nJust prior to this week’s sudden and volatile bout of profit-taking, GOOGL stock had been making all the right technical moves. Since the beginning of 2017, shares of Alphabet managed to successfully clear the prior all-time highs, rally, establish a successful test of support and then proceed to even higher highs.\n\nNow — despite the quick drop of around 4% this week — our view is Alphabet could be setting up as a pullback entry. For the more quick-fingered among us, the hammering of shares by Thursday’s close actually formed a bullish hammer low.\n\nNext Page", "Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was slapped with a rare downgrade on Monday as Pivotal Research Group's Brian Wieser lowered his rating on the stock to Hold from Buy with a price target lowered to $950 from a previous $970 due to ongoing concerns in the United Kingdom.\n\nAccording to U.K.-based Daily Mail, several notable local brands, including retail giant Marks & Spencer, are no longer going to advertise on Google's YouTube platform. Companies have concerns that their brand image is being shown alongside content from extremist channels and groups, including neo-Nazi and even jihadist groups.\n\nGlobal Repercussions\n\nAccording to Wieser, Alphabet's Google unit faces brand safety issues in the United Kingdom, but this can have global repercussions. The analyst expanded that ad quality and brand safety represent the biggest issues facing the advertising agency. In addition, advertisers are effectively putting money in the pockets of terror and extremist groups.\n\nGoogle has since apologized and pledged to fix the problem by improving controls it gives advertisers and working faster to remove hateful content. However, Wieser argued that the approach isn't enough to remedy concerns.\n\n\"The approach comes across to us as attempting to minimize the problem rather than eliminating it, which is the standard we think that many large brand advertisers expect,\" the analyst argued. \"We think that Google will probably need to articulate goals that sound more like a zero tolerance policy, to alleviate concerns before it can fully recover.\"\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe analyst also suggested that U.K. marketers could expand their local boycott of advertising on Google's platform to other global markets which prompted the analyst to lower his full-year revenue estimate for Alphabet by one percent point. In addition, Wieser noted that Alphabet's recent run up now puts the stock well within the 15 percent band he uses to justify a Buy rating.\n\nRelated Link:\n\nWhen It Comes To Discovering New Tunes, AM/FM Radio Still Trumps Streaming Services\n\nYouTube TV Joins Growing Field, But Has Better Features\n\nLatest Ratings for GOOG Date Firm Action From To Jan 2017 Pacific Crest Reinstates Overweight Jul 2016 JP Morgan Maintains Overweight Apr 2016 Deutsche Bank Maintains Buy View More Analyst Ratings for GOOG\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nPosted-In: Analyst Color Long Ideas Reiteration Analyst Ratings Movers Tech Media Trading Ideas Best of Benzinga\n\n© 2017 Benzinga.com.

All rights reserved.", "After the initial head fake sell off following Q4 results, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) appears poised for the rally to $1,000. A reporting change announced with the Q4 results appeared to have spooked the market.\n\nThe stock quickly sold off following solid numbers and trading relatively cheap. Though Alphabet has rallied back to all-time highs suggesting investors have officially spoken on the issue of GAAP versus non-GAAP numbers for good reason.\n\nQ1 Shift\n\nOn the Q4 earnings call, CFO Ruth Porat made the following disclosure that surely surprised the market:\n\nMy suggestion is that the $40 dip in the stock was over some initial panic that Alphabet was no longer going to retain value if the EPS dips. After all, the stock-based compensation is a large amount of the quarterly EPS totals.\n\nFor Q4, Alphabet had $1.8 billion in SBC charges, up from $1.4 billion last year. For all of 2016, the SBC charges were an incredible $6.7 billion. Remember though that the share count grew by 3.2 million shares over last Q4 and accounts for the SBC within the EPS calculation.\n\nSource: Alphabet Q416 earnings release\n\nAfter a week or so, the market shook off this irrational sell off. In reality, the value of the stock is not altered at all whether Alphabet changes the reporting. The key cash flows won't change and including the SBC charges in the diluted EPS number is duplicative.\n\nThe real impact to the company is higher share counts. The accounting rationale for the charge is to derive the effectiveness of management and to factor in the cost of the issuance of shares for compensation.\n\nThe number though is included in the EPS that includes the share count. Investors looking at cash flows won't include the SBC charge any way and this explains the stock rebounded to close at an all-time high over $872.\n\nGAAP Vs. Non-GAAP\n\nRegardless of what the company does with reporting, investors can value the stock either way. The interesting part is how the stock is reported by different financial sites that report the EPS numbers.\n\nYahoo Finance is clearly shifting towards using the GAAP numbers. The 2017 EPS estimates have dipped over the last 60 days to only $33.41 from $41.11.\n\nSource: Yahoo Finance\n\nConversely, YCharts is still using the non-GAAP numbers for EPS estimates. The charts show a 2017 EPS estimate of $41.63 and $48.66 for 2018.\n\nGOOGL EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\n\nUsing the traditional non-GAAP numbers, Alphabet is only trading at a forward P/E multiple of 17.9. To reach the magical $1,000 mark, the stock would only trade at a P/E multiple of 20.6.\n\nTakeaway\n\nThe key investor takeaway is that Alphabet appears ready to break out towards $1,000. The stock could face a jolt when reporting Q1 results towards the end of April that doesn't include non-GAAP EPS numbers excluding SBC.\n\nEither way, investors would be wise to ignore the noise surrounding the official reporting of these numbers and load up on any irrational dips." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.09577572964669739, 0.1901244588744589, 0.1321560846560847 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3147721454173067, 0.385930735930736, 0.4722751322751322 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-24T17:40:05.000+0000" }, null, { "$date" : "2017-03-20T16:22:41.000+0000" } ] }

The brokerage firm also waxed optimistic on, saying the company is \"extremely well positioned,\" and cited \"enthusiasm among its advertisers\" over changes to its core search. However, at least one analyst more recently expressed reservations about the Google Pixel smartphone.Specifically, Flurry Analytics looked at the most popular smartphone brands in the week leading up to Christmas. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was in the lead thanks to its iPhone, followed by Samsung, Huawei, and LG. However, GOOGL was noticeably absent. \"With only two devices, the Pixel and Pixel XL, and mixed market reception, Google struggled to drum up excitement this holiday season,\" Flurry opined.This isn't the only space in which Alphabet has struggled to win supporters. In the options pits, too, trading activity has tilted in an unusually bearish direction. The stock's 10-day put/call volume ratio of 0.91 at the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) sits just 1 percentage point from a 12-month peak. Echoing this, GOOGL's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 0.97 ranks in the top quartile of all readings from the past year.Whether bullish or bearish, short-term options traders can score a bargain at the moment. GOOGL's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 17% sits at an annual low. In other words, options in the front three-months' series are pricing in extremely low volatility expectations.Technically speaking, though, there hasn't been much to see on the charts. For the past five months, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been chopping sideways around the $800 level, last seen at $800.79. In fact, the post-election boost that most stocks have seen hasn't benefited GOOGL shares, which are actually lower relative to their Nov. 8 close.\n\nSign up now for Schaeffer's Market Recap to get all the day's big stock movers, must-know technical levels, and top economic stories straight to your inbox.", "Although the euphoric phase of smartwatch mania has come and gone, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) is in the unusual position of just now getting serious about the market.\n\nSource: Brad Moon\n\nIt’s launching not one but two second-generation Android-powered, wrist-worn devices in early 2017.\n\nOther manufacturers are also expected to unveil smartwatches based on the Android operating system during the coming year, distinguishing its smartwatch business model from the one employed by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Only Apple makes smartwatches that utilize the iOS operating system.\n\nWill Alphabet do what Apple wasn’t able to do, which is measurably improve the value of GOOGL stock by tapping into the relatively new category of consumer technology?\n\nMaybe, but if it does, it’s going to take a massive paradigm shift that hasn’t even come close to taking shape yet.\n\nNumbers Don’t Lie\n\nMost owners of GOOGL stock may not even realize that Google actually beat Apple to the smartwatch market by launching one in 2014. Indeed, that’s a key tenet of the problem. If people don’t realize Alphabet makes such a device already, it’s because the company has done a poor job of marketing itself.\n\nFortunately for Alphabet shareholders, this shouldn’t be an impasse with the upcoming unveilings.\n\nUnfortunately, better marketing and more consumer familiarity with the idea of wearables isn’t going to help much.\n\nSee, the smartwatch market is not a significant market for companies that drive tens of billions of dollars worth of revenue per year selling goods and services other than smartwatches. As of the most recent tally, only 39.5 million U.S. adults are expected to be smartwatch users by the end of the year. Initial estimates from a year ago said that figure would be 63.7 million.\n\nFor comparison, as of the end of last year, 68% of the nation’s 242 million adults own smartphones. That’s 164 million smartphone owners, most of whom just don’t see the advantage of yet another piece of technology on their person.\n\nWe’re seeing comparable metrics on a global basis.\n\nWhat’s It Going to Take?\n\nTo answer the overarching question of marketability, look at the feedback consumers have served up about the Apple Watch and other smartwatches. Each device has some rabid fan because … well, there’s always someone who finds something to love about anything. But some of the criticisms have been repeatedly voiced.\n\nNext Page", "Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has long been a favorite of option traders due to its high share price and juicy option premiums. With the stock trading at $804, it has basically gone nowhere since late-2015.\n\nWith a massive technological revolution currently taking place, Alphabet is well placed to take advantage of potential boom industries in self-driving cars and virtual reality.\n\nAmigobulls recently reported that “self-driving cars could actually come sooner than many people think”, due to recent regulations introduced by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.\n\nOn December 14, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s self-driving technology efforts became an official company called Waymo, which stands for a new way forward in mobility.\n\nCompetition in the self-driving car space is already pretty fierce, with Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) leading the charge, but Alphabet and Waymo still have potential to grab a significant share of the market.\n\nWaymo plans to focus on working with auto manufacturers to provide the tech, rather than building their own cars. This seems sensible given tech is their area of expertise rather than car making.\n\nIn addition to self-driving cards, the virtual reality market is set to heat up over the next few years. Forbes recently listed Alphabet as one of 11 stocks to watch in this $80 billion market.\n\nThe article reported that Alphabet is “already building a new version of Glass and has secretly distributed the product to health care, manufacturing and energy companies.”\n\nLooking at the charts, while Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is basically at the same level it was a year ago, it has had a nice run up since July. After consolidating since August, the stock could look to push above the 52 week high at $840 sometime in early 2017.\n\nOptions traders can take advantage of a bullish stance in Alphabet by trading bull put spreads.\n\nIf trader were willing to bet that GOOGL will stay above $800 between now and March they could sell a March 17th, 2017 $800-$790 spread.\n\nFor selling that spread, they would receive $410 in option premium. The maximum loss would occur if GOOGL traded below $790 on the expiry date. The maximum loss would be $590.\n\nTherefore, traders will to bet on a table to higher GOOGL share price between now and March could receive a juicy 69% return on their investment.\n\nFollow Alphabet Inc.

(GOOGL) a Powerful Ad Authority" ], "article_text" : [ "Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the parent company of Google, the undisputed leader of online search and digital advertising. Its dominance hasn’t gone unnoticed by investors, who have bid the shares up towards their all-time highs.\n\nYet Google is no moonshot, which is the term it has used to describe the venture capital activities in its “Other Bets” segment. This includes self-driving cars and its Nest franchise, which actually has some sales and helps consumers more efficiently heat and cool their homes.\n\nThe question for investors going forward is if Alphabet can continue to dominate online advertising. It and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) controlled 50% of the $60 billion online ad market in 2015. Google controlled half of the market, or $30 billion. Facebook’s take was $8 billion, but is also growing rapidly.\n\nGOOG Stock Isn’t Stopping\n\nAlphabet’s sales growth has been meteoric. It is projected to report sales of nearly $90 billion for all of 2016 (the final year results have yet to be fully reported) and that should jump to above $100 billion this year (calendar 2017). That will mark a roughly 10-fold increase from the $10.6 billion it reported in 2006.\n\nExtrapolating those figures out another decade, Alphabet stands a chance at generating over $1 trillion in revenue. That is certainly a tall order, but the network effect (where a product or service grows more valuable as more people use it) is proving to be one of the greatest growth drivers capitalism has ever seen.\n\nOf course, there is a downside to such dominance. The European Union has been attacking Google, alleging it is abusing its dominant position to block out competition and keep internet surfers dependent on its services. Specifically, it has suggested that Google pushes hard to make its search engine the default on smart phones and computers. It’s not always easy being on top.\n\nThe worries over Google’s dominance echo the control Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) held over personal computers back in the 1990s. In similar fashion, the U.S. Justice Department accused Microsoft of using its personal computing software dominance to push its Internet Explorer internet browser, which helped end the Netscape browser era that helped pioneer online search and browsing the world wide web.\n\nGoogle’s dominance won’t last forever, but there is little reason to see it going away any time soon. In the next two years, analysts see earnings growing at a mid-teens percentage rate to above $41 per share for all of this year. It is a huge beneficiary of the growth in everything digital as consumers increasingly shop and socialize online.\n\nNext Page", "GOOGL stock is currently undervalued when compared to its peers, but that could change in 2017.\n\nAlphabet stock underperformed the market by a significant margin in 2016.\n\nThis can be attributed to investors worrying about Google's declining margins and rising costs.\n\nThis might however, change once investors start focusing more on the company's growth outlook.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock badly underperformed the market in 2016, finishing with a modest return of just 2% vs. 11% by the S&P 500. More notably, GOOGL stock underperformed its FANG counterparts consisting of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), with all but Netflix finishing the year with double-digit gains. The stock appears to have taken a breather after rallying hard - 45% over the previous 2 years.\n\nGOOGL stock is undervalued\n\nWhile GOOGL stock has underperformed, Alphabet has continued posting strong top and bottom line growth, and the shares now look undervalued. At a valuation of 10 times EBITDA versus 19.2 times for Amazon and 13.5 times for Facebook, the shares look cheaper than what the company's growth calls for, suggesting the market has not fully priced-in Google's strong growth.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, the underperformance by GOOG stock can be chalked up to Alphabet's deteriorating core margins and investors focusing on deleveraging of traffic acquisition costs. Alphabet's operating margin has fallen sharply from 35.4% in 2010 to 26.3% currently. Margins have been eroding due to falling CPCs (Cost Per Click) and rising traffic acquisition costs.\n\nGoogle's Cost-Per-Click has continued declining due to the increasing exposure to international markets. More than half the company's revenue comes from international markets, where lower ad pricing and adverse effects of a strong dollar are major headwinds. Meanwhile, Google's search ads form the bulk of its revenue and command better prices than display ads on platforms like YouTube due to higher engagement rates. Unfortunately, Google's search business is becoming increasingly saturated making it harder for search CPC to improve.\n\nAlso Read: Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL) Next Growth Cycle Is Closer Than You Think\n\nGoogle's increasing traffic acquisition costs, or TAC, have also been pressuring margins. TAC refers to the fees the company pays to partner websites that run Google ads. The portion of TAC that Google pays to distribution partners to make its search engine the default option on rival platforms such as the iOS on iPhones jumped 33% during the last quarter, much higher than the top line growth of 20%. Google says this trend is due to the fact that its strongest growth areas, including mobile and programmatic advertising, naturally have higher TAC.\n\nWhy these concerns are overblown\n\nIt appears as if investors have been overreacting and missing the forest for the trees. Google remains by far the most dominant ad company with good growth runways. During the past few quarters, revenue growth has been accelerating, a remarkable feat for a company its size. Indeed, Google stock has kicked off the year on a strong note after racking up gains of 4.7% in the first two weeks of trading. That's better than the 1.6% gained by the S&P 500, but worse than Facebook's 9.6%, Amazon's 6.6%, and Netflix's 5.4% over the timeframe.\n\nMeanwhile, Google websites and new initiatives like the Pixel remain in the pink of health. Google derives 80% of its revenue from its own websites rather than partner sites. And the good news is that revenue on Google websites has consistently been growing much faster than AdSense revenue from partner sites. During the last quarter, Google websites brought in revenue of $16,089 million, up 23% Y/Y, while Google's partner revenue was $3,732 million, up a mere 1%. The huge disparity in growth rates could be the result of Google cracking down hard on low-quality sites that try to game marketers by offering search spam. But it also has a more nuanced side: Google is increasingly relying less and less on partner sites for its revenue, meaning its TAC is likely to remain under control.\n\nMeanwhile, Pixel has been one of the company's most successful hardware innovations. Morgan Stanley estimates the company will sell ~6 million units in 2017, bringing in $4 billion in revenue and $900 million in gross profit. 6 million units pale in comparison with what Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) manages with the iPhone - more than 200 million units sold in 2016. $4 billion might also not look like much for a company with annual revenue of nearly $80 billion. Yet, the Pixel is an important part of Alphabet because it's actually the only non-search segment that's profitable. Alphabet's ''Other Bets'' have been growing too slowly, while posting huge losses and acting as a big drag on the company's bottom line.

Pixel might not grow into the iPhone-killer it was originally hyped to become, but it's likely to lead to materially faster revenue and profit growth for Alphabet in the coming years.\n\nThe bottom line on GOOGL stock\n\nInvestors have been focusing too much on the finer details of Alphabet's growth metrics and in the process missing the bigger picture. But with the company's growth on an uptick and the shares looking significantly undervalued, it's only a matter of time before the market rewards GOOGL stock investors. With earnings projected to grow at nearly 18% in 2017, double-digit gains for Google stock might be on the cards.\n\nLooking for great tech stocks?

The video sharing giant –owned by Google’s parent entity, Alphabet Inc. (“NASDAQ”:“GOOGL”) — is among the best scorers of internet traffic around the world. However, this alone is not what makes the site a gold mine for advertisers. Instead, it is the platform’s content creators, or YouTube Stars, that are known to draw countless viewers to the website every day.\n\nToday, LearnBonds takes an in-depth look at why YouTube and its vast community of content creators are the best option for anyone seeking more exposure for themselves or their brand. We will land on a few leading YouTube Stars and look at the great living they can make off the site. We’ll also find out why these people are so sought after to be the faces of brands and their products.\n\nPersonality pockets online cash\n\nEva Gutowski is one of the near countless YouTube personalities who have made huge names for themselves on the platform. Her story is more or less the same as the rest. The 22-year old began making YouTube videos back in college. Today, she has more than 7.5 million subscribers who can tune in to view her content when she uploads.\n\nIn the beginning, Gutowski only saw YouTube as a decent way to help her journalism major gain some exposure. Nearly five years since then, her channel, MyLifeAsEva, has pushed her to heights she never imagined. The young woman is now working on a book, has millions of dedicated fans, and is set to get her own web show on YouTube’s premium Red platform.\n\nGutowski is not alone in this. Numerous individuals have found their fame and fortune on YouTube as well. Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube personalities have landed great business opportunities and even networks deals with the likes of Netflix, HBO and a series on other networks.\n\nTo see a list of high yielding CDs go here\n\nIt is reported that a large number of the platform’s top stars make up to $15 million a year. That doesn’t come from ad revenue alone though. Much of every major YouTuber’s income is derived from deals with certain brands. Entities are known to pay a hefty sum for content creators to plug products on their channels.\n\nBrand heaven\n\nInternet celebs bring in well over 170 million unique viewers per month to Alphabet’s (“NASDAQ”:“GOOGL”) platforms. Video sites, like YouTube, are steadily becoming every brand’s best choice for ensured growth.\n\nIt’s true, YouTube personalities are highly sought-after by any organization in search of some great brand promotion. Ask any millennial about their favorite YouTube star today. They are likely pull out a smartphone and have you spend the next twenty minutes ogling through a number of their most adored videos.\n\nThis is where YouTube’s promotional charm lies. It is unlike the rigid and mass-based, blanket coverage of billboards and T.V. ads. YouTube content is shareable, promotable and can be tied to a specific target market. It has been repeatedly proven that getting a popular content creator to promote a specific product or service usually leads to a large increase in that item’s purchase.\n\nPaul Verna of New York analyst firm eMarketer explains the reason behind this. “When you enlist an influencer to market your product, you get an audience that is very well disposed to that influencer’s opinions because they are fans.”\n\nSo a popular fitness star on YouTube can be assigned to promote a specific fitness brand. As opposed to blanket coverage, organizations can rest assured that they’re reaching fitness-oriented people who sympathize with the star’s views.\n\nYouTube is more than point and shoot\n\nIt is not just personality and content, it takes some technical expertise as well.\n\nIn this video, Sean Cannell of Video Influencers reports on what it takes to succeed on YouTube.\n\n“In order to be discovered on YouTube you have to figure out what your desired audience is searching for and then get your videos to show up in the top search results around those terms, Cannell explains.\n\nMore brands flock to associate themselves with Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube and its arsenal of diverse personalities in orders to promote their products.

Followed shortly after by that bombshell CNBC interview (here's the transcript), where he revealed an $18 billion plus Apple investment*, the vast majority bought by him in January and recent months (and the rest by Todd and Ted in early-2016). What better confirmation of my assertion that value investors - even the greatest of them all, at 86 years of age - would be wise to pose such a question to themselves?\n\n[*Pretty sure Apple is Buffett's largest common stock investment ever (on a cost basis). In fact, I wonder if it's the largest stock investment ever made by a single investor (again, in terms of cost)? Sure, Todd, Ted, and Charlie did provide some inspiration and feedback here, but we can be sure Buffett never buys anything until he makes his own mind up! Thoughts?]\n\nGranted, I got lucky.\n\nWas I confident I'd see Buffett talking up an Apple position just weeks later? Um, no. [Don't forget, Icahn announcing a multi-billion holding some years back was a huge surprise too.] And maybe I chose it specifically as the largest, most obvious and controversial value stock out there. Not to mention, the head fake I pulled: While I did summarize its attractive fundamentals and valuation, my post clearly wasn't intended to be a detailed thesis. But hey, it was still the right question at the right time, so I'll take the kudos! And Buffett's purchase now serves as great inspiration to present a genuinely compelling investment thesis here. Just not Apple - I mean, who even needs a thesis right now when Buffett has put so much money where his mouth is? Instead, we'll focus on a company which is arguably the antithesis of Apple - therefore, I ask:\n\nSo Why Not Google It?\n\nYeah, it's Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG). While the new holding company moniker isn't so recognizable, almost everybody on the planet interacts with its products on a daily basis - Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Google Play and Gmail each have over 1 billion monthly active users! Obviously, no introduction is needed here, but if you haven't read them recently, I recommend two key documents: 'An Owner's Manual' for Google Shareholders, from the 2004 IPO (inspired by Buffett), plus the Alphabet Letter, which details the 2015 transition to a holding company for Google and Other Bets (again, inspired by Buffett). Note particularly the core 'mission statement':\n\n'Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.'\n\nBut while we may love Google's story and products, many haven't considered it any more seriously as an investment than Apple. You know why - in no particular order: It's a technology company, it's a technology company that's totally dependent on advertising revenues, its costs-per-click keep falling, many of its products and services have completely bombed, its talent could and probably will walk out the door tomorrow, it's throwing money away on moonshots, it could be superseded by a better mouse-trap tomorrow, its CFO is an over-compensated innovation killer, it's sitting on mountains of idle cash, its dual-share structure is evil, it belongs in the too-difficult pile, it's a black box, who knows, etc.\n\nIn reality, that list tells you as much about the biases of investors themselves - such objections aren't necessarily correct, or even grounded in facts and figures. Which we'd do well to focus on - here's the last decade of Alphabet/Google results, complete with 5 and 10 year CAGRs:\n\nFocusing on the last 5 years, revenue growth has slowed marginally, but nobody could fail to be impressed by the consistent top-line growth of 19% per annum. Unfortunately, non-GAAP operating margins have failed to expand as one might expect - in fact, they've gone into reverse, declining from 36% to 34%. Which is exacerbated by a progressively more generous stock-based compensation policy in the last few years. [Stock-based compensation, or SBC.] Taken together, GAAP operating margin has grown 15% pa. And like most technology companies, stock issuance along the way leaves diluted and excluding-SBC diluted EPS growth at 13-14% pa. Which is not to be sneezed at in a post-crisis world.\n\nBut if you weren't an Apple fan (despite its earnings trajectory), you just might hate Alphabet - which boasts lower 5-10 year earnings growth, yet manages to enjoy a far higher multiple! At today's $868.39 share price, Alphabet trades on a 25.3 non-GAAP P/E (based on 2016 ex-SBC diluted EPS of $34.34). And if that turns you off, doubtless you'll focus on the much higher 31.2 GAAP P/E (based on diluted EPS of $27.85). Of course, more adventurous growth investors wouldn't even blink at such numbers. But for the average value investor, on the face of it, these P/Es are likely way too steep to even consider (in absolute, relative, and/or PEG ratio terms).\n\nBut such a conclusion could be a huge missed opportunity.\n\nWe need to survey the company through different lens - focusing instead on three distinct components of Alphabet's corporate empire, while making one additional but critical accounting adjustment, to apprehend a more realistic picture of the company's performance, prospects, and underlying fair value. First, we have:\n\nA Ton of Cash and Investments:\n\nToo many investors discount cash, while also over-estimating the advantages of debt. [Look at any great growth story, debt is not the driver!]. But a strong balance sheet may permit a more aggressive and longer-term strategy in a company's existing business, whilst also retaining a free option on future growth opportunities. Conversely, an over-leveraged company may quickly find its horizons limited and its options eliminated. Of course, discounting cash (and investments) may still be warranted, if management is intent on: i) building a permanent cushion of idle cash, and/or ii) pursuing illogical and value-destroying acquisitions/investments (or has a history of such indulgence). I don't believe investors face these risks with Alphabet.\n\nIn terms of internal investment, Google is the answer - from a single web page, Larry Page and Sergey Brin built a search and advertising colossus from scratch! While also presiding over an acquisition machine, with 200 plus acquisitions since day one. [And here's a fascinating Google timeline.] Notably, the majority of deals have focused on acquiring talent, technology, and intellectual property - not on existing revenues and profits - to support and build on existing businesses, and to expand into related fields. But surveying some of the largest deals, they've been total block-busters: Android in 2005 (for just $50 million), YouTube in 2006 ($1.65 billion), DoubleClick ($3.1 billion) & AdMob ($0.75 billion) in 2007/2009. As for Waze in 2013 ($1 billion), and Nest Labs in 2014 ($3.2 billion), it's still too early to tell.\n\nAnd Alphabet's largest deal, $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility in 2011, was also notable: First, it wasn't the failure some have tagged it. Motorola had almost $3 billion of cash at the time, Motorola Home was sold for $2.4 billion, then Motorola Mobility for another $2.9 billion, while deferred tax assets appear to have more than offset interim operating losses. And so, apparently as intended all along, Alphabet effectively acquired Motorola's entire patent portfolio for sub-$3.5 billion, to 'defend the entire Android ecosystem'. Noting Android's smartphone dominance ever since, offence may be the more accurate term than defence!? [By comparison, Apple, Microsoft, and RIM bought Nortel's patent portfolio for $4.5 billion, also in 2011]. And second, the gross consideration for Motorola is actually less than 50% of the annual $26 billion free cash flow Alphabet now generates!\n\nClearly, Alphabet's current acquisition/investment strategy is value-enhancing, but even snagging a few decacorns won't put a serious dent in its growing cash pile. A step-change in strategy is required - that is, listed and much larger target companies, with revenues, profits, and users being the primary driver. But I'm not convinced that will happen anytime soon - as surely it would require Alphabet to become just a little more evil? ['Evil' is confusing, now I just substitute 'corporate']. Returning cash to shareholders is the obvious alternative. And right now, I'd bet it's a far more likely outcome. And the transition to a holding company structure heralds a greater focus on capital allocation, with Ruth Porat adding an external perspective. [She's called Ruthless Ruth, reflecting the silly notion she's a bull in a china shop. But her hiring was clearly integral to the Alphabet road-map - doubtless, she has Larry and Sergey's full backing. And Larry never liked saying no - now he's got Ruth to do it!] While Alphabet hasn't signaled a dividend, it did complete its first $5 billion plus share buyback in 2015/2016, and recently approved a new $7 billion buyback programme.\n\nRepatriation would be the real catalyst here - to fund, perhaps, a much larger share tender offer - the company now has $52 billion of cash re-invested overseas. I think this was always inevitable, but now appears far more imminent and likely under Trump. [In fact, a 15% (or even higher) tax rate up-front would eliminate a repatriation bill - companies could just take the incremental tax hit. Either way, the tax bill is only a few months of free cash flow for Alphabet]. And speaking of catalysts, it's a brave new world out there for technology companies - activist investors now have an appetite for targeting and harrying even the largest of technology companies to declare a dividend, do a spin-off, buy back shares, or even take on debt.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet has $13 billion of cash and $73 billion of securities (primarily in treasuries, sovereign bonds, and agencies). Also: i) $6 billion of investments - any volatility or illiquidity is more than offset by $5 billion plus of unrecorded revaluation gains, ii) $1.4 billion of Lenovo promissory notes due in October - their balance sheet and cash flow suggest no reason to doubt this will be paid, and iii) a recently announced $0.8 billion for a non-controlling stake in Verily - the final tranche to be received in H2-2017. Anyone nit-picking these figures should remember Alphabet is now generating $2.2 billion free cash flow per month! So while we're at it, it's reasonable to also include an additional $5 billion plus of free cash flow year-to-date:\n\n$12.9 Billion Cash + $73.4 Billion Marketable Securities + $5.9 Billion Investments + $1.4 Billion Promissory Note + $0.8 Billion Temasek Deal + $5.3 Billion Free Cash Flow Year-to-Date = $99.7 Billion Total Cash and Investments = $145 Cash and Investments per Share\n\nThat's a round $100 billion - like I said, a ton of cash and investments!\n\nOther Bets - Moonshots and Unicorns:\n\nSequoia Capital, Benchmark, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, Index Ventures, Y Combinator - how many investors would give up their first-born just to invest in these unicorn firms? Yes, they're the some of the best and brightest VC firms in the world, and have the unicorns and IRRs to prove it. At best, you'll face a near-impossible set of hoops (and possibly several layers of fees), to invest in their funds - at worst, it's actually impossible.\n\nSo why not consider Alphabet instead?\n\nFrom day one, Google told its shareholders to expect 'smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses'. With the creation of Alphabet, it has now carved out most of these moonshots into a segment called Other Bets - which includes Nest, Google Fiber, Verily, Calico, X, Waymo, GV and Capital G. As any VC worth his IRR will tell you, finding unicorns is all about identifying the best teams (smart, passionate, and experienced founders, managers, and employees), the largest and fastest growing opportunities (the biggest markets and broadest demographics), and then (and only then) the best business model to generate revenue and ideally profits (monetizing needs, wants, and eyeballs). Given Alphabet's record of investment and value-creation to date, its ability to attract many of the smartest and most talented people in the world, its targeting of some of the largest markets on earth (or possibly even space), I'm willing to bet its Other Bets unit may potentially offer one of the best unicorn farms in the world!\n\nAnd what better confirmation of Page and Brin's faith in these moonshots - they chose to pursue them in-house, regardless of cost (that's now changing). And cost is critical here: Invest in a VC fund, and you will record an asset on your (personal) balance sheet, as would Alphabet making external investments in companies and VC funds. But investing in its own moonshots in-house, the rules dictated it record a pre-tax $3.6 billion P&L loss* last year - not a balance sheet asset! Yes, accounting is sometimes that arbitrary. [*Reflecting Other Bets early-stage revenues, which are fast-growing but still minimal (that is, less than 1% of Alphabet's total revenues), versus its current expense base]. Here's what it looks like over the last 5 years:\n\nYes, as I'm sure you know, these misleading losses are the culprit behind Alphabet's margin erosion and earnings shortfall (versus top-line growth) over the last 4 years. And while Porat appears to be imposing more budgetary and investment discipline now, I wouldn't necessarily expect much reduction in losses in the near-term - any scaling-back of expense and ambition in one area will likely be redirected into other more promising bets. But as of today, for an Alphabet investor, a cumulative $9.5 billion of Other Bet losses have been fully expensed, but still offers a potentially very valuable free option. And also, ongoing losses should be treated as investment - that is, an asset. Which I suspect presents limited financial risk: Actual cash losses, net of tax, should remain a fraction of overall free cash flow, while ongoing investment is justified if Other Bets can boast, sell, or spin-off a decacorn (say) in the next 3-5 years. [Notably, Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is a loss-making company which generated $0.4 billion revenue last year (precisely 50% of Other Bets 2016 revenue), but is actually worth $24 billion today!?]\n\nAnd so, Other Bets losses will be ignored here, with no Other Bets investment asset being created or included for valuation purposes either.\n\nThe Cash Machine:\n\nAnd last but definitely not least, we have the Cash Machine itself, as Googlers sometimes call Google. Having confirmed Alphabet's cash and investments, and re-classified its Other Bets losses as potentially highly valuable VC investments, we can finally evaluate its core business, that is Google's valuation on a stand-alone basis. But we still need to make some minor adjustments, plus one final essential accounting adjustment. First, here's Google's last 5 years:\n\n[NB: Unallocated corporate costs (approximately $0.6 billion per annum) are included here, so revenue and operating income in the Google and Other Bets tables fully reconciles back to the consolidated Alphabet table at the beginning of this post.]\n\n[NB: First table above details Google's advertising segments, then advertising and other segments. While the second table details Google's total revenues, etc.]\n\nWhat a thing of beauty! Advertising revenue growth from Google's core properties - Search, YouTube, etc. - has averaged 20% pa, despite significant headwinds (annual declines in costs-per-click) from the ongoing transition to mobile. The laggard is revenues from ads placed on external Google Network Members' properties (via AdSense, AdMob, and DoubleClick) - revenue growth has been throttled by the same costs-per-click decline. However, this has been essentially offset by the extraordinarily rapid (49% pa) growth in other revenues, from Google Play (note only net revenue is recorded), hardware sales, Google Cloud services, etc. Google revenues overall have grown 19% pa, which obscures a consistent 20% plus constant currency growth rate (in fact, averaging 22% pa). Again, a general increase in stock-based compensation has marginally reduced operating income growth to 18% pa, noting a stable 31% GAAP operating margin in the last couple of years.\n\nThe obvious issue here is whether to focus on GAAP or non-GAAP (that is, ex-SBC) operating income. Wall Street is perfectly comfortable with the latter, and usually I'm happy to ignore stock-based compensation too: On the basis it's a non-cash expense, it vests (or expires) over a number of years, it may be dependent on specific performance and share price targets. Not to mention, as I re-iterate my fair value analysis over time, I'd expect future dilution (unless stock-based compensation is really excessive) to be (more than) offset by future revenue and earnings growth. But in this instance, I'd note the following:\n\n[NB: I had to presume all intangible asset expenditure was acquisition-related, and therefore ignore it in the table above.]\n\nActual capex substantially exceeds current depreciation and amortization expense - so, despite no stock-based compensation cash cost, Alphabet's free cash flow is only marginally higher than GAAP net income (on average) over the last 5 years. [Obviously, absent this additional capex, free cash flow would be even more impressive!] While we might expect this gap to close over time, it's prudent to focus accordingly on Google's 31% GAAP operating margin (presuming it also corresponds to underlying cash flows). [Note Alphabet just confirmed it will no longer provide non-GAAP earnings (though Wall Street will probably still derive them]. But noting the current growth momentum, we can also anticipate a current revenue and earnings run-rate. While Wall Street is happy to reference 2017 (and even 2018) estimates at this point, I'd normally gross up the latest quarter to arrive at a reasonably conservative annual run-rate. However, Google revenues exhibit a seasonal pattern, rising each quarter to reach a Q4 peak at 29% of annual revenue (I see no operating margin seasonality). Therefore, noting 22% and 24% actual/constant currency growth rates in Q4, let's split the difference twice - that is, use a 23% average growth rate, then halve it - for a conservative 11.5% uplift in revenues. Using the same 31% operating margin, we apply Alphabet's 19% effective tax rate (3 year average), to arrive at:\n\nWhich puts Google on revenue of $99.7 billion, precisely equal to total cash and investments (a coincidence Page and Brin would presumably love?), and a net earnings run-rate of $24.6 billion - for an ex-cash 20.2 earnings multiple (remember, this is after stock-based compensation expense).\n\nUnfortunately, we essentially face the same accounting issue here. After centuries of accounting for purely tangible assets and value creation, the accounting profession still refuses to properly appreciate the fact intangible assets have been responsible over the last 50-100 years for an ever-expanding slice of the pie, in terms of economic and corporate value-creation. [Haven't come across a copy yet, but I suspect 'The End of Accounting' is the best read going on this entire topic]. So the vast majority of corporate research and development/intangible asset expenditure continues to be treated as expense, not an investment. Which has its pros and cons: Investors mostly adjust accordingly (that is, they reverse out some or even all of this intangible expense), which explains why intellectual property companies (as in technology, media, pharmaceuticals, etc.) often trade on steep earnings multiples versus the rest of the market. But occasionally, in certain sectors and/or companies, investors seem to lose sight of this earnings suppression - which can throw up some real bargains.\n\nI tend to split the difference by adding-back half a company's intangible expenditures (excluding acquisition-related investment), or possibly two thirds if it has a strong record of innovation and value-creation, to arrive at a more sensible underlying earnings number. Obviously, some R&D/intangibles will never have value, much will have value only for a year or two, but some may turn out to have enduring value for decades to come - my implied amortization, over 2-3 years, seems more appropriate (or maybe even conservative). Again, I enjoy the potential future benefit of all intangible expenditure expensed to date (though bearing in mind some future revenue and earnings decline may occur as historic intangible investment no longer supports or contributes any value).\n\nIn this instance, Laszlo Bock's 'Work Rules!' inspired me (far more than Schmidt's 'How Google Works'). Google's famous '20% time' may no longer exist, but as Bock says, that doesn't really matter 'as long as the idea of it exists'. I'll certainly run with that - employees may no longer literally carve out a day each week to mess around with stuff, but Google obviously remains committed to huge investment in its core business, continually ranking and allocating more (or less) resources to products and services which are often still pre-revenue, margin-free, or even plain old loss-making. [YouTube is a prime example - it is, by far, the largest streaming business globally (over 1 billion users per month), but appears to be only in the early innings now of generating revenue, let alone margins. As Google's CEO Sundar Pichai recently stated, 'we believe [it's] only begun to scratch the surface'].\n\nAnd so, if we treat 20% of operating expense (on average) as intangible investment, we're talking about $13.9 billion. [Disagree with this approach? Note Alphabet's current R&D run-rate is probably about $2 billion higher at $15.7 billion (an average 15.6% of revenue over the last 3 years)]. Then if we back out two thirds of this expense (net), we have:\n\nWe arrive at a far more accurate picture of Google's underlying earning power - a 40% adjusted operating margin, and adjusted net income of $32.1 billion, which puts Google trading on an adjusted/ex-cash 15.5 earnings multiple (again, this is after stock-based compensation expense). Which I think is an astonishingly cheap multiple for Alphabet's core business (which still represents over 99% of consolidated revenue), in light of its consistent 22% pa (constant currency) revenue growth in the last 5 years, and its obvious future revenue/earnings potential.\n\nFor a minute, compare Google's trajectory to that of Unilever. Now consider this fascinating Lindsell Train analysis (published prior to the Kraft Heinz bid): Investors appear to vastly underestimate the value of consistent compounding - one could have paid a 46 P/E for Unilever 20 years ago, and still have achieved market returns since!\n\nThe lesson, of course, is not to focus unduly on the current multiple, or even your fair value estimate - your primary focus should always be on the potential for consistent compounding. Which means getting comfortable with the depth and width of Alphabet's economic moat. Applying one of Buffett's favorite tests is a great place to start:\n\nIf I gave you $10s of billions, or maybe even $100 billion, could you take on and beat Google's leading global position in Search?\n\nGoogle's global share in desktop search is an astonishing 81% - the rest just exist because of China, purchased access/market share deals, and user inertia. Mobile search offers no such places to hide, hence Google's share is a truly astounding 96%. Also being globally dominant in desktop browsers (Chrome, 59%), and mobile operating systems (Android, 67%) have helped protect and grow Google's position. Do you really want to take on that kind of dominance? OK, well it's not just the money, where do you get the people - they probably already work for Google, and a larger compensation package in a brand new search company probably won't entice them. And even if you scrape together a team, what exactly are you going to build from the ground up? What data, queries, etc. are you going to use to help build, test, and improve your search engine? How exactly will you map and access the entire web to feed the beast? How do you plan to roll it out in over 100 different languages? And if somewhere years down the road you're finally ready to go live, how do you actually intend to attract even a small slice of all those captive Google search users?\n\nWait, I have one more question: What do you think Google was doing while you were holed up in your office for the last few years? Resting on its laurels? I think not. Oh, and did I mention:\n\n'Google' is also a verb.\n\nOK, why not give the money back, eh?\n\nAnd who better than Charlie Munger to remind us:\n\n'Google has a huge new moat. In fact I've probably never seen such a wide moat.'\n\nThat's the beauty of search - its format may change, but the need for search doesn't. In fact, it's fueled by population growth, expanding access to the internet, the continued migration online (and the decline of TV and newspapers), and in turn to mobile and smartphones, and most of all the iterative human addiction for more and more info, answers, and entertainment. Not to mention the network effect of search itself - more searches will produce better searches which produce more searches. [And the same is true of machine learning - the more data, the more input, the more variety, the better the learning - Google's current search remit gives it a huge edge on its potential rivals who are perhaps working with much more specialized data sets/universe.]\n\nGoogle has built an advertising colossus on the back of this search engine dominance and user growth. Together, Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) now control about two thirds of the digital advertising market, and are essentially sharing all new growth between them. Of course, this is nowhere near being a mature market, with old media still hanging on grimly to a totally disproportionate share of advertising (versus consumers' actual viewing and consumption habits today), mainly due to corporate and ad agency inertia. Which adds another huge tailwind of growth, compounded by the explosion in mobile advertising in just the last few years. There's also a land-grab element to all this: People wring the hands over declining costs-per-click, but that's only natural (and obviously more than offset by clicks paid growth) - increasing the digital advertising pie, and grabbing as large a slice of the pie as possible is what really matters now. And when that finishes, I guarantee you'll see a very different pricing scenario emerge for advertisers.\n\nThen longer term, there's a whole other land-grab ahead: Alphabet's US revenues still represent 47% of total revenues, about double the US share of world GDP - that would suggest huge long term upside growth potential in digital advertising revenues across the rest of the OECD, and particularly in emerging and frontier markets (which are now leap-frogging straight into the digital/smartphone age). Of course, another reason for this is Alphabet's virtual absence from China - a huge untapped opportunity that potentially awaits - if Google was any other company in the world, i.e. just a little bit more evil, they'd buy Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) first thing tomorrow morning & justify it (to China - I suspect all other stakeholders would love the deal, or simply not care) as a stand-alone non-integrated acquisition.\n\nOf course, the same story is now unfolding with YouTube. People marvel at the latest user numbers from Spotify and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), but they're totally dwarfed by YouTube's 1 billion plus users, to which it's only recently started to roll out channels, studio-based shows and original content, YouTube Red, Live TV, etc. If you want to target Millennials, or Gen Z, they aren't watching regular TV, and they certainly aren't reading newspapers - the killer app is now video. And, of course, video ads. On your smartphone. Again, I'll highlight this Barron's piece on YouTube - the numbers are really astonishing - but looking at some of the valuations already out there in the market, I can't necessarily disagree YouTube (plus Google Cloud, and possibly other units too) would likely get valued at significantly higher sales multiples than Alphabet currently commands.\n\nIn the past, this may have been academic, but now Alphabet has a holding company structure (and also a top Wall Street CFO) that's specifically designed to focus on capital allocation and to empower its units to actually innovate, thrive, and grow as independent entrepreneurial businesses, ideally on a stand-alone basis. And as they grow bigger, and/or head in different directions, Alphabet doesn't necessarily have to grow (or abandon) them any longer - at times, it may make far more sense, in terms of strategy or valuation, to sell or actually spin them off as listed entities (ideally, as unicorns and decacorns!).\n\nAnd looking ahead, while I still have my doubts whether Alphabet will embrace a step-change in its acquisition strategy (that is, target listed and much larger companies), I'm not sure it matters. We're now getting closer and closer to an always-on world - where computing genuinely does become a utility, like electricity. Almost all of the Google bets and Other Bets are stitching together the potential to provide cloud-based, always connected (via car, mobile, Wi-Fi, Internet of Things), artificial intelligence and machine learning (and even augmented and virtual reality).\n\nFor the world, that means universal simultaneous voice translation. For individuals, it means entertainment, education, and personalised assistants. And for corporates, it means predictive data analytics, and cyber-security. Linked to all of this, we have Alphabet's huge moonshot initiatives in autonomous driving, health and life sciences, and the wired home. [Education is the obvious missing moonshot - OK, now there's an acquisition opportunity!] And while I think Google's presided over the most valuable artificial intelligence the world's ever known (forget the actual advertising revenues and benefits, think of the incredible time savings and other benefits the human race derives from search itself every single day!?), I suspect its DeepMind acquisition could eventually prove hugely valuable too. [And the mind boggles if they can also bring quantum computing into the equation].\n\nOK, that's about enough future fun and frolics - now let's pull together a fair value estimate for Alphabet. I promise it'll be painless, all the building blocks are now in place. We already have $100 billion of cash and investments. And we're treating Other Bets losses as venture capital investment (and ignoring all related revenue, losses, and assets). Which only leaves Google - here, I'll average two separate approaches: A growth-based P/E valuation, and a more static and mature P/S valuation.\n\ni) Google has delivered 18% pa operating income growth over the last 5 years, despite significant FX headwinds. I'm pretty confident its economic moat is deep and wide, and its growth prospects over the next few years are as just as good, if not better. You can do the math, look at some of the market multiples, review that Unilever analysis again, but you know that a 30-40 P/E could just as easily be justified (or actually attained, in due course). Stick-in-the-mud I am, I'll limit myself here to a 20.0 P/E fair value multiple, based on the $32 billion adjusted net income I derived above (though I'll assure you, I don't consider that an actual exit multiple).\n\nii) Mature operating margins of 50-60% plus for Google's core business wouldn't surprise me in the least, but let's stick to the 40% adjusted operating margin I identified above. Which deserves a 5.0 P/S fair value multiple - again, I believe I'm being pretty conservative, in light of some of the market multiples out there for similar high margin (and many lower margin) companies. Obviously, a more mature Google could harness substantial debt capacity cheaply, with essentially zero impact on its market valuation - to fund buybacks, acquisitions, etc. - therefore, let's incorporate some of that capacity into our valuation. To better reflect actual cash flows, this time we'll reference Google's 31% GAAP operating margin: The company could add $91 billion of debt, and comfortably maintain 6.7 times interest coverage (assuming a 5% long-term interest rate) - as usual, I'll apply a conservative 50% haircut & deduct current outstanding debt of $3.9 billion, to arrive at a $42 billion debt capacity adjustment. And so, putting it all together:\n\n$99.7 Billion Cash and Investments + $0 Other Bets + ($99.7 Billion Run-Rate Revenue * 5.0 P/S + $41.7 Billion Debt Adjustment + $32.1 Billion Adjusted Net Income * 20.0 P/E) / 2 = $691 Billion / 688 Million Shares = $1,003.87 Fair Value per Share\n\nRounding, that's a $1,004 Fair Value per Share, and an Upside Potential of 16%.\n\nWhich might seem insane - we've come all this way for 16%?! But again, this fair value estimate is a much less important component of any analysis and investment - it's all about Alphabet's ability to continue growing revenue, and to compound earnings and value. Now, sure, I could map out a 'precise' growth trajectory for Alphabet over the next five years, and a future target share price, but that only offers up a hostage to fortune. And anyway, anybody who wants to buy the shares needs to ponder this trajectory for themselves. Suffice to say, in the next few years, I believe Alphabet will be a compelling investment opportunity under most scenarios. To reference Buffett, you can't buy a great business cheap, but my fair value estimate and upside are a reminder you can occasionally buy a great business at a fair price!\n\nInvestors can choose from the Class A shares (GOOGL:US) which have 1 vote per share, and trade at a 2.5% premium (close to the average 2.4% premium since 2014), or the Class C shares (GOOG:US) which have no vote. Some will simply opt for the C shares, and never worry about a premium - fortunately, further share buybacks will target C shares, but conversely they're also Alphabet's future currency for employee compensation and potential acquisitions. As for the A shares, some will argue their votes have no incremental value, since Page, Brin, and Schmidt still have majority control, via the super-voting power of their unlisted B shares. But if you think a dual-share structure is a bit evil, just a touch more evil could see significantly different values attached to each share class in some value-realization event. Then again, what are the chances of such an event? In all likelihood, the outcome for an A shareholder probably isn't any different than a C shareholder - at some point, they eventually sell their shares in the open market, at much the same premium.\n\nAs for the charts, they both tell the same message: See here and here. Alphabet shares appear to trace a pattern over the years, alternating between distinct consolidation and rally phases, often lasting 1-2 years at a time. And in terms of that timing, and the current share price, we may be on the verge of a critical departure right now - the shares are currently breaking out to new all-time daily and closing highs. If we do actually see a sustained break higher, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see a $1,000 plus share price melt-up from here, in short order.\n\nI now have an 8.5% portfolio holding in Alphabet Inc., and I specifically own the Class A shares (GOOGL:US).\n\nAlphabet Inc.

However, experts are increasingly warning about overvalued issues and market bubbles — a theme that likely won’t fade this week.\n\nA number of tech stocks have stolen the spotlight heading into Monday’s trade. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ: BBRY ) made waves over the weekend, while Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) was getting batted around after a Monday morning headline.\n\nHere’s what you need to know going into today’s trade:\n\nTesla Inc (TSLA)\n\nTSLA stock is down Monday after the company’s shares were knocked down a peg by the analyst community.\n\nGoldman Sachs downgraded Tesla shares on Monday morning, dragging the company down from “Neutral” to “Sell.”\n\nAnalyst David Tamberrino says:\n\n“While we believe Tesla currently has a lead relative to OEM peers with respect to vehicle technology adoption, electric vehicle architecture, and (potentially) battery scale, our concerns are more near-term oriented with respect to operational execution on the Model 3 launch, an unproven solar business, and cash needs. Ultimately we see a delayed launch (pushing volume growth out and to the right) and FCF burn rate (necessitating a capital raise before 4Q17) to weigh on TSLA’s shares.”\n\nTamberrino also worries that the SolarCity acquisition “increased the risk profile of Tesla amidst a business model transition,” and lowered the price target slightly from $190 to $185.\n\nTesla is coming off a fourth-quarter earnings report during which it was announced that CFO Jason Wheeler would be exiting in April — a surprising move that has drawn a little scrutiny from the investment community.\n\nTSLA shares are off more than 2% this morning.\n\nAlphabet Inc (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet announced that one of its artificial intelligence products will be available in more of the company’s products moving forward.\n\nGoogle Assistant will now be available in the company’s tablets, smartphones, computers and smartwatches for anyone using Android 6.0 Marshmallow or higher. It can even be used on smart TV systems such as Nvidia Shield TV and AI car systems.\n\nGoogle Assistant is Alphabet’s virtual assistant app that competes with the likes of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Siri and Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Alexa.

Sounds like a plan" ], "article_text" : [ "Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ) X wants to create a “Wing Marketplace” for drone deliveries.\n\nThe idea behind the Wing Marketplace is that it will allow customers to place orders and have them delivered in a short period of time. It would cost customers $6 for the drone deliveries. However, Alphabet Inc has been having trouble getting drones ready for deliveries.\n\nAlphabet Inc has had two successful tests delivering goods to non-employee customers. One took place in 2014 with a delivery to an Australian rancher. The other had it delivering burritos to Virginia Tech students and teachers. This test took place in September and deliveries were made from a Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG ) truck only a few hundred feet away.\n\nAlphabet Inc is reportedly in talks with restaurants and retailers about its Wing Marketplace. Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NASDAQ: WFM ) and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE: DPZ ) are among these restaurants. X was also in talks with Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) about the idea, but it wasn’t interested due to certain restrictions, reports The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAlphabet Inc isn’t the only company that wants to use drones for deliveries. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has been making its own progress with drone deliveries. It revealed earlier this this that it wants to deliver packages to customers within half an hour. However, a launch date and delivery prices have not been announced.\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS ) is also looking into drone deliveries. It started conducting its own tests with drone maker CyPhy Works in September. The delivery service has also been using drones inside of its own warehouses for different tasks.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace", "Last August, Google announced it would change its name to Alphabet, which would effectively be a holding company for Google and its various businesses — YouTube, Android, etc. — as well as Google's more outlandish experiments, like its moonshots factory, \"X\"; its investment arms; and more.\n\nThe reasons Google provided mainly had to do with clarity for investors. By creating two specific segments of Google, investors and shareholders could separate the strengths of Google — namely, search and ads — from its riskier endeavors, like self-driving cars. Another reason: Larry Page, then Google's CEO, wanted to take a backseat in operations in order to focus on his bigger dreams, like the company's moonshots in health and energy.\n\nThat's all well and good for Page, Sergey Brin, and the various executives at Google and Alphabet. But one year later, if you ask a random person on the street if they know what Alphabet is, they likely wouldn't know.\n\nThis Google Trends data, which compares the volume of Google searches for \"Google\" versus \"Alphabet,\" says it all:\n\nAnd that is probably the biggest benefit from the name change: Google's more controversial projects, such as its efforts to expand its reach with accident-prone drones and sensitive healthcare technology, no longer have Google's name on them. They're now owned by Alphabet, an innocent-sounding company you've probably never heard of.\n\nGoogle has wrestled with its public image for years\n\nFor over a decade, Google was the darling of the Internet Age, providing the best search experience, as well as the best online maps and email experiences. Its unofficial motto was \"Don't be evil,\" a reminder that while the company manages a ton of personal data, it must never use it for \"evil,\" which would tarnish the important bond of trust Google had with its customers.\n\n(\"Don't be evil,\" by the way, also created the notion that Google would never do anything perceived as evil, which is a challenging, if not impossible, expectation to live up to.)\n\nToward the end of the 2000s, Google's image started to change. A big moment was when Google introduced Android in 2008 — an operating system that looked and felt a lot like Apple's iPhone operating system, which was introduced one year before. People found it suspicious that Google developed Android while its CEO, then Eric Schmidt, sat on Apple's board of directors during the iPhone's development. Making matters worse, Apple's late founder, Steve Jobs, called Android \"outright theft\" and vowed to destroy Android, fueling feelings that Google wasn't living up to that \"Don't be evil\" mantra.\n\nOther instances in recent years where Google came across as creepy:\n\nIn 2010, Google's Street View cars were caught eavesdropping on people's Wi-Fi connections.\n\nIn 2011, Google agreed to forfeit $500 million after a criminal investigation by the Justice Department found that Google illegally allowed advertisements from online Canadian pharmacies to sell their products in the US.\n\nIn 2012, Google circumvented the no-cookies policy on Apple's Safari web browser and paid a $22.5 million fine to the Federal Trade Commission as a result.\n\nAlso in 2012, Google tried to create a single privacy policy for all of its services, which outraged some customers, as they believed this would make it easier to sell data to advertisers.\n\nWhile changing the name from Google to Alphabet and reorganizing Google's various properties under Alphabet doesn't change the past, it does help prevent similar public relations debacles from happening in the future. Since it's technically Google's parent company currently working on all of its projects that might be considered \"creepy\" — like drones, self-driving cars, genetic engineering, machine intelligence, or its project to extend the human life span — the name Google is kept out of people's mouths and out of the media, to some degree.\n\nAll of this is to say Alphabet and Google are not bad or evil companies just because of this PR shift. If anything, it's extremely smart of Page and company to separate Google's uncertain experiments from its solid-yet-mundane search and ads business. But the staggering difference in public awareness between Alphabet and Google is worth noting — so if you ever see a news headline about Alphabet, just think \"Google.\"", "Enlarge Image Google\n\nIn Google's version of the future, a drone could deliver your pizza.\n\nThe search giant's parent company, Alphabet, is considering the launch of a drone delivery endeavor, called Wing Marketplace, for shuttling food through the air to consumers, according to a report Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe company has met with Domino's Pizza and grocer Whole Foods as possible partners, the report said, citing former Google employees. Each delivery would cost customers a $6 fee.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSilicon Valley giant is keen on experimenting with small unmanned aircraft to tend to consumer needs. Amazon, for instance, is also testing drones for delivering packages, while Google and Facebook have tried out drones for beaming internet connectivity to remote regions.\n\nWing Marketplace is part of an initiative called Project Wing, by Alphabet's moonshot division, called X. The company began talking up its drone ambitions in 2014, initially deciding to focus on delivering resources in disaster relief efforts. Since then, Google has altered its vision. In September, Project Wing began testing drone deliveries of Chipotle burritos to college kids and staff around Virginia Tech.\n\nProject Wing has had its share of problems. Challenges lie in making sure the drones don't crash and in figuring out the logistics of how to actually make the delivery. For instance, does the drone land, or should the drone lower the item to the ground on a cable?\n\nThe drone delivery project seems to be getting support straight from the top. According to the Journal, Google co-founder Sergey Brin moved his desk into the Project Wing offices earlier this year to spur the initiative along." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1319047619047619, -0.03998443077390445, 0.075 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4815238095238095, 0.52015455304929, 0.4652777777777778 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-07T15:15:49.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2016-12-07T00:00:00.000+0000" }, null ] }

Better still, advertisement money on steroids because the current generation of tech giants have carefully shrouded their cash machine from us in the pursuit of moonshots.\n\nFor Alphabet (GOOGL), it is AdWords and YouTube. For Facebook (FB), it is the reach of the social network buoyed by Instagram, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp.\n\nWhile Alphabet and Facebook have gazed beyond the surface into far-reaching possibilities via YouTube and Instagram, it is hard to justify the same for other platforms like Snap (SNAP) and Twitter (TWTR).\n\nThe commonality for all four is video ads.\n\nHow do they stack? Firstly, a peep into the future.\n\nWhile TV is bound to keep its edge as the leading cost bucket for video advertisement, digital video ads have been projected to grow at a faster rate.\n\nThe growth in demand for video ads will be driven by the consumption of more instant/live content. As more internet users spend time on native and web apps, inventory for video ads will build up given the increasing accessibility to faster and cheaper internet, the growing internet population, and the increasing simplification of video content creation tools.\n\nSource: eMarketer\n\nIn a new report released by Google, users now watch an astonishing 1 billion hours of video on a daily basis. This means more video ad revenue largely driven by the core YouTube algorithm which targets ads with longer viewability as compared to other video success metrics like the click-through-rate.\n\nNo other platform has achieved such feat thus far. In the chart above, an eMarketer survey reveals the huge demand for video ad placement on YouTube as against other platforms. With Facebook coming second while Twitter came in at a distant 7th, Snap was unranked.\n\nAll 4 platforms are keen on ramping up demand for their video ad inventory this year. At the forefront is Google, which has an enviable partnership with its content creators who are motivated to continue to produce top notch content on the platform. Google also has the advantage of extending its ad inventory with its Lightbox ads which can be served on its display network.\n\nThe Google display network consists of over 2 million websites reaching over 90% of internet users including Google AdSense, DoubleClick Ad Exchange publisher and blogger. This magnifies the reach of Google’s video ad inventory for YouTube.\n\nFacebook continues to experiment with live videos. It currently serves video ads in the newsfeed of its users. It has been able to expand the reach of its video ads with Instagram. The recent mimicry of key Snap features continues to add to the engagement and stickiness of IG, making it a growth machine for future battles for market share. However, it isn’t garnering as much interest as expected.\n\nA recent report by CNBC highlights the drawback in the rapid adoption of video ads on FB. Advertisers cited a lack of trust on the contextual content next to the video ads as well as problems with measurability. This makes it hard to make a case for premium pricing of some of its inventory, something Google currently enjoys on YouTube with its masthead inventory going for more than $300,000 per day.\n\nHowever, Facebook’s leadership is resolved to stop at nothing to build its inventory and ramp up demand for video ads. As a part of this effort, it is paying publishers to create quality content on the platform.\n\nIn terms of ad quality, Facebook tends to favor short-form video ads which have better completion and engagement rate. YouTube is responding with short video ads called bumpers ads which are non-skippable and play for less than six seconds.\n\nThis will break the consumer’s traditional desire to skip native pre-roll ads.\n\nOn Twitter, Periscope continues to drive the creation of live videos. Though management is resolved to direct more focus to video ad inventories, it isn’t arguable that it has the reach and cost-effectiveness of other platforms given its capped DAU. However, engagement rate has been increasing. Currently, the platforms record 1 million hours of video per day, a meager number compared to competitors'.\n\nOn Snapchat, over 150 million daily active users spend up to 25-30 minutes on the platform. Assuming a third of that time is spent consuming video content, that gives us 90 million hours of video consumption. This is a far cry from YouTube’s 1 billion milestone.\n\nOn the other hand, Facebook had achieved the milestone of 100 million hours of video consumption since 2016, putting it ahead of Snap.\n\nSnap’s advantage currently lies in the premium pricing it enjoys on its ad inventory. While it is yet to match other platforms in reach and measurement, its high level of engagement means it can carve out a niche for itself amongst millennials.\n\nWith an estimated FY’2017 revenue of 1 billion, it still has a long way to go. With a projected market size of 11.72 billion, assuming video ads generate a third of Snap’s revenue, that gives a market share of 2.8% in FY’2017.\n\nConclusion\n\nNear term, Google will continue to dominate the market for video ads due to the wide reach of its advertisement networks. However, Facebook stands a chance to close the gap with a better measurement API and this can be further accelerated by getting 1 billion users on Instagram.\n\nTwitter’s growth will most likely continue to stagnate until a better revenue model is put in place. The success of live streaming videos will continue to be capped by the declining growth in DAUs which has been driven by the troll accounts that have infested the platform. Like Snap, it needs to carve out a niche for itself to win on pricing, having lost the battle for reach.\n\nThe growing trend for AR and VR means platforms like Snap and competitors like Facebook which are investing heavily in AR (augmented reality) and VR (Oculus) will have an edge when the global internet audience adopts surreal reality as the de facto means of consuming internet content.\n\nSource: Simply Wall St\n\nInvestors are safer with Alphabet as it currently trades at an attractive EV/EBITDA multiple compared to its peers.\n\nGOOGL EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nYouTube has been playing an increasingly bigger role as a driver of Alphabet's growth. With the growing mix shift from premium desktop ad inventories to mobile ads, the demand for video consumption will provide more margins expansion as investors are currently discounting the low-profit margins for mobile ads.\n\nThe stickiness of the platform driven by the smart bidding capabilities (AI-driven) of Google's ad engine will ensure advertisers remain on the platform as they derive a greater ROI from their ad campaigns. This will drive a higher retention rate, thereby reducing marginal downsides for Google's ad business which currently accounts for the bigger part of its profit margins.\n\nAs more advertisers in developing countries adopt PPC advertisement, we should expect more volume-driven growth till the ad auctions become competitive enough to trigger price-driven growth.\n\nElsewhere, Facebook offers more prospects for faster growth. We can’t say if Snap will be around for much long; however, it stands the chance of being acquired if growth stagnates given the attractiveness of its IPs.\n\nI believe Alphabet remains a long-term buy due to its competitive moat and IP trove which will continue to give it an edge in the digital ad industry.\n\nIf you like my article and would like to stay up-to-date on the next one, you can click the \"Follow\" button next to my profile.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

(GOOG) Position Boosted by Smith Salley & Associates", "\nAlphabet Inc (GOOGL) Position Decreased by Concourse Capital Management LLC" ], "article_text" : [ "I’m a firm believer in Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). In the markets, there is an elite group of companies that define their respective industries. For example, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) owns e-commerce, while Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) has forever changed social media. And for now, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is the king of smart devices. But in my humble opinion, GOOGL stock tops them all.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDon’t get me wrong as this is not a slight against any of the above companies. Just let me forward a very basic observation — all these other names essentially require the internet to function. If not directly, then certainly, access to the internet represents their core marketing message.\n\nBut what happens when you own the internet? That’s a theoretical question to everyone except GOOGL.\n\nAs I mentioned in a prior contribution, the dominance of the GOOGL search engine is unparalleled. The margin between Alphabet Inc and the next biggest competitor, Bing, is a whopping 300%. It just gets worse as you go down the rankings. By the time you hit fifth place, it’s just not even worth considering. In any other industry, such a statement would be the death knell for the competition.\n\nEssentially, GOOGL stock is an investment in life itself. Many people thought that the name change to Alphabet — a play on the financial term “alpha” and the gambling term “bet” — was cheeky and a bit ridiculous. But it also signified that Alphabet Inc could do whatever it wants because no one can stop it. GOOGL stock was essentially either an asset or a threat, depending on your perspective.\n\nVolatility Is a Risk to GOOGL Stock\n\nUnfortunately, where it matters most for investors, GOOGL stock hasn’t always shown its best stuff. True, it’s early into 2017, and so far, it’s up over 4% year-to-date. Keep that up every month and you’re guaranteed a stellar annual return. But Alphabet Inc has also been inconsistent, as InvestorPlace contributor Chris Tyler points out. For example, GOOGL was looking at closing January at over 6%. Instead, it only secured 1.4%.\n\nOn a strictly nominal basis, that’s not much of a swing. But on percentage basis, it’s a much different story. It has been well over a decade since Alphabet stock introduced itself to the markets. The crazy dynamics involved in a fresh tech company should be over by now. Today, GOOGL and its subsidiaries are comparable to General Electric Company (NYSE: GE ) if GE was a little more hip.\n\nBut with great size comes great envy. Alphabet Inc now faces a fundamental problem. Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL ) wants to reengage a court ruling that went in favor of GOOGL. At issue is the company’s generous use of Oracle’s Java software in order to design the Android operating system. GOOGL contends that using Java — which is open-source — is fair game. Oracle contends that it violates the “fair use ” component of copyright law.\n\nFor those that acquired GOOGL stock, it’s an ugly situation that might be a legitimate risk. Here’s the thing — whether it’s legitimate or not doesn’t matter. If the markets think it’s a problem, it’s a problem. That makes the sighting of what appears to be a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern (between early December until now) a curious development.\n\nNext Page", "Smith Salley & Associates increased its position in Alphabet Inc.

The publication called the tech giant \"one of the world's great businesses,\" and \"an impressive growth company\" in spite of its size. The upbeat piece has GOOGL shares trading 1.8% higher at $778 -- though they're still slightly in the red on a year-to-date basis.Not everyone's a fan of the stock, however. Options traders have recently been buying to open GOOGL puts over calls at an accelerated rate. Specifically, the stock's 10-day put/call volume ratio at the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) is 0.88 -- just 7 percentage points from a 12-month peak.Echoing this put-skew is Alphabet's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR). At 1.00, this ratio indicates put and call open interest are even among options expiring in the front three-months' series. However, the SOIR ranks in the high 83rd annual percentile, hinting at a relative preference for puts over calls.No matter which options traders are interested in, right now is a good time to purchase premium on short-term contracts. GOOGL sports a Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 21%, sitting south of 99% of all other readings taken in the prior year. In other words, the options market is pricing in historically low volatility expectations at the moment.Returning to the charts, GOOGL has had a good day but an unimpressive year. Things have been tough since the stock's late-October peak, too, with the shares shedding 7.3%. Fortunately, it appears GOOGL stock may have established a foothold at its ascending 320-day moving average, which previously served as support in late June.Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) near-term struggles have been shared by its fellow \"FANG\" peers, including Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB). In fact, earlier today, the European Union called out both GOOGL and FB for not curbing hate speech quickly enough.\n\nSign up now for Schaeffer's Market Recap to get all the day's big stock movers, must-know technical levels, and top economic stories straight to your inbox.", "Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and tech stocks as a group bounced in Monday’s trading session. And while one day does not make a trend, this is at least worthy of our attention. Considering that the prospects of a further year-end rally in stocks remains very much on the table, GOOGL stock and other tech equities could once again be atop the list of stocks to chase higher.\n\nBefore going any further and digging into the charts, there are two important points to understand for the month of December, as far as the stock market is concerned:\n\nWhile seasonal patterns often work as a good guide to the general direction of the stock market in various parts of the year, the year-end or “Santa Claus” rally in my opinion is one of the most reliable seasonal patterns.\n\nTo respect the possibility of this year-end lift in stocks, it is important to understand the dynamics behind it.\n\nSimilar to other month- and quarter-end periods throughout the year, December is a time when fund managers window-dress their portfolios. This is the practice of buying strong-performing stocks during the period and selling down losing ones to show investors that the fund was invested in the right stocks.\n\nIn December, this practice is magnified because under-performing fund managers also must try one last attempt to meet or beat the benchmarks against which their performance is measured, which in turn forces them to chase those stocks higher that had the best performance or show the most promise.\n\nThanks to this phenomenon, tech investments such as GOOGL stock could once again be on the buy radar heading into year’s end.\n\nGOOGL Stock Charts\n\nWhen I last discussed GOOGL on Nov. 17, I offered that the stock market seems to be rotating back into the tech sector. Since then, Alphabet shares have indeed bounced, but the year-end lift hasn’t really taken off.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nOn the multiyear chart we see that the uptrending channel within which GOOGL stock has been trading for the past few years remains intact. The stock currently trades in the upper half of this channel, which is supported by the yellow 50-week simple moving average.\n\nNext Page", "Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has moved forward in its goal of using 100% renewable energy for all its operations. Instead of reaching that goal by 2025, the internet giant plans to achieve that by next year. This will include the energy used at all its offices across the globe as well as its data centers. Most of that renewable energy will be a mix of solar and wind.\n\n“To reach this goal we’ll be directly buying enough wind and solar electricity annually to account for every unit of electricity our operations consume, globally,” Google’s senior vice president for technical infrastructure, Urs Hölzle, wrote in an online posting.\n\nRenewable energy investment to continue\n\nAfter reaching its goal of using 100% renewable energy by next year, Google will still continue to invest in more renewable energy projects. This was stated in the internet giant’s inaugural comprehensive environmental report. This comes as the company continues expanding its cloud services which will mean that energy consumption will keep growing in tandem.\n\nBesides the renewable sources of energy being good hopefully for the environment, Google is also counting on generating cost savings. Wind energy costs have, for instance, fallen by more than 60%. At Google’s data centers, energy costs constitute a big component of operating expenses.\n\nLargest renewable energy buyer\n\nCurrently, Google is one of the biggest corporate buyers of renewable energy. Its move to renewable energy took on significant proportions in 2010 when it began with one deal. Then it purchased all the power generated by an Iowa wind farm, about 114MW. Such deals have now grown to reach 19. In a region like Asia where renewable energy is gathering steam, Google’s strategy will be to get into regional energy deals.\n\nThe achievement by Google in reaching its renewable energy goals is however restricted to Google only as other companies operating under Alphabet have different energy consumption levels. Plans are, however, underway to initiate sustainability efforts in the other Alphabet companies.\n\nIn Tuesday’s trading, Alphabet Inc closed the day lower at $776.18 having fallen by 0.26% from previous day’s trading.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1034303350970018, 0.09613041613041612, 0.07690972222222221 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4275661375661375, 0.4038309738309738, 0.4282986111111111 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-05T00:00:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2016-12-06T11:47:07.000+0000" }, null ] }

Sure, it generated $17.1 billion in operating income through the first nine months of its current fiscal year on $64.2 billion in revenue, but at the end of the day GOOGL stock only managed a total return for shareholders of 1.9%.\n\nThat’s on par with its internet content peers, but way off the 12% delivered by the S&P 500. Not good by Google standards.\n\nHolding GOOGL stock back — a bit of a misnomer considering that it has nearly doubled the return of the S&P 500 over the past five years — is a valuation that InvestorPlace contributor Dana Blankenhorn feels is “priced to near-perfection” with a price-earnings ratio of 29 based on a consensus per-share earnings estimate of $26.90 in 2016, $32.25 in 2017 and $36.99 in 2018.\n\nSo, analysts expect Alphabet to grow earnings by 17.3% annually over the next two years — that’s a two-year PEG ratio of 1.7. By comparison, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) has a two-year PEG ratio of 1.6 based on annual EPS growth of 29%.\n\nFrom this perspective, GOOGL stock doesn’t look too bad; you have to conclude that either FB is overvalued at this point or GOOGL isn’t quite as expensive as people think.\n\nEspecially when you consider that there’s still gas in Alphabet’s tank.\n\nGoogle Travel Is Fueling GOOGL\n\nLeading the charge is its travel business which has quietly become a key element in Alphabet’s success. As the travel vertical prospers, so too does Google and its parent.\n\nAccording to Dennis Schaal of Skift, Google’s travel business will generate an estimated $12.2 billion in advertising revenue in 2016, accounting for 13.7% of Alphabet’s projected 2016 revenue of $89.3 billion. Put another way, Google’s travel business will generate approximately 1,670% [calculation: $12.2/4 multiplied by 3 divided by Other Bets Q1-Q32016 revenue of $547 million] more revenue in 2016 than its Other Bets segment, which includes much of the innovative work being done by the company, including Nest, Fiber, etc.\n\nOn its own, Google Travel would be a pretty large company with operating profits of $3.8 billion. While advertising might be boring, one can’t underestimate the importance of this vertical to the company’s profitable growth.\n\nAnd you can forget about Google becoming an online travel agency with this much money on the line. It’s not going to cut off its nose to spite the face. It’s just not.\n\n“Google’s existing revenue from travel advertisers is already considerably larger than that of the Priceline Group Inc (NASDAQ: PCLN ); is roughly twice the size of Expedia Inc’s (NASDAQ: EXPE ), and Google generates more travel advertising revenue than that of Expedia, Ctrip (NASDAQ: CTRP ) and TripAdvisor Inc (NASDAQ: TRIP ) combined,” wrote Schaal in his November 2016 article on the subject. “Google undoubtedly takes that travel-advertising revenue and achieves a much higher profit margin on it than do the roster of its online travel, airline, hotel, car rental and cruise partners.”\n\nNext Page", "The digital-media industry has recently become a giant duopoly in which Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) are the key leaders. Ad industry veteran Jay Sears, Pivotal’s Wieser says that a majority of advertisers have to play by the rules of the two companies. Records indicate that their revenues were sharply up in 2016 with the third quarter of the year being the biggest ever. A total of $17.6 billion was spent on digital ads, which was a 20% increase from the same period a year earlier.\n\nHowever, this is very unfortunate for the startups because they may not get a grip on the market. In a research note to investors, Wiser wrote, “Smaller companies will continue to operate in the shadows of the industry’s two dominant players.”\n\nThe duopoly control has had an increasing impact on the advertising-tech market\n\nVenture Capital can easily conform to Google’s and Facebook’s market dominance. The company has been experiencing a downward trend of its activities since early 2015. Adtech, an umbrella term for companies that automate digital advertising has been having prominence in the last five years but it is now on a declining trend. These and others cannot monetize according to Balderton Capital venture partner Suranga Chandratillake who concurs that advertising is about selling attention. But sadly, a big chunk of the attention has been shifted to Google and Facebook and scaling up to compete with them is altogether another tall order.\n\nThe ad tech industry shrank 3% in the first half of 2016, which was at the expense of the two Californian giants. 85 cents of every new dollar spent on digital in the US last year went to the two companies. They have continued to build walled gardens that will help them tap their treasure troves\n\nSpending on digital ads in the U.S. will likely grow this year\n\nThere has been an era of real dramatic investment in the digital world. The ad: tech market is quickly embracing the search, social, and mobile platforms as investors and entrepreneurs concede to the Google’s and Facebook’s win. Meanwhile, Alphabets’ stock closed at $807.77 a decline of $0.24 or 0.03% while that of Facebook traded at $118.69 witnessing an increase of $1.83 or 1.57%.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "The improvement of advertising tools the likes of the creation of better algorithms by Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) And Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has been the source of their improved adtech offerings. This has put Venture capital, which have been advertising technology startups at a tight corner. In 2017, global Venture capitalists funded a total of 343 adtech deals. Given that this was a 17% drop from a year ago, which made $3.2 billion in 2015, only $2.2 billion was made as investment from the said deals.\n\nWhile Adtech startups can only be referred to as middlemen, their role is to solve pain points created by a lack of tools. However, both Google and Facebook seem to have been on top of the game in squeezing the growth of independent adtech startups. They have to some extent taken dominance of the advertising market. A report by published in June by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers indicated that the two have an estimation of 75% of all new online ad spending.\n\nBut the duo has vast war chests to create or acquire adtech tools\n\nBeing able to acquire the right adtech tools is not a big neither for Google nor for Facebook. The two are able to invest as much as the market dictates in order to capture big algorithmic advancements. This is the biggest challenge according to U.S.-based venture capitalists that were able to invest just $860 million in advertising technology deals. On the other hand, the two internet giants have their strategies in place. For example, Google has the search engine while Facebook has the social network.\n\nSundar Pichai Google’s chief executive officer proclaims “Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.“ His counterpart, Facebook’s CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg says that his company has a stronghold that gives everyone the power of sharing out. However, advertisers have the option of choosing which strategy they want to explore.\n\nGoogle and Facebook have the latest artificial machines\n\nInnovation is the foundation of every success. That said, the two companies have invested in some of the smarter machines in the market in an effort to increase their revenues. However, they still have their competitive platforms that give their particular uniqueness. For example, Google is far ahead of a Facebook in video thanks to the explosive growth of YouTube. Clearly, there is intense speed in internet development, which is an advantage to the two companies. Meanwhile, Facebook’s stock closed at $116.82 an increase of %1.77 or 1.54% while that of Alphabet closed at $808.01 an increase of $15.56 or 1.96%." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.05136054421768707, 0.02105142332415061, 0.1216720779220779 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.5338321995464852, 0.3685720844811753, 0.4581033549783549 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-01-06T16:54:54.000+0000" }, null, null ] }

But unless you are a mega-wealthy investor or manage a financial institution, you’ll likely not get any shares in the offering. Rather, you’ll have to buy SNAP in the after-market, when the valuation will probably be much higher.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSo is it any wonder that IPOs can be a raw deal?\n\nThat may be true, but when it comes to investing in the big-growth opportunities, there really is no need to speculate in the IPO market. Hey, there are a variety of interesting stocks currently on the market that should be good enough.\n\nTake a Look at GOOGL Stock\n\nOne to consider is actually Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ). Granted, the company is fairly mature, having been founded in 1998.\n\nBut what’s important about GOOGL stock is that the company has global brand, scale, infrastructure and massive user base to play in critical growth markets. Such factors are must-haves for getting the attention of sponsors, especially those that have massive budgets.\n\nThis is why a company like Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) has struggled so much. In fact, in the latest quarter, the company’s revenues increased by a mere 0.9% on a year-over-year basis to $717.2 million, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of top-line deceleration. U.S. revenues fell by 4% to $440 million and of course, the company has yet to generate a profit on a GAAP basis.\n\nAll this happened even though there were major catalysts from the presidential election, NFL streaming and the holiday season.\n\nBy comparison, in the latest quarter Alphabet reported an impressive 22% jump in revenues to $26.1 billion and GAAP earnings of $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per share on GOOGL stock.\n\nBut this shouldn’t be much of a surprise. The fact is that GOOGL is positioned nicely for major growth categories like video (YouTube), mobile (Android, Google Play and Waze), devices (Pixel and Google Home) and cloud computing. All these represent multi-billion-dollar market opportunities — and should all provide nice long-term drivers for GOOGL stock.\n\nJust look at Waze, which Alphabet Inc purchased for $1.3 billion back in October 2013. Interestingly enough, this price tag may have been a bargain! Note that GOOGL plans to launch a ride-hailing service — similar to Uber’s — in various cities in the U.S. that is based on the Waze platform.\n\nBy the way, back in 2013, the company also invested $258 million in Uber.\n\nNext Page", "Introduction\n\nI keep looking constantly for additional stocks that will fit my investment strategy, which is a form of dividend growth investing. I am not a conservative dividend growth investor. While it is by far my main strategy, I also combine some other strategies: Deep value, as I invest in companies like B Communications (NASDAQ:BCOM), sell options for additional income, and invest in stocks that do not pay dividends.\n\nThe reason I don't exercise the classic approach is that I have a very long investment horizon which allows me to take some more risks, as I don't need the income right here and right now. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is an example for a stock that I own, which doesn't pay dividend.\n\nAs I shared in the past, I keep looking for stocks in the information technology sector. While some companies seem overvalued, there are companies that are valued attractively, have strong fundamentals, and fantastic growth opportunities. Their only drawback is that they don't pay dividends.\n\nAlphabet is such a company, and in this article I will offer my thesis that Alphabet doesn't pay dividends YET. When you ignore the dividend, Alphabet passes every test in my flow chart. The flow chart below show the basic analysis method that I use when I consider investments.\n\nI make sure that my side strategies fit my dividend growth strategy. I sell puts for stocks I would like to buy at prices that I find attractive. I invest in BCOM because of its ability to produce massive yield on cost for me, and I invest in Alphabet because I believe that it has the potential to be a dividend champion in the future, and the process has already started.\n\nFundamentals\n\nThe chart below shows how mighty and powerful Alphabet is. The revenues grew very quickly, as Alphabet expanded its services worldwide, and kept offering new and innovative products and services to the customers. However, according to analysts covering the stock and the whole sector, the growth will slow down a little bit in the medium term.\n\nThe bottom line, both when looking at the EPS and the FCF grows in tremendous pace. The FCF grows twice as fast as the revenues, and it shows that the management knows how to monetize the services it offers. The FCF is what will pay for the dividends if initiated. As the FCF growth is expected to slow, Alphabet will still generate a growing surplus of cash.\n\nGOOG Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nAlphabet also has an extremely strong balance sheet. The balance sheet keeps improving. The company has over $80 billion in cash and short-term equivalents. While the company started to return money to shareholders via buybacks, the amount of cash keeps growing quickly. Moreover, the company has managed to lower the long-term debt it has.\n\nGOOG Cash and Short Term Investments (Annual) data by YCharts\n\nAs I mentioned above, Alphabet already shifted its course and started returning cash to shareholders. So far it is only buybacks, and no dividends, but as it becomes consistent, I am becoming more confident that we will see a dividend in the medium term. As I will present later in the article, buybacks are often the first sign for the coming dividend, especially among information technology companies.\n\nValuation\n\nThe first metric I use is the traditional price to earnings ratio. As always I am looking for companies with P/E lower than 20. The current P/E is almost 30, which might seem unattractive. However, I must take into account the EPS and FCF growth rate that Alphabet has showed and is forecasted to show in the near future. With such a quick growth, I believe that the current P/E is justified.\n\nTo take a closer look at the anticipated earnings growth, I will look at the forward P/E ratio. Here we see a whole different picture. The forward P/E is exactly 20. It means that if the company manages to live up to the expectations, the valuation is not high at all. I wouldn't call it cheap, but it is pretty attractive for a company that shows amazing growth over the past decade, and will continue to do so according to the consensus of analysts.\n\nGOOG PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nWhen I use the P/FCF ratio using FastGraphs, I see that the company trades at attractive valuation. The P/FCF is lower than the P/E ratio, and FCF is forecasted to grow quickly until 2019 according to analysts covering the company. Alphabet is a cash cow that generates massive amounts of excess cash.\n\nOverall, I find Alphabet to be valued attractively. Its P/E ratio is close to 30, but with its growth both in EPS and FCF, it is well justified.\n\nThe path for dividends\n\nSo Alphabet is a wonderful company, but it is for sure not a dividend growth darling. In this section I will explain why I believe Alphabet is already on its path for its first dividend payment. The first step towards dividends is the management's understanding that shareholders must be rewarded by more than capital gains.\n\nWe are already in the first step, as Alphabet declared in October 2016 that it will buy back stocks worth $7 billion. This is the second year in a row that the company announces a buyback plan, and this one is 40% larger than the previous buyback plan. In 2016 Alphabet returned 25% of its net income back to its shareholders.\n\nThe second step is the ability of the company to sustain long term cash payments of dividends. As I showed above, the balance sheet can easily support dividends together with the current buyback plan. It can be achieved while the cash and short-term investments will grow as well. Alphabet has no problem from a financial point of view to allocate some of its earnings towards dividends.\n\nThe question now is whether the management has any incentives to do so. As long as the top and bottom line are growing rapidly, avoiding the dividend can be done easily. The management will reward its shareholders with tremendous capital gains, so I believe there won't be many investors complaining.\n\nHowever, in several years when the growth slows down, the management will have to reward shareholders in a different method, and dividends are the most common way. I cannot be sure whether earnings growth will weaken in three or five years, or maybe even ten years, but with its market cap touching $600 billion, it will get extremely difficult to achieve the tremendous earnings growth we got used to.\n\nEven if we assume that Alphabet can keep growing at roughly 17% annually for the next five years, its EPS will be roughly $75. With a conservative P/E of 20 it will reach a market cap of over $1 trillion. It is almost impossible to grasp that a trillion dollar company can keep growing at such an amazing pace. Therefore, I believe that growth rate will slow down and management will be willing to reward its shareholders in the form of dividends.\n\nLet's assume that Alphabet declares a $4 dividend which is less than 10% of its earnings forecasted for 2017. I will also assume that Alphabet will grow its earnings in the next five years at 17%, 15%, 13%, 12% and 12%, respectively. This is a very conservative assumption. I will add a 10% annual dividend growth. In five years EPS will be around $65 and the dividend payment closer to $6. In this scenario, Alphabet will be still paying less than 10% of its earnings in the form of dividends, but these payments will reward shareholders that see earnings growth declines.\n\nThe yield on cost in this scenario will still be very low at 0.7%, but it will fit my strategy as I only need the income in several decades. Even if my thesis is wrong, and Alphabet is a company that keeps growing at almost 20% per annum, I will be a happy shareholder even without the dividends.\n\nPrecedents\n\nI look at two main precedents for my thesis: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Look at Apple, for example. The dividend payments started only after the amazing growth slowed down, and its growth rate became much slower. The buyback started right after the dividend payments started, and this is another case where EPS growth slowing down opens the door for returning capital to shareholders. It also shows that dividends and buybacks usually come together.\n\nAAPL Stock Buybacks (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nMicrosoft is another example for a company that has avoided paying dividends and/or buying its own stock as long as there was rapid EPS growth. However, as soon as the growth curve flattened, it started buying back its stocks and later paid dividends, including a large special dividend. Hopefully, Alphabet will follow Microsoft with dividends joining the current buyback plan.\n\nMSFT Stock Buybacks (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nWhy not others in the big five?\n\nThe other two companies in the big five of the information technology sector don't pay dividends as well. However, I wouldn't consider them for my dividend growth portfolio just yet. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shows amazing top line growth, but it still cannot turn it into EPS growth. While some investors have firm belief that the company will be able to turn revenues into income, I still prefer to watch it from the sidelines.\n\nFacebook (NASDAQ:FB) is another example for a company that I wouldn't try this strategy with. The company doesn't have a long history as a public company, and I would still like to see whether it can keep growing its earnings in the long term. Moreover, I never saw how Facebook dealt as a private company with a broad weakness in the market. The only time when Facebook had to cope with declining share price was after the IPO, and I remember pretty hysterical comments, so I prefer to avoid it at the moment.\n\nConclusions\n\nHaving a strategy means you follow it zealously. However, it doesn't mean you ignore different strategies that can help you fulfilling your goals. My strategy as a dividend growth investor is clear, but I can still use side strategies to enhance it.\n\nI find them complementary to my dividend growth strategy. Selling puts, buying Alphabet and investing in BCOM will support my long term goal of achieving income from my financial assets.\n\nThis strategy is relevant for young dividend growth investors. Alphabet is a wonderful company. As market cap is getting closer to $600 billion, growth cannot be infinite and will eventually slow down. If it does, dividend payments will make sense; if it doesn't, you will be able to sell it with massive capital gains. For young dividend growth investors, it is a great risk/reward ratio.\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are long BCOM, AAPL, GOOG.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

In fact, the shares this week lost hold of the round $800 mark, and they may struggle to get it back. Peak open interest currently resides at the January 2017 800-strike call, suggesting the level could emerge as resistance as front-month expiration approaches.\n\n\n\nToday the shares are off 1% at $795.17, and more losses could be ahead. GOOGL has ended only three of the last 10 first-quarter periods in positive territory, with an average return of negative 2% for the quarter over the past decade.\n\nEven after the equity's recent slump, however, optimism toward the Google parent runs high. Out of 29 analysts following the stock, all but two recommend buying the shares, and just one recommends selling. Plus, the average 12-month price target is seated deep in never-before-seen territory, at $967. Short interest on GOOGL is also low. After rising nearly 10% in the most recent reporting period, these bearish bets still account for a meager 0.5% of the security's total float.\n\nIf there is pessimism toward the blue-chip stock, it resides in the options pits. The stock's 10-day put/call volume ratio across the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) is seated just 2 percentage points from an annual high, at 0.89. Perhaps these recent put buyers are on to something, since it's an unusually attractive time to pick up Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) short-term options.\n\nMSFT still has a lead over the broad market, up 12% 2016, after hitting a record high above $64 last week. But the stock has been positive in the first quarter just three times in the last decade, with an average return of negative 1.7% for the period. The shares are down 1% today, at $62.24.\n\nAnalysts are mostly bullish toward MSFT, with 20 out of 26 calling the stock a \"buy\" or better. Short interest is also low, representing just 0.7% of the equity's available float. Even options traders have maintained upbeat positions toward the Dow component -- MSFT's 50-day call/put volume ratio at the ISE, CBOE, and PHLX is seated in the high 86th percentile of its annual range, at 2.37.\n\n\n\nAnd like GOOGL, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is presenting a compelling opportunity for options buyers. Based on the stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 16% -- lower than 89% of all readings from the last 12 months -- MSFT's near-term options should be particularly well-priced, from a volatility perspective.\n\nLet us help you profit from market volatility.

It seems they’re trying to do damage control after widespread headlines that the company had missed estimates for the bottom line. A change in the company’s accounting procedures apparently is causing some confusion.\n\nAlphabet stock to $1,000: Morgan Stanley\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak raised his target for Alphabet stock to a nice round $1,000 per share. The Google parent company reported adjusted earnings of $9.36 per share, compared to the consensus of $9.64 per share. However, after making further adjustments, Nowak says that the company would have reported $10.05 per share, excluding equipment charges, a one-time tax headwind, and other one-time charges.\n\nHe notes that the amounts of some of these one-time charges are unclear and that it’s not uncommon for Alphabet to income such charges below the line. However, he said based on fundamentals, the result was still better than expected.\n\nAnother key bullish point was that Websites revenue increased 23%, which was more than expected, and adjusted EBIT beat Nowak’s estimate by 9%, excluding some of the other charges he added in. He also spoke to the suggestion that the company’s core margin pressure was worsening, but he doesn’t think this is necessarily the case, even with the introduction of the Pixel phones. Again, this goes back to the one-time charges he includes that Alphabet didn’t.\n\nDeutsche Bank analysts peg Alphabet’s adjusted earnings higher than Nowak, at $10.30 per share after making their own adjustments and factoring in the 4.2% higher tax rate.\n\nAlphabet stock target to $1,050: Stifel\n\nDeutsche Bank analysts peg Alphabet’s adjusted earnings higher than Nowak, at $10.30 per share after making their own adjustments and factoring in the 4.2% higher tax rate.\n\nStifel analyst Scott Devitt boosted his price target for Alphabet stock from $950 to $1,050 per share after last night’s print. He continued the Wall Street narrative that the company actually beat consensus for non-GAAP earnings based on one-time adjustments. He merely described it as “comfortably above the Street if Alphabet has excluded the previously mentioned $320mm in one-time costs.”\n\nAmong the other analysts who boosted their price targets for Alphabet stock is Macquarie’s Ben Schachter, who moved his target from $975 to $995 and pronounced the fourth quarter report “mostly fine, more of the same.” Also Baird analyst Colin Sebastian raised his target for Alphabet stock from $930 to $960. He’s also of the view that the company’s non-GAAP earnings were better than what the headlines suggest and noted “surprisingly strong” revenues from the “Other” segment, which points to momentum in the Cloud, contributions from Play, and early success from the Pixel line, Home hardware products and other inclusions.\n\nAlphabet’s earnings a negative sign for Facebook?\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch analysts also agree with the view that Alphabet’s adjusted earnings should be considered a beat despite the headlines. They note that the company didn’t state what the $320 charge was for and that it said it will no longer exclude stock-based compensation from its non-GAAP earnings, which is a key change.\n\nOn a side note, they’re concerned that Alphabet’s earnings could be a bearish signal for Facebook which suggests that expectations could be too high. The reason is because Google Websites revenue didn’t match their “more bullish channel checks.”\n\nShares of Alphabet stock bounced around during regular trading hours on Friday, plunging before bouncing around midday to trade at around $851." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1011749482401656 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4399124064341455 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-01-27T12:13:35.000+0000" } ] }

That would give us a lot more confidence going forward; otherwise, our stops would kick in on the first few red days.\n\nLess than 30 days ago, I shared a trade that was designed to be a sure thing. Almost $4 per contract in profits came fast. Today, with those profits in my pocket, I want to “range trade” Alphabet stock instead. We could all use a little speculative risk in our portfolio.\n\nThe short story of Alphabet is that fundamentally it’s as solid as it gets. It’s the king of search, and that’s a cash cow that just keeps getting fatter. So with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 30, GOOGL’s potential is built in somewhat … but I think it’s not fully built in.

We have an 80% chance that price will stay above my strike where we need it.\n\nThe bearish side: Sell the GOOGL 13 Apr $887.5/$890 credit call spread for an additional 60 cents per contract. Here, given the upside potential in markets, our chances of success are around 75%.\n\nTaking both trades would constitute a sold iron condor for a total $1 in credit. Since we can only lose on one side or the other, our max risk drops, thereby raising my potential yield above 60% on risk. This trade’s delta is much higher than my usual points of entry, and that’s what makes it a speculative setup in GOOGL stock.\n\nIn this market, I know we’ll need to tightly manage this iron condor.

The company has spent large amounts of money acquiring companies and investing in new upstarts. Google’s Project Wing, for example, recently announced plans that could soon boost the price of GOOGL stock.\n\nAlphabet announced plans to create an online exchange named “Wing Marketplace” that would allow customers to get deliveries from selected retailers and restaurants.\n\nDrone deliveries aren’t new, but they have not been officially approved in all 50 states. Alphabet is but one of several companies that has tested drone deliveries and showcased its successful launches, but it’s also highlighted possible concerns.\n\nAn announcement like this isn’t usually that exciting. However, Alphabet named two companies that are actively looking at using this service, which would give the GOOGL Wing project a huge tailwind. Both Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NASDAQ: WFM ) and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE: DPZ ) are considering using this service in some capacity.\n\nWhile they have already declined to sign on due to concerns over the user experience, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) also considered the Wing Marketplace as an optional coffee delivery system.\n\nDelivering groceries by drone might need some work (how much weight can a drone carry and how much power will that require?). Delivering items like pizza or fast food, however, are more realistic achievements. For Dominos this represents another technological advancement.\n\nThis is a company that caught on to online ordering, mobile ordering and other technology quicker than other pizza companies. Domino’s even played a hand in the world’s first commercial pizza delivery by drone when its New Zealand franchise completed the task earlier this year with drone company Flirtey.\n\nAlong with Flirtey, a company backed by Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ), competition to Google in its drone ambitions comes from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Amazon Prime Air, which successfully delivered a bag of popcorn and Amazon Fire TV Stick to a customer in the United Kingdom earlier this week, leads the way in drone delivery.\n\nAs mentioned above, several companies have successfully delivered items by drone in test runs. Project Wing was one of these successful companies earlier this year when it delivered Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG ) burritos to students at Virginia Tech University. Alphabet has also been a heavy investor in small private companies in the drone sector. From 2012 to 2016, Alphabet trails only Qualcomm for amount invested in the sector for private funding.\n\nNext Page", "Alphabet Inc's Google Goes All-In Into Self-Driving with Waymo.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been involved in developing self-driving vehicles since 2009 as part of its [in]famous moonshot projects. The company reported in 2015 that its self-driving cars had logged more than a million driving miles and established an impeccable safety record. But now for the first time, the company has created an independent self-driving car unit and named it Waymo. Waymo will build on self-driving technologies that the company has been developing at its Google X (moonshot) division. Here's why this moonshot could be the next biggest growth driver for Alphabet Inc and GOOGL stock.\n\nSelf-Driving Vehicles Could Go Mainstream Sooner Than You Think\n\nUnlike Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose self-driving car roadmap is anything but an open book, Alphabet has been quite clear about its autonomous car ambitions. The fact that the company is going all-in into self-driving at a time when Apple has begun scaling down Project Titan signals greater confidence by Alphabet in the autonomous car concept.\n\nSelf-driving cars could actually come sooner than many people think. Lack of a proper regulatory framework has been partly to blame for the slow advancement of the self-driving cars concept. Up until recently, a patchwork of regulation in the U.S. and Europe only allowed for testing of self-driving cars in certain states, cities, and towns.\n\nBut recent advancements in the industry could push it forward by several years. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) released new self-driving car regulations in September. Although these are mere guidelines and not rules, they are a clear indication that NHTSA is willing to work with tech to provide tools that make self-driving a reality sooner than the standard 4-8 years that it takes to introduce comprehensive changes.\n\nAlso Read: GOOGL Stock: Is Facebook Inc Really A Threat To Alphabet Inc?\n\nTop on NHTSA's guidelines is safety. Companies that manufacture autonomous vehicles will be required to sign a 15-point safety checklist to pre-certify their vehicles. But the safety of self-driving vehicles is not likely to become a major concern. So far, self-driving cars have proven to be considerably safer than human-driven vehicles. The global safety record of human-driven vehicles across all models is one death for every 60 million driving miles. Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicles have logged more than 130 million miles on Autopilot, with only one fatality recorded. Meanwhile, Alphabet's autonomous cars have logged a couple of million miles but with only a dozen or so minor accidents with no serious injuries or fatalities yet. Alphabet's impeccable safety record can partly be chalked up to the fact that it's self-driving cars have a speed limit of 25 miles per hour.\n\nSelf-Driving Can Disrupt The Private Automobile Market\n\nUltimately it's not very likely that the superior safety record of autonomous vehicles is going to change for the worse. As people become increasingly comfortable about hitching a ride in driverless cars, self-driving technology will likely disrupt the private automobile market.\n\nAlphabet will use Waymo to explore opportunities in personal vehicles, public transportation, logistics, and ride sharing. Alphabet is, in fact, one of the foremost companies in the autonomous driving field, and graduation of the project into a targeted revenue generating enterprise is a big positive for Google X and GOOGL stock. But perhaps nowhere is the opportunity for self-driving car greater than in the burgeoning shared mobility market, one that is championed by the likes of Uber and Lyft.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, cars will drive 19.6 billion miles globally in 2030, almost double the 10.2 billion miles they travelled in 2015. That growth rate is much faster than the estimated production of light vehicles over the same period which will lead to fast growth in the shared mobility industry. Shared cars accounted for just 4% of global miles travelled in 2015, but will account for nearly 30% by 2030.\n\nAlso Read: AAPL Stock vs GOOGL Stock: Better 2017 Pick- Apple Inc. or Alphabet Inc?\n\nAnd, sharing a ride will gradually become cheaper than owning a car. Currently, it costs $0.76/mile for a self-owned car compared to $1.50/mile for a shared ride. But the tables will eventually turn and by 2030 it will cost $0.50/mile for a shared ride compared with $0.75/mile for a private vehicle. Vehicle sharing is seen as the biggest potential market for autonomous vehicles because they remove the human bottlenecks and improve the economics substantially. Morgan Stanley predicts that the shared mobility market will grow to a $2.6-trillion industry by 2030. In a wildly successful scenario, Alphabet might be able to sell as many self-driving cars in 7-8 years as BMW currently does. BMW sold 1.9 million vehicles in 2015. At an ASP of $75k, that would net the company $142.5B, almost triple its current annual revenue. So that's a solid opportunity for Alphabet. Even 20-30% of that would still present a healthy incremental revenue stream for the company.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nIn the recent past, the future of the autonomous vehicle remained unclear due to lack of a proper regulatory framework that would support mass sales of such vehicles. But with NHTSA starting to move quickly to introduce such regulations, the future of the industry looks bright.\n\nAlphabet is amongst the first companies that are fully dedicated to the self-driving car industry. And now with Waymo the company will be in a better position to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the growing shared mobility market. It will probably take 3-4 years before Alphabet can start selling its autonomous vehicles in large enough volumes. But this is ultimately a long-term catalyst for GOOGL stock.\n\nEvaluating winning tech stocks? Check out our top stock picks, which have beaten the NASDAQ by over 112%.", "Top analyst Victor Anthony at research firm Aegis has come out with a bullish call on shares of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The analyst initiated coverage on GOOGL with a Buy rating and a price target of $980, which implies a potential upside of just under 20% from where the stock is currently trading.\n\nAnthony believes, “Despite Google continuing to benefit from multiple secular tailwinds and management actively repurchasing shares, investors have been reticent to buy into the stock this year due to tough revenue comps and the prospect of margin pressures at the core Google segment. And recently, the Trump impact and FX have been a concern. We see the stock working through these concerns due to growth opportunities in Search as a result of new and enhanced ad formats and AI, continued strength at YouTube, and growth of enterprise cloud computing. The confluence of these should help offset the tough compares and margin pressures from rising traffic acquisitions costs, hardware sales and growth investments.”\n\nIn fact, not only does the analyst dismiss apprehension falling upon Trump and foreign exchange variables and their resultant impact, he sees rapid-fire EPS acceleration bounding from a dip in corporate tax rate as well as a rise in share repurchases, surmising, “if the 60% of Alphabet’s cash domiciled oversees was repatriated and used to aggressively repurchase shares (both subject to several caveats within the Republican tax proposals).”\n\nVictor Anthony has a very good TipRanks score with a 64% success rate and he stands at #67 out of 4,291 analysts. Anthony earns 13.3% in his yearly returns. When recommending GOOGL, Anthony gains 8.7% in average profits on the stock.\n\nTipRanks analytics indicate GOOGL as a Strong Buy. Out of 28 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 26 are bullish on Alphabet stock, 1 remains sidelined, and 1 is bearish on the stock. With a return potential of nearly 19%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $967.50." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1187335022700876, 0.1646819818211571, 0.02403829966329965 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4387419491078028, 0.461655211912944, 0.4524810606060605 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-21T09:45:11.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2016-12-20T04:04:34.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2016-12-21T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

But what about Google’s big advantage over Amazon in the smart home war — all those smartphones?\n\nSource: Google\n\nThe company has just begun rolling out Home Control, a new feature that lets Google Assistant control smart home devices by voice.\n\nHowever, at this point, Home Control — like Google Assistant — remains a feature that’s exclusive to Google’s own Pixel Phones.\n\nThe Battle for the Smart Home\n\nGoogle Home is a connected speaker with Google Assistant baked in. Owners can use Google Assistant on the speaker to answer questions, find music and control a growing number of smart home devices using their voice only.\n\nThe device is GOOGL’s answer to the Amazon Echo. Amazon’s Alexa-enabled speaker has been a surprise hit and allowed Amazon to take a big lead in the race to become the smart home hub — despite the distinct disadvantage of lacking a smartphone platform to host its digital assistant.\n\nGoogle has Google Now and the new Google Assistant, while Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has Siri. Between them, the two companies have billions of mobile devices in consumers’ hands, yet Amazon still managed to leapfrog them with its personal assistant hosted in a speaker, to build an impressive smart home lead.\n\nApple’s Siri can control HomeKit-compatible smart home devices using voice commands, and now GOOGL is rolling out a similar feature for its Google Assistant, Home Control.\n\nHome Control\n\nGoogle’s new feature for voice control of smart devices isn’t actually new. Anyone who owns both a Pixel Phone and a Google Home speaker already had a Home Control setting on their smartphone.\n\nHowever, as of yesterday, GOOGL has begun to roll out Home Control to all Google Assistant users. This amounts to all Pixel Phone owners, since Google Assistant remains an exclusive that third-party Android smartphones don’t get.\n\nWith Home Control, someone with a Pixel Phone gets the same voice control ability for smart devices they would have if they owned a Google Home speaker. They can use voice commands on their phone to change the temperature on their Nest Learning Thermostat or turn off the smart lighting in the room they just left.\n\nThe Battle for the Smart Home Enters a New Phase (Sort of)\n\nAt the start of this fight to be the company that becomes the hub of the smart home — the one who controls all those smart devices — the smartphone was it.\n\nNext Page" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1789177489177489 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4984956709956709 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-02-10T12:36:04.000+0000" } ] }

Following the company’s difficult exit from China in 2010, Alphabet Inc is back and aiming to be a player in the second largest economy’s mobile market with Google Play and its new Pixel phone.\n\nOn the plus side, other Trump pledges regarding the repatriation of overseas cash hordes and cutting corporate tax rates are not only favorable for GOOG stock, but also more likely to gain passage through Congress without much effort.\n\nPlus, if investors just look at GOOG’s stock chart, rather than the bluster of potential threats, you’ll see that things look pretty good.\n\nGOOG Stock Chart\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge It hasn’t always been pretty, but Alphabet’s price action has at least been constructive.\n\nDuring the first half of 2016, GOOG established a large corrective double bottom. That’s typically a welcome event for bulls because it unwinds excessive behavior. The technical reset then went on to forge a breakout attempt in October.\n\nUnfortunately, the move to fresh all-time highs proved short-lived.

The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $820.92, up from yesterday’s close by 0.17%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data.\n\nFundamental Analysis\n\nMoney managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) currently trades with a market capitalization of $558.98 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 22.20 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report.\n\nThe balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For GOOG, the company currently has $12.78 Billion of cash on the books. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $25.83 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $9.53 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 0.35% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nNo analysis is ever complete without a thorough survey of a stock’s technical behavior. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Alphabet Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $853.50. It is now trading 32.58% off that level. The stock is trading $823.30 its 50-day moving average by 2.38%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $663.28.\n\nIn recent action, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has made a move of -0.28% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 1.54, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 0.43% with $598.74 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of GOOG." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.04205535205535205 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3986650386650387 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-29T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

In 2013, Google bought Waze Mobile in a deal valued at $1.1 billion. As of June 2013, there were nearly 50 million Waze users, reported by Yahoo.\n\nWaze is different from Uber and Lyft. It does not work as an on-demand taxi service. Rather, the Waze app is designed to “persuade regular drivers using its navigation app to pick up people who are heading in the same direction,” the WJS reported.\n\n“Can we get the average person on his way to work to pick someone up and drop them off once in a while? That’s the biggest challenge,” Waze CEO Noam Bardin was quoted as saying by the Journal.\n\nMoreover, Waze’s prices are different from Uber and Lyft.\n\nA ride from downtown Oakland, Calif. to downtown San Francisco costs $4.50, where the same trip using either UberPool or Lyft Line is $10.57 and $12.40, respectively, according to the Journal.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) — also known as Google — announced that it will be expanding the locations in which it will test Waze.\n\nThe company said that it is excited to tap into the potential of Waze, a ride-sharing app that has some similarities to Uber and Lyft, but it is ultimately a cheaper alternative to both. The first two tests took place in Tel Aviv and the Bay Area, and they were successful.\n\nThe Waze Rider companion app will be rolled out in a number of US cities over the coming months, as well as Latin America. The Google project first came to fruition in Tel Aviv, where it was developed.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Waze is cheaper and simpler than its rival companies as the plan is to see if the company can get people to pick up and drop someone off on their way to work. “That’s the biggest challenge,” the company mentioned.\n\nA ride in the Bay Area is especially cheap on Waze as you can get from Oakland to downtown San Francisco for $4.50. The same trip with Uber would cost you anywhere between $10 and $12.\n\nWaze has to be booked more in advance than its rivals and it may not be as reliable as other companies. Which one would you rather ride in?\n\nGOOG stock lost 0.7% Thursday, while GOOGL shares slipped 0.7%.", "Google is expanding a carpool service in the U.S. and Latin America through its Waze app in the next several months, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe service, which allows commuters to pick up and drop off extra passengers along their route for a small fee, is often cheaper than ride-hailing apps Uber or Lyft, the Journal reported. But during the pilot programs in Israel and San Francisco, rides needed to be arranged hours in advance, and sometimes, no drivers accepted a request, according to the Journal.\n\nWaze is best known for its mapping app that crowd-sources traffic delays like accidents and construction. Unlike a ride-hailing app, drivers for Waze could not use the app as a full-time income, and the company doesn't currently take a cut of the drivers' pay, according to the Journal.\n\nBut Uber and Google do compete in the market for self-driving cars, which require extensive test driving data.

In the latest indicator of the importance of India as a market to American tech giants, Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Allo messaging app now supports Hindi.\n\nSource: Google\n\nThe market for the consumer products that big technology companies like Google and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) sell is becoming saturated in North America. There are only so many Android phones and and iPhones you can sell here, especially when almost everyone already owns one.\n\nChina or India?\n\nA mature market means the days of record-setting sales quarters are ending.\n\nThats why countries like China and India are looked to for growth. Their populations dwarf that of North America and there’s a growing demand for smartphones.\n\nChina has often been considered the prize. Its population of 1.357 billion is over four times that of the U.S. and wealth has been rapidly building in the country — along with a demand for high-tech gadgets.\n\nHowever, China is a tough nut to crack. It’s home to many competing technology firms like Xiaomi and Oppo that are selling home-grown smartphones at a fraction of the price of an iPhone. The government and its strict policies (including censorship) can be difficult to deal with, as companies from Google to Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) have discovered.\n\nGiven the challenges in China, India has become an increasingly attractive market.\n\nWith a population of 1.25 billion, it is nearly as large as China. Like China, India has a growing economy and an expanding middle class, but India is a decade or more behind China in its econonomic development. So moving on India now means getting in early, unlike China which requires considerable effort to establish a presence.\n\nIn addition, India’s government is seen as being easier to deal with by Western technology companies and India lacks the powerhouse local technology companies that have been taking over the Chinese smartphone market.\n\nGoogle Allo Goes Hindi\n\nThere’s no Chinese version, but Google is now rolling out Hindi support in its Allo messaging app, in a clear nod to the importance it places on the Indian market. As Ars Technica points out, this is just the latest in a series of India firsts for the company.\n\nNext Page", "Analysts at Citi Research recently spoke with search engine marketing agency Merkle and discussed search ad spend trends.

Only 5.6 percent of Cuban homes had either intranet or internet access last year, according to a U.N. agency.\n\nThe Google deal comes as officials in Havana and Washington are working to wrap up pending commercial accords before President Barack Obama leaves office next month.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has threatened to scrap detente between the Cold War foes unless Cuba makes political and other concessions.\n\nImproved bilateral relations have been accomplished through executive orders circumventing trade embargo laws and can easily be reversed by Trump.\n\nThe Obama administration has said it hopes increased commercial links between the two countries will make it difficult for future administrations to undo the recent warming in U.S.-Cuba relations.\n\n(Corrects figure in 9th paragraph on homes connected to internet or Cuba intranet, to 5.6 percent instead of 3.4 percent.)\n\n(Reporting by Marc Frank; Editing by Tom Brown)", "HAVANA, Dec. 13 (UPI) -- The state-run Telecommunications Company of Cuba, or ETECSA, and Alphabet Inc. have signed a deal that will enable the U.S. company to install servers to improve connectivity speeds to Google content.\n\nGranma, the Cuban government's official media agency, said in a statement that ETECSA Executive President Mayra Arevich and Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, Google's parent company, signed the deal on Monday.\n\nThe agreement will provide greater speed and quality for Google services such as Google Mail (Gmail) and YouTube.\n\nGoogle's first venture in Cuba began in 2014, when it launched services such as Google Chrome, Google Play and Google Analytics.\n\nCuba and Google agreed to the deal on Nov. 23. U.S. President Barack Obama formally announced his administration was working to normalize relations with Cuba in December 2014.

For the past year, Alphabet has outperformed the Zacks Internet-Services industry. GOOGL has returned 12.68% compared with the industry’s return of 11.89%.\n\nBloomberg reported on Monday that the sale is likely an equity transaction with Alphabet keeping a stake in Planet Labs.\n\nFormerly known as Skybox, the earth imaging company was founded in 2009 and the search giant bought it for $500 million in 2014, the same year when Skybox was named no. 1 on Inc. magazine’s 25 Most Audacious Companies.\n\nGetting Rid of Audacious Ventures\n\nThe move underscores Alphabet’s efforts to trim relatively less-revenue generating businesses and attain financial discipline.\n\nIn Aug 2015, Alphabet reportedly curbed expansion of its high-speed fiber optic Internet network, cutting 9% of its staff. In November, the company scaled back Project Wing, its experimental drone delivery program.\n\nWhat’s on Planet’s Platter?\n\nPrivately held Planet operates with dozens of small satellites that take pictures of the Earth surface frequently. However, the resolution of the images is low. Terra Bella has larger satellites with high image resolution but its fleet contains only seven satellites, which limits the frequency of capturing images.\n\nThus, we believe that through this acquisition, Planet Labs will add high resolution satellites to its fleet. Both companies share the satellite imaging space with giants like Airbus’ (OTCMKTS: EADSY ) Airbus Defence & Space and DigitalGlobe Inc (NYSE: DGI ).\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nAlphabet’s sales, marketing and R&D expenses have gone up considerably in the last five years. There are also some other margin pressures. The most significant at the moment is related to currency, which continued to impact Alphabet’s results despite the fact that it has a hedging program in place.\n\nAlphabet Inc. EPS Diluted (TTM)\n\nOther expense pressures include fast-paced international growth, a growing volume of lower-priced YouTube clicks and strength of the mobile platform. So we believe that Alphabet has foreseen an escalation of costs in the years to come and is gearing up well in advance with decisions like these.\n\nNext Page" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.02224137931034483 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4197126436781609 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-01-11T13:18:00.000+0000" } ] }

(GOOG) Position Reduced by Feltz Wealth PLAN Inc." ], "article_text" : [ "All too much like James Cameron’s 2009 sci-fi flick Avatar, just when you think the feud between Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL ) is over, you find out it’s not.* Last week, the iconic database company told the iconic search engine company it was appealing a ruling made against Oracle — in favor of Alphabet — in May of last year.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFor better or worse, GOOGL stock owners either didn’t hear, or didn’t care. If it’s the latter, it’s not terribly surprising. The company formerly known as Google is sued on a regular basis, often by parties with weak cases just looking for a payday.\n\nGOOGL shareholders may want to take a closer look this time around though. While successful appeal cases are tough, Oracle’s argument holds slightly more water than the typical long-shot case like the one Vringo levied (and ultimately lost) back in 2014. Moreover, the case itself could have significant repercussions for other outfits in the heat of similar arguments about open source software.\n\nGOOGL: Here We Go Again\n\nWarning: You may need to read through the intricacies of this case twice to fully understand what’s going on, and even then, there’s no guarantee it will make complete sense. Here’s the crux of the argument though … Oracle says Alphabet used a little too much of its Java software — which is free, open-source software — in its Android operating system.\n\nThe suit largely hinges on what constitutes “fair use” of open-source and freely-available software.\n\nWhile Oracle offers Java for any consumer to download and any developer to utilize pieces of, the company contends it was never intended for wide swaths of the code to be cut and pasted and utilized as part of a commercial, revenue-bearing system. The complaint specifically read:\n\n“The undisputed evidence showed that Google verbatim copied the heart of Oracle’s creative work for an entirely commercial purpose without any change to Oracle’s expressive content or message, took far more than necessary to program in the Java language, and, in so doing, harmed the market for Java.”\n\nThe strength of Oracle’s copyrights on its application programming interfaces, or APIs, was particularly emphasized by the company in the prior jury trial.\n\nAlphabet’s counterargument is simpler — CEO Larry Page said, “We didn’t pay for the free and open things.”\n\nIf all of this rings a bell with GOOGL stock owners, there’s a reason. This argument has been waged in a courtroom a few times, going back as far as 2010. The current stage for this battle of the titans is an appeal of last year’s loss suffered by Oracle. That case’s loss likely saved Alphabet Inc from being forced to pay the $9 billion in damages Oracle was seeking.\n\nBottom Line for GOOGL Stock, and Others\n\nOwners of GOOGL stock don’t have a great deal to worry about here. The courts sided with the company in the most recent case, and appeals — a reversal of a prior judgment — are very difficult win.\n\nNext Page", "Many Alphabet Inc.(GOOG) Stock Research Financial Advisors from Investment Banking firms have advised their client and investors on the stock.

Although, the firm notes there also was a 15% dip in click-through-rates.\n\nFrom Anthony’s standpoint, “The CTR decline was attributed to the jump in impression growth. Mobile was the key driver with spend increasing 69% YoY, desktop increasing 5%, while tablet spend declined 28% YoY (bid modifier effect). The retail and finance verticals were very strong while travel was flat and education spend was down YoY. IgnitionOne is expecting healthy growth in search in 2017.”\n\nOverall, “Both IgnitionOne and RKG reported accelerating growth in search spend in 4Q16, suggesting that Google search growth is very strong this quarter. Add to that, strong growth at YouTube given that app tracking data show a sharp jump in MAUs in 4Q (see our last GOOGL note for details), we see Alphabet reporting strong FX-neutral results,” Anthony concludes.\n\nFollowing the conference call, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on GOOGL with a price target of $980, which represents a 21% increase from where the shares last closed.\n\nVictor Anthony has a very good TipRanks score with a 63% success rate and he stands at #78 out of 4,289 analysts. Anthony garners 12.9% in his annual returns. When recommending GOOGL, Anthony earns 8.5% in average profits on the stock.\n\nTipRanks analytics indicate GOOGL as a Strong Buy. Based on 27 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 25 are bullish on Alphabet stock, 1 remains sidelined, and 1 is bearish on the stock.

Level 4 and level 5 automated vehicles are even further out. For a look at the SAE’s levels of driving automation, see the graphic below.\n\nA level 3 car designed for drivers to take their hands off the wheel and eyes off the road – for extended periods of time – is promised by Audi (owned by Volkswagen) to be out later in 2017.\n\nBut what about vehicles from Silicon Valley?\n\nWaymo: Ahead of Rivals\n\n\n\nThe foremost player here is Waymo, the autonomous car company owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nAt the recent annual Detroit Auto Show, Waymo revealed it had built all of its self-driving sensor hardware itself. This puts the company ahead of rivals such as Uber in the race to perfect driverless vehicle technology.\n\nJohn Krafcik, the CEO of Waymo, said this signaled an “inflection point” for the company,as this will dramatically reduce the cost (possibly up to 90%) of its autonomous vehicles. That is certainly an important step in the move toward commercialization of such vehicles.\n\nKrafcik added that building the hardware and software together was crucial in improving accuracy. Or in other words, safety.\n\nThis is not good news for all the auto parts providers that were looking to cash in on autonomous vehicles. This includes the likes of Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) and Delphi Automotive (NYSE: DLPH).\n\nIt’s a win-win scenario. Alphabet won’t have to get into car making business and automakers could just plug in Waymo technology into its vehicles without spending a penny for the platform’s development.\n\nSmart Moves by Waymo\n\n\n\nThere is one other reason I like Waymo’s approach to autonomous vehicles.\n\nIt says that its vehicles will be unplugged from the internet for the majority of time, lowering the chances of these vehicles being hacked.\n\nCEO Krafcik told the Financial Times, “Our cars communicate with the outside world only when they need to, so there isn’t a continuous line that’s able to be hacked, going into the car.”\n\nHacking risks rise as more and more sophisticated and connected technology is put into our cars. Once hackers get in via an internet connection – such as a connected radio – they can then take control of critical functions like steering or braking.\n\nOver the past few years, automakers including General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F), Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) have all reported car hacking vulnerabilities to varying degrees.\n\nThis shouldn’t come as a shock – these firms are not technology companies, they are car makers.\n\nA three-year study from cyber security company IOActive found that more than half of car components had “flaws” that could be exploited by hackers to control parts of a vehicle’s key functions.\n\nThe leader of the research, Corey Thuen, said “Every system or component that we tested had at least one vulnerability.” That is scary!\n\nEspecially if one considers that some automakers like BMW (OTC:BMWYY) has said that 5G networks will be essential because its vehicles will need to transmit data constantly and communicate with other vehicles.\n\nAlphabet’s Waymo cars doesn’t require communications infrastructure. They are intended to be nearly completely self-reliant. Its vehicles will only have to open a link to the cloud to send or receive pertinent information such as traffic reports.\n\nThat seems the safer route to me than the approach of others in building self-driving cars. This is just another reason to own Alphabet for the long-term.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) closed at $828.17 on Friday, up $3.80 (+0.46%). Year-to-date, GOOGL has gained 4.51%, versus a 1.44% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.\n\nThis article is brought to you courtesy of Wyatt Investment Research." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1129188712522046 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.5429232804232804 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-01-21T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

(NASDAQ: AMZN ) — the dominant name in the category — is not alone anymore. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) this week announced its cloud presence with authority, boasting a list of prominent client wins, including Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) and eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY ).\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAt the company’s Google Cloud Next conference keynote, Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt declared, “We’re here for real.” He added, “[Google] has the money, the means and the commitment to pull off a new platform of computation globally, for everybody who needs it.”\n\nThe Mountain View-based company calls Google Cloud, which is third behind No. 2 cloud player, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), its next growth engine. Google CEO Sundar Pichai deemed the platform as an “extraordinarily big bet.”\n\nTo that end, Alphabet, which on Thursday unveiled an enterprise version of its Google Hangouts messaging platform called “Hangouts Chat,” must find ways to convince current and would-be enterprise clients that Google Cloud is the platform they belong on.\n\nGOOGL Stock\n\nDespite the strong revenue Alphabet generates, Google’s cloud revenue, which is estimated to have a run rate of only $1 billion, according to Recode. The company ended fiscal 2016 with revenue of $90.27 billion.\n\nBy contrast, market leader Amazon’s Web Services last year surpassed an annual run rate of $12 billion. Notably, Google Cloud’s $1 billion run rate is still about one-third of Microsoft’s $2.7 billion. But all of this means that Google still has tons of room for growth. Over the past year, the company has landed cloud clients such as Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS ), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD ) and even rival Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ).\n\nWhy are these industry titans important to Google?\n\nAccording to IDC, worldwide spending on public cloud services is expected to soar to more than $195 billion by 2020, more than doubling the revenue of 2016. “Cloud software will significantly outpace traditional software product delivery over the next five years, growing nearly three times faster than the software market as a whole and becoming the significant growth driver to all functional software markets,” said Benjamin McGrath, senior research analyst, SaaS and Business Models.\n\nMeanwhile, Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin forecasts public cloud spending, currently around $58 billion annually, will triple to $205 billion in the next three years. As Google’s cloud business grows, GOOGL stock will too.\n\nBottom Line for Alphabet\n\nGOOGL stock closed Thursday at $857.84, up 0.49%. The shares have risen 8.7% year to date, while climbing 17.6% over the past year. These aren’t breathtaking returns when compared to the almost 50% one-year gains Amazon stock has delivered, but Alphabet looks poised to make up ground if the company can realize its cloud ambitions.\n\nAs of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.", "\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Has Enormous Upside Relative to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB)\n\n\n\nGoogle Has Upside and Wall Street is Missing It\n\n2017-03-08\n\nWhile the smartphone numbers we looked at above are interesting, it's all really just conversation for Google.\n\n\n\nThe company has essentially zero footprint in the smartphone market with respect to actual hardware, so even if smartphones were shrinking, the opportunity for Google is to go from \"zero\" to some number greater than zero, and that opportunity is big.\n\nLet Tesla sell its 500,000 cars by 2018 if they can. Alphabet Inc is looking to sell tens of millions within five years, with no cost of production, no assembly line, no radical new business - just the best technology in the world licensed to the largest auto makers in the world.\n\n\n\nNow, this isn't done but it's definitely starting and Wall Street is miles behind (no pun intended).\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: TechCrunch YouTube's average video length may be quite constrained, but in aggregate, viewers are watching a billion hours of its clips per day.

Here is a chart of both metrics:The bars represent revenue (TTM) and the orange line traces net income (TTM), which in English is after tax profit. But, just as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has faced concerns over a diversification of its revenue stream with respect to the iPhone, and as Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) has faced concerns of slowing revenue and earnings growth due to a lack of diversification, so too has Alphabet Inc faced those concerns.That mountain of revenue is about 80% from advertising. Most of that advertising comes from Google's Search, and there has been a concern that as search has moved to mobile, Google has less control over the ecosystem which could give way to Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone, if the company so chose, to move away from Google, and it also means Google now faces advertising competition from Facebook's enormous user base, and even, oddly, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).But, Google has a secret weapon -- in fact, it has, and each has the potential to make up a large cap tech company in and of themselves. We can start with the simple, and move to the breaking news at the end.First, there is this absurd narrative circling that smartphones are doomed to be the next PCs - a dying technology replaced with newer looks, designs and specs. Here is the PC market via our friends at Statista:The PC market is in decline and will continue to be. But, friends, that is not at all emblematic of the smartphone market. Check out this chart from Statista.I don't know what else to say other than, the smartphone market is growing, not shrinking.We wrote a dedicated dossier to Google's new Pixel smartphone Google Has a Huge New Upside Weapon . In that dossier we note the obvious, but somehow wildly misunderstood reality that Wall Street is missing:We must understand that simply launching a smartphone does not mean it will work. Just ask Microsoft. But, as we discuss in that dossier above, Google has done more than just \"launch a phone.\"Let's call it an even split at the high end for smartphones, meaning between Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung, about 450 million high end phones have been sold in the last year by the two dominant players.Alphabet Inc's Google Pixel has been given the imprimatur of the tech critic crowd, placing it directly in competition with the Android Samsung flagships and the Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones. In English, the Google Pixel is a legitimate substitution threat.We'll stop here so not wax rhapsodic (and not to repeat ourselves), but the smartphone market has made Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) the largest company in the world, even a little piece of that market for Alphabet Inc could mean fully a 25% rise in revenue from this opportunity alone. The Pixel 2 was just announced and will be here in 2017.After all of that, you could make an argument thatWe wrote a dossier It's Time to Focus on Google's Cars . In that piece we uncover the magnificence that is Waymo.In the last couple of months Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has spun out its self-driving car segment into a stand-alone company, still under the Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) umbrella, called Waymo. Before we dig into the details, a quick step back. This is the expected growth in the market for self-driving featured cars:For the longest time this project felt like one of the many moonshots that would never really see the light of day - that's what Wall Street would have had us think, at least. But it isn't a moonshot, it's a business - and a rather large one.It was lost in the wind of headlines, but Alphabet inc has already started talks with General Motors and Ford as well as Honda and Chrysler-Fiat. As we note from that dossier:In our recent dossier Google is Gunning for the Cloud , we discuss at length the moves Alphabet Inc is putting on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft to snap that market into its own hands.While the cloud has become more like a colloquialism than a name for a technology, the tailwinds to this technological shift are simply unstoppable at this point. There is too much data and too many connected devices even today, not to speak of the absurdity that is to come, to not have a machine learning driven technology to balance the needs of every website, every app, all the data in complete harmony. Enter the cloud.The worldwide public cloud market is forecast to rise from $154 billion this year to nearly half a trillion dollars by 2026. Right now, there are two distinct leaders. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the undisputed leader and right behind the e-commerce giant is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Here is a market share chart:While the mainstream media will talk about the battle between Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation, the third place company is none other than Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).We won't belabor the point here since it is written nice and neat in the dossier noted above, but the point is that the cloud computing market is going to be enormous, and Google has an advantage over both of the incumbents -- there simply is no company that has made more progress in the world of end-to-end machine learning and artificial intelligence than Google.The demands of the cloud will very soon go well past \"having a bunch of servers in a room,\" and well into the realm of advanced analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. With over 25 billion devices soon to be connected in the Internet of Things, don't be surprised to see Google as the new leader in the cloud -- with an advantage that goes well beyond a well formed API structure and cost savings.Now, that was three of the four secret weapons for Google -- but friends, number four may be larger than all of them.It's just a matter of fact that cord-cutting is coming. In fact, here is a nice visual we put together with data from Statista:Everything from cord-cutters, to people never having cable, to the number of cable subscribers is pointing in the obvious direction of a need for a new way to deliver TV. And Google is the company with an undisputed lead that it may never relinquish.YouTube has more viewers aged 18-49, now listen carefully,than any other network or cable broadcast channel in the United States. Here's what new data just showed:That reality led to one of the biggest stories in technology of the last five years that somehow has received very little notice. On February 28th we learned that Google has partnered to create \"YouTubeTV.\" And what is this new \"YouTube TV?\" It's astreaming TV service that will up end cable.Then CNBC added some more flavor:The most recent data puts cable TV subscriptions at just under 50 million, and subscribers to cable broadband now at 55 million. If we use 50 million as our base, that puts the total addressable market (TAM) for Google at 50 million * $40 /month = $2 billion a month, or $24 billion a year,Let's keep our eyes on the ball, here. Alphabet Inc is still an advertising first company, and there is risk to that business as mobile becomes a bigger part, if not the central part, and the ad blocking phenomenon also grows.Further, all of these opportunities, taken as one business at a time, are yet to be proven as winners for Alphabet Inc, although the cloud and YouTube are doing quite well already.If this is the kind of research you seek, beyond all the click bait that clutters the world of \"news,\" then what we offer may be up your alley: Our research sits side-by-side with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, JP Morgan, and the rest on professional terminals as a part of the famed Thomson First Call group.

After all, GOOGL had stolen many plays from Apple Inc.‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) playbook. Just like Apple, the company came to the fray with the Google Pixel and the Google Pixel XL with screen sizes of 5 inches and 5.5 inches, respectively.\n\nSource: Google\n\nBut Google was not content to just copy a few iPhone moves. The marketing strategies employed by the two companies are remarkably similar:\n\nBoth lay claim to being the smartest smartphones on the planet,\n\nBoth claim to have the best cameras in their class,\n\nBoth sport rather humdrum designs that are nevertheless pretty impressive par the course nowadays and,\n\nBoth are pretty darn expensive, with the unlocked base 32GB versions starting and $649 for both smartphones.\n\nGOOGL though has one-upped Apple by adding a touch of exclusivity to the Pixel to differentiate it from other Android phones. This includes special features such as a Pixel Launcher, Google Assistant and Daydream. By now, you might be wondering — what kind of affect does this have on GOOGL stock?\n\nNot so Fast, Google Pixel\n\nNot surprisingly, Google Pixel hit the ground running. Many GOOGL stock investors were willing to bet that the company’s first smartphone ever was on track to knock Apple down a peg or two after years of dominance in the smartphone business. Pixel managed to garner many glowing reviews, with The Verge declaring it ‘‘hit a homerun,” while Ars Technica described it as the ”best Android smartphone ever.”\n\nBut current indications are that the victory dance was a bit premature. Some numbers coming from Wall Street suggest that Pixel is unlikely to live up to the iPhone-killer hype. Morgan Stanley has come up with estimates that Google will sell a respectable 3 million Pixels worth $2 billion during the final three months of 2016, but only 5 million to 6 million for the whole of 2017 once the initial enthusiasm wears off.\n\nComparatively, Apple sold 212 million iPhone units in fiscal year 2016 netting $137 billion in revenue. Further, Apple averaged 41% gross margin for the iPhone in 2016, almost double the 22% to 25% range analysts are modeling for the Pixel depending on the configuration. So what Pixel will add to Google’s top and bottom lines really is a drop in the bucket compared with the iPhone, a device that brings in 60% of total Apple revenues.\n\nBut these disappointing projections should probably not come as a surprise to GOOGL stock owners. Most smartphone users tend to be very loyal to their brands, and the next handsets they buy are largely dictated by past purchases.\n\nClose to 90% of consumers that currently own an iPhone are likely to stick to the Apple ecosystem; ditto for the Android camp. Moreover, asking the average Android smartphone user to upgrade to a Pixel is going to be a tough sell. The Android smartphone average selling price hovers around $250, less than half the price of an entry-level Pixel.\n\nNext Page" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1081175511731067 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4947016460905349 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-08T13:52:30.000+0000" } ] }

Here Is Why." ], "article_text" : [ "Android, from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), is the dominant mobile operating system. It runs on nearly nine of every 10 mobile phones, worldwide. But that’s never really been a primary reason to by GOOGL stock … or at least not directly.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFrom an investor standpoint, you would still rather buy Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) because Apple monetizes iOS the way a butcher monetizes a pig. Google, on the other hand, just gives its OS away to OEMs.\n\nThat’s not to say Google doesn’t make any money off Android, though. Simply by offering its search engine and Google Play store through the software, GOOGL rakes in billions of dollars.\n\nBut, the Android ecosystem is extremely fragmented. Compared to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) — which runs its own store and has its own browser and search engine — Google’s take is a mere fraction.\n\nWhat if that changed? Would it mean anything to GOOGL stock holders?\n\nControlling Android\n\nWhile Google is not yet charging OEMs to use its software, the company has been quietly trying to gain control of its creation. Management is pushing OEMs to deliver security updates on a monthly basis. This is important, as crooks push malware onto older, unpatched phones.\n\nGoogle’s newest handset, the Pixel, is designed to be as good as an iPhone. Reviews, however, have been mixed. The company is even trying to get back into China through its OEMs (the world’s largest market tossed Google back in 2010 over censorship).\n\nStill, Google has its work cut out for itself. Samsung Electronic (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) dominates the Android market. OEMs and consumers see this fragmentation as an advantage, even though it allows bugs to multiply because they may appear on one device or brand only.\n\nThe operating system itself is hopelessly fragmented. Google is only now rolling out its Marshmallow and Nougat versions of Android and still developing the “O” version, while many users have devices that still run the KitKat version. My own Android phone runs on Lollipop, (simply because it lacks the storage to run anything newer).\n\nThe way Google eventually gets its arms around all of this may be through Andromeda, an operating system for both Android and its laptop Chromebook devices. Unifying software platforms would give Alphabet Inc the kind of power that Microsoft only dreamed of with its Windows operating system.\n\nBottom Line on GOOGL Stock\n\nIf Alphabet were to start monetizing Android, would investors even notice?\n\nAlphabet continues to grow at 20% per year, powered by advertising on its main Search site and YouTube. The company brings approximately 25 cents of every dollar to the net income line, its balance sheet carries almost no debt, and operating cash flow is ridiculous ($36 billion last year alone, more than twice what it achieved just two years prior). In 2016, Alphabet had revenue in excess of $90 billion.\n\nNext Page", "Alphabet Inc stock is likely to outperform in 2017.\n\n\n\nFlickr\n\nShares of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had a much better start to 2017 after finishing 2016 with just a modest return of 2%. Investors did not bid GOOGL stock higher in 2016 even after the company posted continuous double-digit revenue growth throughout the year. GOOGL stock is already up more than 8% YTD and we believe it is most likely to outperform in 2017. While Alphabet Inc's search and digital advertising businesses continue to be key revenue drivers for the tech behemoth, some latest developments suggest many more key growth drivers for the company going ahead. These new growth drivers suggest GOOGL stock could be headed much higher. Here's Why.\n\nYouTube To Bring In More Ad Dollars Now.\n\nAlphabet Inc's video platform YouTube recently unveiled YouTube TV, its live TV streaming service. The subscription costs $35-a-month for a package of 40-plus channels. However, there are a quite a few holes in the YouTube offering. As it does not include some of the major networks like AMC Networks, Discovery Communications, Time Warner, A+E Networks and Viacom networks and this service is not available in all regions of US, an incremental roll-out is planned. However, this is a step in the right direction. YouTube was the biggest driver of ad revenue growth for Alpahbet Inc in 2016. Alphabet Inc does not disclose the break up of revenue from YouTube alone but Jefferies analysts calculated that it brought in about $12 billion in revenue last year. With YouTube TV now, Google can have a crack at the TV ad market.\n\nThough the advertising details of YouTube TV have not been disclosed, industry experts see YouTube helping Google get a pie of the TV ad market. William Blair‘s Ralph Schackert is very bullish over the long-term about YouTube's latest offering as he points out \"TV advertising is a $185 billion annual market, and pay TV is $275 billion, therefore, both are very attractive markets for YouTube to chip away at over the longer term.\" The TV ad market would be extra add dollars YouTube would bring, in addition to the ones it is currently making on its platform. According to the latest data disclosed, people now watch 1 billion hours of YouTube per day. The rise in viewing hours could help it grow revenues at a much faster pace.\n\nAnother key point to note here is that with YouTube TV you also get many other value added benefits, one of them being access to YouTube Red, a $10 per month original content service from YouTube. A recent study also suggests original content is helping Google’s YouTube get new subscribers. However crowded the competition Youtube's offering is likely to appeal to a niche audience. If AT&T’s DirecTV Now which was so buggy at launch can manage to \"acquire 200,000 subscribers in its first month, without impacting its rivals’ growth,\" according to Sling TV CEO Roger Lynch, then YouTube is expected to do much better than that. If that happens to be true, then as William Blair‘s Ralph Schackert suggests, YouTube may receive \"a warm reception from TV advertisers\".\n\nAlphabet's Recent Upgrade To AA-plus Corporate Credit Rating Is A Bullish Signal.\n\nAlphabet Inc was recently upgraded to AA-plus corporate credit rating at S&P Global. Alphabet's latest rating is only one rating below Standard & Poor's AAA rating, the scale's highest level. This highest level rating is only exclusively awarded to Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson. This upgrade clearly suggests the strong future outlook of the tech giant. To quote S&P Global analyst David Tsui: \"The ratings upgrade reflects Alphabet’s consistently strong operating performance, despite a challenging and evolving digital advertising market, while it continues to maintain a conservative financial policy and strong liquidity profile.\" All this adds to many growth drivers in front of the parent body of the search engine giant Google. Alphabet Inc's next growth cycle could be closer than we think. As a Motley Fool post highlights, Alphabet’s Waymo leads the field in driverless car space and \"could be moving toward monetization sooner than anyone else.\"\n\nSumming It Up.\n\nGOOGL stock has made a good start to the year and in a recent research note, Goldman Sachs reiterated their buy rating on shares of Alphabet Inc with a price target of $970.00. This reaffirms the belief that GOOGL stock is headed higher. With YouTube TV, Google may work itself into a position of strength to tap into the massive TV ad market, which could help revenues grow faster than expected. In Waymo, Alphabet Inc may soon find its next big growth driver with the driverless car trend picking up pace. As a The Street post points out with Alphabet trading at a forward multiple of 22, GOOGL stock \"comes at a massive bargain to the internet service and software peer group average of 48 times which is heavily skewed by Amazon's astronomical forward price-to-earnings ratio of 117.\" This is after taking into account projected 19% EPS growth of GOOGL stock over the next 5 years. Hence, long-term investors should buy GOOGL stock, and buy more of it on every dip.\n\nLooking for great tech stocks?

Along with the new OS, which incorporates advanced features like Google Assistant, new Google smartwatch hardware was announced. Made in partnership with LG, the new devices are premium quality, made to take full advantage of Android Wear 2.0 and ready to take on the Apple Watch.\n\nSource: Google\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nGoogle knows it didn’t exactly hit the ball out of the park when it first released its Android Wear smartwatch OS. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has dominated the smartwatch market since its release and despite an overall cooling for smartwatches in general, it looks as though Apple Watch absolutely destroyed the competition over Christmas.\n\nThat has to be especially galling to Google, considering the Apple Watch is only compatible with iPhones, while Android Wear smartwatches work with nearly 90% of the smartphones being sold today. And while Apple Watch remains locked into a clunky square watch face, Android Wear supports the traditional, round wristwatch look.\n\nAndroid Wear 2.0 Key Features\n\nGoogle was originally supposed to release Android Wear 2.0 last September, but decided to delay it to this spring. The official announcement landed yesterday afternoon on GOOGL’s blog.\n\nWhat did Google engineers spend the extra time working on? It appears that they had several major goals: improving on the basic features most smartwatch owners use (such as fitness tracking), cutting the cord to a smartphone with LTE support, and making Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches as compatible as possible with the iPhone.\n\nKey features Google is showing off include:\n\nImproved fitness tracking with Google Fit app\n\nLTE support for running apps and making voice calls directly from a smartwatch without requiring connection to a smartphone\n\nGoogle Assistant is integrated\n\nCustomizable watch face components\n\nGoogle Play access direct from smartwatch\n\nSupport for hardware control similar to Apple Watch digital crown\n\nIn particular, the ability for more apps to run independently on Android Wear 2.0 devices — with no need to be connected to a smartwatch — means iPhone users will get almost the same experience as Android phone owners.

Indoor location solutions are currently being rolled out in retail stores to help customers find products, in malls to help customers find stores and help friends find each other, in airports to help travelers find their gates, and much more.\n\nThe Waze Beacons are the first time that indoor location technology is being used commercially to help automobile navigation in GPS-deprived places. The beacons transmit unique identifying data that the Waze app, running on phones in cars, receives and uses to estimate location. The beacons do not receive any data; all the calculation happens on the phones. The beacon signals can also, in principle, be received and utilized by other apps.\n\nWith GPS signals unavailable in tunnels, navigation applications and devices in cars cannot update their location as they move through the tunnels. In tunnels that include exits and turns, such as Boston's Central Artery and Chicago's Lower Loop, the GPS systems will be unable to navigate drivers through the turns. Even in tunnels that just go from point A to point B, such as New York's Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the lack of updated location positioning means that apps cannot warn you about turns you need to make immediately after leaving the tunnel. This is the problem that Waze engineer Gil Disatnik set out to solve. The result was Waze Beacons.\n\nRegular Wi-Fi access points and Bluetooth beacons were not up to the task of moving cars. One challenge related to the speed of moving cars. Bluetooth beacon signals are generally received with a delay of 1-2 seconds, if not more. This may not be a problem while walking around a mall or an airport, but in 2 seconds a car moving at 55 mph (90 kmh) will travel 50 meters, which is 10 meters more than the 40 meter range that most Bluetooth devices deliver. This means that before a smartphone in a car is able to read a Bluetooth signal, it will move out of range and have to start processing the next beacon's signal.\n\nAnother set of challenges revolved around mounting beacons on tunnel walls. First, the beacons had to be strong enough not to be damaged by tunnel cleaners or flying objects. Second, concrete tunnel walls reflect Bluetooth signals and de-tune the antenna, sending the signal back to the transmitter and interfering with the signals.\n\nThese problems were solved by Waze in partnership with their partner in the project, beacon maker Bluvision (recently acquired by HID Global), which created a customized patch antenna with a large ground plane, which can transmit towards the cars without interference from the tunnel walls.\n\nThe Waze team also worked hard on having the beacons be easy to install. Requiring a tunnel to be closed for installation and maintenance would not be effective for rollout. The solution to this problem involved reducing the physical installation time to one minute per beacon. They also reduced configuration time by crowdsourcing configuration through Waze apps driving by.\n\nThe resulting system enables Waze to monitor car locations in tunnels to an accuracy of 13 meters, roughly the distance a car travels in half a second at 55 mph. They did this by simplifying the location positioning problem to a one dimensional one. This is certainly accurate enough for Waze to give navigation instructions effectively. The beacons should operate for up to 6 years without maintenance.\n\nWaze is not saying much about their rollout of Waze beacons in tunnels worldwide, but discussions with city governments and other government authorities are underway. Waze is working with governments and other tunnel owners to market the new capabilities. Grizzly Analytics reports almost 200 companies working on technology for location positioning in GPS-less environments, and the Waze beacons are the first to address the practical issues presented by cars driving in tunnels in a practical solution.\n\nWhat other in-tunnel uses can Waze Beacons have? One likely possibility is self-driving cars, based on Google's or other's R&D, which integrate several technologies for location positioning both on ground and underground. If deployed widely, Waze Beacons could give self-driving cars a strong corroborating source of location data.\n\nWhat will be next? Now that Waze has beacons that can be effectively installed in tunnels and other underground places, where else can they be installed usefully? Unfortunately, the Waze team isn't talking. But it is easy to see how useful beacons could be in underground parking, underpasses, GPS-challenged areas of big cities, and other areas where GPS signals are not available. In underground parking garages, Waze Beacons could enable car-finding applications, as well as enabling Waze to start routing before reaching the garage exit.\n\nBluetooth also has an advantage of being much lower power consumption on the phone than GPS. Over time, if beacons are installed in above-ground public areas, the same technology that works inside tunnels can enable Waze (or Google Maps or other apps) to offer location services with less power usage than GPS currently requires.\n\nMore esoterically, I believe that Waze beacons are another step in the direction of Google establishing ownership over the complete information chain. Waze is an independent subsidiary of Google, but the ownership is Google's. GPS signals are public, and Waze Beacon signals can be read by anyone, but Waze beacons will give Google ownership of information that will be theirs even as they choose to share.\n\nGoogle has been very adept at leveraging their control of information all along the chain. It would presumably not be hard for Android to use Waze Beacons to provide location positioning to all Android apps while cars are underground.\n\nDoes this effect Google's competition with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)? Apple has purchased several indoor location companies in recent years, two of which gave them technology for self-learning GPS-less location positioning, one based on Bluetooth and one on visual data. But Apple is not competing in the area of navigation applications.\n\nFor the public, Waze beacons are going to be great, extending the reach of mapping and navigation applications. Time will tell what other applications Google has for this technology, and what the technology will enable next. Whatever that is, Google will own it." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.08962259639585221 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3880269923874575 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-27T16:39:44.000+0000" } ] }

Alphabet Inc teamed up with Fiat Chrysler to put its self-driving technology in a 100 Chrysler minivans. This serves as both a test for the self-driving car technology, and the earliest part of a potential blockbuster deal. Then we got this:As we wrote in that dossier:\"It was lost in the wind of headlines, but Alphabet has already started talks with General Motors and Ford as well. Now, imagine for a moment that the self-driving revolution, which is coming much sooner than Wall Street understands, is driven by Alphabet's technology.Yeah, Tesla will have their cars, and likely Apple as well, but Chrysler, Honda and possibly other manufacturers partnering with Alphabet Inc could mean a leader has already been established.Let Tesla sell its 500,000 cars by 2018 if they can. Alphabet is looking to sell tens of millions within five years, with no cost of production, no assembly line, no radical new business - just the best technology in the world licensed to the largest auto makers in the world.\"That was actually review, here is the new information we learned:But that was the distraction. The real news is that Alphabet is finally going after Uber. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is going to use the semi-autonomous Chrysler Pacifica fleet as a ride-hailing service. Waymo's next move is going to be to let people \"use our vehicles to do everyday things like run errands, commute to work, or get safely home after a night on the town.\"That new build out with Fiat Chrysler looks like it's actually going to happen. But we got even more news from Google last week: The company has rolled out a new retail partnership with BMW and the Gap to deploy its 3-D-scanning project called 'Tango'.The idea here is virtual shopping as a replacement or addition to 'real' shopping. The vision is pretty clear with automobiles and it's nice to see Google going further with standard retail. \"A new app allows shoppers to test clothes from the Gap brand using Tango.\"There are limited audiences for this technology right now, but looking to the future is always the right move for technology.This business, the self-driving car business, along with a possible new line with the Google Pixel smartphone, which we wrote about in our dossier Wall Street is Blind to Google's Upside Potential is finally giving us an eye to Alphabet's broader diversification strategy.But there is risk to Alphabet Inc -- one that's growing and one that is existential.(1) Google is losing a sizable piece of its business to Amazon in one particular area: e-commerce search, according to Eugene Kim of Business Insider.(2) Google better straighten out the 'fake news' phenomenon. As I stated ever so clearly on CBC with Peter Armstrong, if Google Search is no longer a trusted source of content, Google is dead. Of course, that's a radical take on it -- we just note that the company better make strides here, and we believe they will.Here is that interview for convenience (link on MSN Money) Alphabet remains aTop Pick and we remain bullish on the company long-term.

So far, Waymo has cut a deal with one carmaker, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, to outfit vehicles with its full self-driving kit, including hardware and software.\n\nIn the future, would Waymo sell hardware – like its new, cheaper LiDAR sensors – to other companies?\n\n”Possibly,” John Krafcik, Waymo’s chief executive officer, said in an interview with Bloomberg News on Jan 9.\n\nThe strategy would be a departure for the Google parent, which has touted its own complete autonomous vehicles in the past, not specific components. Sensor sales would give Waymo another crack at industry deals. Some carmakers, including Ford Motor Co, have balked during partnership talks over disagreements about data sharing, people familiar with the discussions have said.\n\nWaymo’s decision to build its own sensors, radar and cameras, in addition to software, may increase competition with companies that supply driverless technology to auto manufacturers. Shares of Mobileye NV, which develops systems that model vehicles’ surroundings, fell 4.4% to US$39.86 in New York, their biggest one-day decline since mid-November.\n\n”There is a chance that this development by Google will be considered further progress at a faster rate of change than Mobileye,\" Neil Campling, head of global tech, media and telecom research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, wrote in an e-mail on Monday. “The same could suggest that Google is moving further towards offering end-to-end solutions for the auto OEMs in the AV world and undermining Mobileye’s position.”\n\nCommercial applications\n\nKrafcik, a former Ford executive, described a wide range of commercial applications for the autonomous system. “You can count on Waymo being engaged in a lot of these areas, from logistics, to ride-sharing, to personal use licensing working with OEMs, to last-mile public transport solutions,” he said.\n\nHe declined to give details on the revenue model. Bloomberg News has reported that Waymo plans to start a ride-hailing service later this year, relying on Fiat Chrysler minivans.\n\nIn an earlier interview in Detroit, Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler, stressed that his company is a full-fledged partner with Alphabet, not simply a suppler. “We’re not losing money,” he said of the Waymo arrangement. “But it’s not something that changes our profit targets.”\n\nThe chief of the Italian-American automaker also confirmed an earlier Bloomberg News report that Chrysler will at least double the number of Pacifica minivans it is providing to Waymo.\n\nHonda Mobility\n\nKrafcik declined to offer more details on the Fiat Chrysler partnership. But he did address a possible deal with Honda Motor Co.\n\n”There’s just a really strong philosophical alignment between the two companies,” Krafcik said. “Honda represents Japan and a very aging society where there are a lot of mobility concerns. And a big part of our message has not just been safety but also mobility.”\n\nWaymo, which formed as a new Alphabet business in December, is one of the youngest companies in Detroit for the auto show this week.

While an inferior ROE points towards a relatively inefficient performance, knowing the nuts and bolts of ROE calculation may change that perspective. View our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nBreaking down Return on Equity\n\nROE ratio basically calculates the net income as a percentage of total capital committed by shareholders, namely shareholders’ equity.While an ROE ratio of more than 15% would draw any investor’s attention, historically, established companies in the developed countries have delivered an ROE between 10% and 12%.\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders Equity\n\nNo matter how high or low return a company generates on equity, it should be more than the cost of equity for value creation. For GOOGL, the cost of equity estimate comes at 10.82% based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model using the current risk free rate and a levered beta to account for financial leverage. That compares to Alphabet’s 15% ROE.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we break down ROE using a very popular method called Dupont Formula, it unfolds into three key ratios which are responsible for a company’s profitability: net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage. While higher margin and asset turnover indicate improved efficiency, investors should be cautious about the impact of increased leverage.\n\nDupont Formula ROE = annual net profit ÷ shareholders’ equity ROE = (annual net profit ÷ sales) × (sales ÷ assets) × (assets ÷ shareholders’ equity) ROE = profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverage\n\nA reflection of how net profit margin has affected ROE in the past can be seen in the trend of income and revenue. An investor can gauge a fair estimate of how it’s going to play out in the future by looking at the analysts’ forecasts in the years ahead.While the change in a company’s asset turnover ratio is important in assessing the quality of ROE, an equally important aspect is its comparison to the industry average. Alphabet generated an ROA of 9.4% versus the industry’s 9.19%. For an industry, ROA, which is earnings as a percentage of assets, is a sound representation of asset turnover.\n\nThe last but not the least is the financial leverage. It’s an important ratio as a company can hide its poor operating and asset-use efficiency by increasing leverage. Thus, along with ROE, we should look at the Return on capital, which reflects earnings as a percentage of overall capital employed, including debt. For GOOGL, ROC stood at 16% versus the industry’s 6.78%.\n\nROE – It’s not just another ratio\n\nROE is called the mother of all ratios for a reason. It helps gauge a company’s efficiency both through the income statement and the balance sheet, along with telling you how just changing the capital structure of the company can impact perceived return.

The company started off with the launch of two Snapdragon 8xx processors. This was considered more of a bold approach in comparison to its predecessor given that it was the first time the company was implementing Kryo cores. Almost immediately afterward the company announced the Snapdragon 835. This apparently was not enough for Qualcomm because it has now established a partnership with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google on the Internet of Things.\n\nIt is no secret that the world is revolving around interconnected technology which is pushing manufacturers from an individualistic approach of of standalone gadgets to an era of interconnectivity.\n\nThe partnership seeks to help IoT application developers\n\nThe two tech firms have been collaborating on the creation of exciting new opportunities for developers in mobile, wearables and the IoT. An excited Jeffery Torrance, vice president, business development, Qualcomm Technologies says, “We are pleased to announce our intent to work with Google on this new initiative to expand the Android ecosystem. We anticipate many new and exciting IoT products will result as developers are able to bring the power of the Snapdragon processor together with Android Things.”\n\nApart from this, there is also the optimism that the move will entice more developers to the platform, which is likely to open more avenues, particularly for the Smartphone. They will also interact with familiar connectivity environments the likes of Wi-Fi and support for a wide array of Bluetooth sensors. Nonetheless, there is something for everyone given that the US chip maker is loaded with experience.\n\nAndroid seems to be getting bigger and better as time passes\n\nThere is an anticipation of many other exciting IoT products according to Torrance, once developers are able to bring out the power of the Snapdragon processor. The collaboration should be able to influence a lot of fresh faces for Android Things and the Internet of Things. Apparently, Apple and Samsung are already making significant headway. In the meantime, Google retains the lion’s share of the Smartphone market.

However, the tech giant has seen some progress in cracking the tough language. It has made Japanese one of the languages that can be used in Word Lens.\n\nThe feature, which will be available in the Google Translate app will allow people to interact with an instant translator from their phones. It is particularly useful for travelers hence it will come in handy for the 20 million tourists who visit Japan annually. Apparently, it will not ask for Internet or data connectivity.\n\nOn its blog post, Google wrote, “With Word Lens now available in Japanese, you’ll never have to worry about taking a wrong turn on a busy Shibuya street or ordering something you wouldn’t normally eat.”\n\nThe Word Lens allows instant translation via the camera\n\nAll translations are performed on the mobile device and through the camera, which is able to recognize text overlaid in its live view say by another selected by the user. Initially, the app was only able to translate Japanese to English but on first taking a photograph and highlighting text areas that require translation. Thus this must be a significant milestone for Google, which is being fulfilled two years after the introduction of the feature. Notably, within the two years, it has added no less than 27 languages including Lithuanian, Finnish, and Thai.\n\nBut the feature is meant for brief phrases and words\n\nWord Lens, which was originally its own standalone app before being acquired by Google through its developer Quest Visual will not work well with long sentences or phrases. A long passage of text translation will not have accuracy. Hence the use of brief phrases and words is highly recommended.

(NASDAQ: AMZN ) — if for no other reason than when its AWS cloud servers go down, half the internet seems to go with them. But Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is betting big on the cloud too, and at its Next 2017 event, the company had some big announcements.\n\nSource: Google\n\nGoogle cloud is celebrating some much-needed wins, including new partners, a significant steal for G Suite and recognition for topping cloud providers in 2016 for reliability.\n\nGoogle Cloud Takes Aim at AWS, Azure\n\nThe public cloud is currently dominated by Amazon’s AWS, with over 30% of the market — triple the footprint of second-place Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Azure. Google cloud is in fourth place, trailing International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ).\n\nThe cloud is a huge market already and it’s expected to get far larger, quickly. Forrester recently pegged the expected value of the public cloud — services like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud — to reach $236 billion by 2020.\n\nAnd Google wants a bigger piece of that pie.\n\nAt its Next 2017 conference keynote, the company made the case for choosing Google cloud over AWS or Azure. While noting that it has invested $30 billion in its cloud services, the company rattled off an impressive list of companies that have recently made the move to Google cloud. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY ) and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: CL ) represent the large corporate side of Google cloud’s capabilities, while popular apps like Pokemon Go and Snap Inc.’s (NYSE: SNAP ) Snapchat show off its suitability for hosting consumer apps.\n\nGoogle cloud’s head Diane Greene, took the opportunity to fire a shot at Amazon’s AWS and the bad PR it’s received for large-scale outages. Chances are, you were affected by an AWS issue at the end of February that slowed or took down thousands of websites, apps and services for hours.\n\nGreene noted that Google cloud has been recognized for topping all cloud service providers in availability for 2016. She puts that availability level at 99.999% reliability, which is very impressive.\n\nIt certainly makes a case for switching from AWS.\n\nNext Page", "Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has always been a major force in the data science and machine learning world, and its latest acquisition will only solidify its strong positioning even further.\n\nThe company will reportedly acquire Kaggle, a data science and machine learning competition specialist. Kaggle absolutely dominates its specific niche of providing a platform for companies and individuals to compete against each other for real money.\n\nTechCrunch has details on the move, which hasn’t yet been made official:\n\nSources tell us that Google is acquiring Kaggle, a platform that hosts data science and machine learning competitions. Details about the transaction remain somewhat vague, but given that Google is hosting its Cloud Next conference in San Francisco this week, the official announcement could come as early as tomorrow.\n\nKaggle, which was founded in 2010 by Anthony Goldbloom and Ben Hamner, boasts over 500,000 data scientists on its platform. Google and Kaggle have already worked together in the past, and are currently teaming up on a $100,000 competition to accurately classify YouTube videos.\n\nIn all likelihood, Google values Kaggle for its deep user base, rather than any proprietary technology, which is a bit of a departure from its usual penchant for cutting edge intellectual property.\n\nSince the deal still hasn’t officially been announced, financial details of the transaction aren’t yet known. Kaggle has raised about $12.5 million in several rounds of financing since its establishment nearly seven years ago.\n\nAlphabet Inc shares were trading at $854.97 per share on Wednesday morning, up $3.82 (+0.45%). Year-to-date, GOOGL has gained 7.89%, versus a 6.25% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.\n\nGOOGL currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 43 stocks in the Internet category.", "Pacific Crest continues to recommend buying Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Attendance at day one of Google Cloud Next '17 significantly exceeded the firm’s expectations, suggesting much greater interest in the platform. Google focused on its increased sales and support capabilities, a growing partner ecosystem, and data analytics and machine learning as competitive differentiators. These, along with the tremendous interest level, increase the firm’s confidence that Google can continue growing its cloud business and build it into a meaningful revenue and profit contributor over time.\n\nDespite a larger venue than last year, crowds at Cloud Next 2017 were crushing on day one, with massive lines to get into the event and very long overflow lines to get into popular breakout sessions, particularly those around machine learning. Although it is difficult to separate growth in overall interest in cloud computing from interest in GCP specifically, the large crowds suggests a significant increase in interest around GCP in the past 12 months.\n\nA key message of the keynote was Google's expanded sales/support capabilities and desire to work with channel partners to help serve enterprise customers. This seems to be generating solid early results, as Google had success stories with several large enterprises across a variety of workloads, including: Home Depot, Colgate Palmolive, Disney and eBay. Per Pacific Crest’s proprietary discussions with GCP partners and industry contacts, Google’s strategic choice to pursue a more hybrid cloud message versus AWS is attracting more channel support.\n\nGoogle continued to focus on its expertise in machine learning and data analytics as competitive advantages versus other cloud platforms. While the message was not new, the response was much more positive than the firm expected. Machine-learning–based tools seemed to get the most positive responses in the keynote and machine learning sessions were significantly over-subscribed; the initial machine learning breakout appeared to have more than 100 people in an overflow line, hoping to get in if registered attendees did not show. If artificial intelligence and machine learning prove to have as applications as broad as Pacific Crest believes they could, Google's branding and capabilities around this could allow it to leapfrog competitors for important workloads.\n\nWhile the firm’s core investment thesis remains most closely tied to the profit potential of the core search and YouTube businesses, the presentations today increased its confidence that GCP could develop into a meaningful revenue and profit driver in the coming years. If this happens, it would likely represent upside to the firm’s current estimates, which could drive GOOGL beyond its $1,040 price target.\n\nPacific Crest’s price target of $1,040 is based on 16x EV/EBITDA, using its 2017 Google EBITDA estimate of $38.9 billion, which implicitly assigns zero net value for \"Other Bets.\" Market and macroeconomic conditions could interfere with the realization of this price target, as could risks such as entering new markets, the global macroeconomy, increasing competition outside of search, industry changes brought about by the shift to mobile and the difficulty of managing high growth based on its non-core investments.\n\nThe companies mentioned in this article are subjects of research reports issued recently by investment firms.

Users will be able to connect their cars to smartphones, unlock or locate their vehicle and monitor their speeds with Alexa.\n\nThe Amazon product will also inform users if the airbags are about to deploy, it will add destinations to the car's navigation systems, check their fuel levels, lock or unlock their vehicle from home and more.\n\nAMZN stock is up more than 6% in the young year.\n\nAlphabet Inc (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet vehicles will be hitting the road, and soon .\n\nChrysler Pacificas with Google's self-driving technology will be unleashed onto public roads in late January, the tech giant announced over the weekend at the North American International Auto Show.\n\nWaymo - the Google self-driving project - is producing the technology for the Alphabet product.

Although the company generated $17.1B in operating income and $64.2B in revenue through the first nine months of its current fiscal year, the stock only managed to deliver a return of 4.35%, compared to the NASDAQ's 9.79%. That's nowhere near the kind of returns the stock has generated in the past.

Can Amazon.com, Inc. really dent Alphabet Inc?\n\nGoogle Losing Out To Amazon In E-Commerce Search\n\nAccording to a report by BusinessInsider , Amazon is slowly taking a sizeable chunk of Google's search business by becoming the go-to place for e-commerce search. As per the report, \"more than half of people start their search for online shopping on Amazon now, while only 26% use search engines like Google as the starting point\". Google is a search company, which makes more money when a larger number of people use its search engine. Now by losing market share in e-commerce search, Google is taking a hit on its revenue, as it is primarily dependent on search-advertising to generate revenue. The report gives more details about the trend, but what is more worrying for Google is that its e-commerce search-share has halved in last two years, whereas Amazon has gained drastically in the same period ( see image below). This is a serious concern for Google, and it appears as if things are not going to get any better in future.

This post describes how delightful Alexa is, and how Echo combined with Alexa is designed to make it easier for you to give more of your money to Amazon. At CES 2017 companies like Ford (NYSE:F), Huawei, LG, as well as a number of startups, all unveiled home appliances, phones, cars, and more gadgets with Alexa integration. Alexa even made an unexpected appearance on Google’s Android ecosystem. Chinese smartphone manufacturer Huawei announced that its flagship handset running on Alphabet Inc's Android operating system will come with an app that gives users access to Alexa in the United States.\n\nAmazon Echo has an early lead and plenty of buzz to go with it. The problem here is not that Amazon Echo is the smart speaker to beat for Google Home. There's more to this. There is a belief in the technology industry that such voice-powered digital assistants will replace keyboards and touch-screens as the primary way consumers interact with devices. In the report stated above, analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research considers that this shift is still in its initial stages, and that Google must move swiftly to make its presence felt in this space, to maintain its dominance in internet search, particularly on Android devices. Quoting him from the above report:\n\n“To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google’s voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that’s a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue”.\n\nAlso Read: Amazon.com, Inc Wins Big, But AMZN Stock Is Facing Strong Resistance\n\nThe thing is that the bad part doesn't end here for Google. The more Alexa devices that Amazon and its partners sell, the better Amazon does at its core retail business. It is believed that every Echo owner is a customer who is more likely to spend more on books, groceries, music, and movies on Amazon. But that is not the case with Google. Google can sell as many Google Home devices as it wants, but at the end of the day, Google is a search advertising company, not a retail company, and those Google Home devices aren't delivering ads. We all know Google is better at search than Amazon by a huge margin, and the company can still do a lot more with the data gathered on Home devices. The point is that consumers will be spending less time in front of screens and looking at Google's search ads. No matter how good Google's search ads are, it doesn't matter if people aren't seeing them.\n\nConsidering the first point stated in the article too, things are not looking any better for Google, going by the direction things are heading in, in computing space. It seems that Google's vulnerability is becoming Amazon's strength. Alexa's swift rise is making life difficult for Google.\n\nIn Summary\n\nPutting all the above factors together it is evident Amazon is gaining in Google's territory. Analysts believe Google's decision to debut its voice assistant exclusively on its own hardware might not have gone well with manufacturers. Given Google's plans to scale it across all other devices, the company needs to rethink its strategy. Sergei Burkov, CEO of Alterra.ai, an artificial intelligence company said \" Huge part of an assistant is search. Google is a search company. Amazon is not.” All is not lost for Google, yet, given the strength of its internet search technology, it can certainly catch up with the leader Amazon here. However, a growth investor would be tempted to invest in AMZN stock rather than GOOGL stock in 2017, since Amazon has many things going its way, where as Google has mainly its double-digit revenue growth to boast of. It is also to be noted that Google's Other Bet's have largely shown disappointing results until now which is not the case with Amazon.\n\nLooking for great tech stocks? Check out our top stock picks, which have beaten the NASDAQ by over 109%.", "By all accounts Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) had a fabulous Consumer Electronics Show. According to InvestorPlace contributor Brad Moon, Alexa was the big winner of CES 2017 — an event the company didn’t even have its own booth at. The company’s Alexa voice assistant could eventually become an operating system, showing up last week in refrigerators, cars and robots. But what kind of affect does this have on AMZN stock?\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmazon’s ability to get its assistant supported by hardware contrasted with the failures of Siri from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Cortana from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and Google Assistant from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ).\n\nAmazon did it, first, by delivering the assistant to millions through its Echo speakers and, second, by allowing it to run on the cheapest imaginable hardware, focusing instead on the cloud-based Alexa Voice Service API. Rivals sought to use their voice assistants to tie hardware to their higher-end ecosystems, and they are unlikely to show much for consumer markets before next year.\n\nAMZN stock had fallen from a high of nearly $850 per share in October to a post-election low of barely $720. To many investors that is starting to look like yet-another missed opportunity to get in.\n\nSpectacular Whispers\n\nThe “whisper number” on Amazon’s Christmas-season earnings have become outrageous. The latest is for earnings of $1.43 per share on revenues of $44.70 billion. Last Christmas, by contrast, Amazon did $1.00 per share of earnings on revenues of $35.747 billion and, after another one of those discouraging falls (this time to near $500), rose steadily to that near-$850 high.\n\nIf AMZN stock matches expectations, you’re talking about top-line growth of 25% and earnings growth of 43%, year-over-year. You’re still talking about paying nearly three times sale for a retailer, when successful merchants like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT ) get just 40 cents of equity for each dollar of sales, but Amazon is no longer a retailer.\n\nSince then, of course, AMZN has become a major TV studio, with the Golden Globes to prove it. In addition to its $100 per year Prime shipping plan, which includes the video offerings and ties customers to the shopping service with free shipping, Amazon has added $10-per-month plans for music and eBooks — I’ve lately found the Kindle Unlimited offering to be outstanding.\n\nIts Amazon Web Services cloud is practically an industry standard, and its most recent report showed it growing 55% per year, to a run rate of over $11 billion, with high profitability. If Alexa is becoming an operating system, akin to Windows, Android and Apple’s iOS, many will consider it highly undervalued.\n\nThe Bear Case for AMZN Stock\n\nEvery story like this must include a bear case for the stock.\n\nBack in 2012, when I first started accumulating shares at about $330 each, bears claimed that Amazon didn’t make any money, that it was a “Ponzi scheme” and, essentially, an over-priced merchandiser.\n\nJust last week, InvestorPlace contributor Chris Tyler wrote that the technicals were bad, that the data collected by the Echo may become subject to judicial review and that the incoming Administration doesn’t like the company.\n\nScams are proliferating on the service and one long-time Amazon bull, Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities, told his followers to dump AMZN stock late last year, saying cloud growth catalysts are gone.\n\nNext Page" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1627777777777778, 0.1987462006079028, 0.1281770833333334 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4679365079365079, 0.5183763931104358, 0.4472569444444445 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-01-09T14:39:30.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-09T05:15:08.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-10T15:37:51.000+0000" } ] }

Now I’ll dive into what I think the risks of GOOGL stock are, and how they may manifest.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMy biggest concern with GOOGL stock has always been that it is effectively a one-trick pony. Alphabet is the largest digital advertising billboard in the world, with about 88% of its revenues coming from advertising. Moreover, GOOGL stock’s growth has been driven by this spectacular seizure of internet territory from competitors.\n\nIn fact, during the financial crisis, ad revenues still grew about 8% year-over-year in 2009 despite a worldwide ad revenue decline of 11% that year.\n\nGOOGL Stock and Digital Advertising\n\nNow, digital advertising was still in its hyper-growth phase back then. Should another major crisis hit, I’m not so sure that Alphabet won’t see a decline. Yet what’s so astonishing about GOOGL stock is just how much money it makes from advertising. It could get hit with a 20% decline in total revenues, which would bring it roughly in line with fiscal year 2015 results, and still generate net income of $15 billion or so, and operating cash flow of $26 billion or so.\n\nThis is hardly a catastrophe, which shows that for now at least, GOOGL has a lock on substantial growth in ad revenue. However, that advertising is the result of people using Google’s search engine. What if that changes? Right now, Google has more than 80% search engine market share. It’s so popular that we now use the product’s name as a verb.\n\nI think it will be very difficult to supplant Google as far as search engine usage goes. However, there is other behavior which may result in less reliance on the search engine and, therefore, fewer eyeballs for ads. Mobile apps have obviously exploded in number and usage. The more adept and fully functional that apps become, the less Google may be used.\n\nSocial media is only going to grow, and the more that these products offer in terms of either their own search engines, or places for advertisers to divide their ad spend, the worse it is for GOOGL.\n\nNext Page", "Alphabet Inc.

The department in its lawsuit is seeking to compel the tech giant to hand over compensation data as part of a compliance evaluation.\n\nGoogle’s Privacy Concerns\n\nIn the lawsuit, the Department accuses the search giant of failing to hand over requested data and documents pertaining to compensation as requested by the office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. The agency had sought data regarding the company’s equal opportunity program as early as September 2015.\n\n“Despite many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily, Google has refused to do so. We filed this lawsuit so we can obtain the information we need to complete our evaluation,” said OFCCP Acting Director Thomas M. Dowd.\n\nGoogle in its defense insists it has turned down over hundreds of thousands of documents to the department as part of its commitment to people’s privacy. The tech giant goes on to claim that handing over some of the documents requested by the agency will reveal confidential data, something it is not willing to do.\n\nDiversity Concerns\n\nGoogle, one of the biggest Federal contractors, is required by law to permit the federal government to inspect and copy records of its compliance with equal opportunity. The law prohibits such contractors from discriminating in hiring based on applicant’s race, color, religion, sex, or sexual orientation. Why Google would discriminate by anything other than talent and productivity is an open question.\n\nThe tech giant handing over the required documents is expected to shed more light on its hiring practices as well as the composition of its workforce, though it is unclear how the composition of its workforce would constitute evidence of discrimination based on anything other than talent and productivity.\n\nJust like other tech companies where men occupy a good number of high-ranking position, Google continues to grapple with diversity concerns, something that the labor department wants to crack down on, as they hold that if the numbers are not exactly equal in proportion to population, discrimination based on something other than productivity must be taking place. The same is part of an effort that seeks to enforce equal employment opportunities regardless of one’s race, gender, or sexual orientation. It is unclear how this effort helps either those supposedly discriminated against, or Google.\n\nGoogle stock was unchanged in Wednesday trading session having shed $0.24 to close the session at $807.77 a share.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "Legal hassles continue for Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL Google as it faces a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Labor.

(GOOG) Stock Technicals Favorable?" ], "article_text" : [ "With all other things going on, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been on a run — rising 3.93 percent in just three months. It looks like traders are happy with the stock. On the other side, analysts now consider Alphabet Inc. a buy, and a technical analysis of the stock is setting somewhat neutral outlook for now.\n\nLet’s talk about the gap between analyst price targets for the next 12 months and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)‘s current share price. Normally this spread should be in positive territory, indicating that analysts expect an investment’s value to increase over time. So is with Alphabet Inc.. The median target of analyst views collected by Yahoo Finance was as much as $184.58 below GOOG’s recent stock price. That’s the optimistic view from Wall Street.\n\nThe stock has actually made strong gains in the past year, as the company has gathered a 10.22% return in the past twelve months. But even with this move, there is still plenty of room for the company to come back from a longer term perspective, and especially if we look to recent lows for the company as well.\n\nThe company’s share price is down -3.97% from previous highs of around $853.5 per share on March 21, 2017. On the bright side, the company’s share price has been on the rebound, up more than 51.6% since hitting lows of $663.28 on June 27, 2016.\n\nFinally, from a technical perspective, there’s a strong possibility that the stock could enter into a new bull market after finding strong support between $808.35 and $814.64. In terms of pullbacks, $826.6 level is the first resistance point. Technical analysis can help recognize key technical price levels in the stock. Investors can use these support and resistance levels to refine their entries and exits from stocks.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) price is pointing towards neither exit nor entry barriers, according to a technical analysis tool called the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Last session Alphabet Inc. RSI was seen at 41.07. RSI measures the speed and change of a stock price to warn investors when a stock’s momentum has carried it too far. An RSI reading above 80 indicates that a stock is overbought while anything below 20 is oversold.\n\nWith these kinds of figures it is worthy to note that Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has been put into a buy territory, but there are few other spots to consider. The Stochastic %K for GOOG is 26.54. Stochastics is a momentum indicator that uses basic support and resistance levels and integrates with the trend to give accurate buy or sell signals to traders. For stochastics, readings below 20 are considered oversold and you would only take buy signals if the indicator is below that level. A value of 80 is considered overbought and sell signals occurring below that level would be ignored. This leads to longer trades and should result in fewer losses.”)\n\n14-day Williams %R for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) moved to around 64.99. The interpretation of Williams %R is very similar to that of the stochastic oscillator, except that the stochastic oscillator has internal smoothing. The oscillator ranges from 0 to -100. No matter how fast a security advances or declines, Williams %R will always fluctuate within this range. Overbought and oversold levels can be used to identify unsustainable price extremes. Simply put, readings in the range of 80% to 100% indicate that the security is oversold while readings in the 0% to 20% range suggest it is overbought." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.08666105499438832 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4170229276895943 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-29T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

I've played the game and while it's fun putting a target on the DOW (NYSEARCA:DIA) or S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), most will prove wrong when we ring in 2018.\n\nIn the days and weeks ahead you're going to hear bullish predictions that seem out of touch with reality to perma-bears predicting a massive correction or bear market. If you keep saying the same thing over and over again, eventually you'll be right.\n\nLet me put that on the back burner for the moment and focus on what professionals are really talking about.\n\nWill it be Macro or Micro events that drive the bulk of 2017 returns?\n\nThe above is a conversation taking place at financial institutions around the world. Will it be a geopolitical event or a series of them that drive markets from Risk On to Risk Off and back again? Or, will we finally get back to traditional money management focused on fundamental returns and economic outcomes?\n\nPost the financial crisis, investor performance was largely driven by central bank policy both here and abroad. Fixed income and stocks were in strong bull markets with central bank policies around the world supporting both.\n\nPay no attention to the man (or woman) behind the curtain\n\n\n\n\n\nSure, we had the occasional geopolitical setback with a terrorist attack or currency crisis causing the hiccup. But in the end, it was central bank policy that ruled the day. Post the crisis Bernanke, Yellen, Draghi and Kuroda all took turns playing the Wizard or man behind the curtain. The only thing that mattered was if central banks were accommodative and how much.\n\nLast week's meeting confirmed what we already knew. The Fed, after a long delay has changed course raising the Fed Funds rate for the second time in a decade. We'll have to wait and see if the captain's order came in time but I suspect that the long overdue process of monetary policy handing the baton to fiscal policy has begun.\n\nOf course, the process has started but is no guarantee that fiscal proposals actually become working policy in the months and years ahead.\n\nI'm very encouraged many of the economic proposals discussed by the incoming administration will help drive GDP. However, I've been in this job long enough to understand that there is a huge economic divide between rhetoric and policy. Political compromise has been with us since the dawn of the Republic and I suspect will be a driving force in the years ahead.\n\nInflection Point\n\n2016 may prove to be an inflection point for markets and maybe for management styles as well. It's pretty clear this was the year that Growth (NYSEARCA:IVW) finally gave up the thrown to Value (NYSEARCA:IVE). For the last several years investors have been crowded into a handful of stocks still exhibiting secular growth and willing to pay almost anything for the privilege. While I believe most of the FANG stocks Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will perform well, I doubt it will be to the exclusion of all others.\n\nWhile much has been made of the fact that Value has trounced Growth since Election Day, the peak for this trade really took place at the end of last year.\n\nAnother changing dynamic was the rise in rates along with Financials (NYSEARCA:XLF) coming months before the election beginning just after BREXIT in June. The great rotation has likely begun with bond bears like Jeff Gundlach taking a victory lap.\n\nEven with the obvious headwinds for fixed income there are titanic forces in place to prevent a complete collapse of U.S. bonds. On a relative basis, they may not be attractive especially against stocks with dividends close to ten year rates but when compared to international sovereign counterparts, they look like a home run.\n\nConsumer Staples Still at Risk?\n\nThe rotation that should continue is out of Consumer Staples (NYSEARCA:XLP) with dividends only somewhat higher than the index while offering little or no organic growth. Coca Cola (NYSE:KO), and many of the food companies fall into that basket. Short of potential M&A activity I find it difficult to make a case for the sector. Shorts, may have as tough time as longs with bankers focused on combining slow growth companies looking for synergies to reduce costs and increase shareholder return. (Expect more mergers in this sector)\n\nWhile central bank policy may slowly be moving to the sidelines investors still have the inevitable geopolitical challenges to endure. Most will prove transitory creating opportunity but some will force us to change course.\n\nMy Prediction\n\nI'm going to approach the challenge this way. Like any pilot, I look at weather reports before stepping into the plane knowing full well that any forecast is no guarantee of clear skies. I may be forced to change course even altering my destination.\n\nHere's my prediction. I'm going to work as hard as I can, as long as I can to get the best investment outcome for investors. I know full well that some of these decisions will be right and some will be wrong.\n\nThere's only one thing worse than being wrong, \"It's Staying Wrong!\"\n\nHappy Holidays everyone.\n\n*At the time of this article funds managed by David Nelson were long $GOOGL, $FB & $SPY\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are long SPY, FB, GOOGL.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

The fundamental valuation principles and investment thesis still apply in the same way as Class A stock.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a long opportunity capable of generating high shareholder returns over the next 12 to 18 months as well as for the long term. The company's stock is currently trading at a slightly lower price relative to its own historic level and compared to its peers, priced at LTM P/E of 29.3x versus 10-year median of 31.3x for GOOG and current median of 49x for its peers (see the full list in the later section). Although the valuations for these information technology (IT) firms are overpriced in comparison to 17.07x LTM P/E for S&P 500 IT sector index, the market is not realizing its potential growth opportunities in the coming years, as reflected in GOOG's current price level. GOOG's competitive moat and fundamental value proposition remain intact, and the stock is very susceptible to significant increase in price via catalysts such as the next earnings call.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nEver since Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded the company, GOOG was able to grow at an exponential rate due to two primary factors: the management capability and open-source platform of the business. At the center of all innovations that took place within GOOG lies the key leaders who took an unconventional approach to developing the business. For instance, GOOG's search engine became the world's best by pursuing one of its ten commandments \"focus on the user and all else will follow.\" Page and Brin followed this principle by rejecting offers from its competitors from displaying ads on its main search page because doing so would distract users from searching what they were looking for. They also decided to make its main page a blank white background with only the search box in the middle in order to increase the efficiency in which users would be immediately be directed out of the search page and be led to the page they were looking for. The strong focus on improving the user experience by the management is what resulted in value creation.\n\nIn conjunction with the management's extraordinary ability to innovate, GOOG was able to expand its user base at an astonishing rate due to the open-source platform (free-of-cost services/products), which created network effect (as the number of users increases, the value of individual interaction with the search engine increases). The effect is due to the search algorithm where user's input is used to generate results. Since the outcome is a function of user input, the relevancy and accuracy of the results page will only improve as more users are involved in the process. The open-source platform allows the network effect to be prevalent in every aspect of the business, including Gmail, Google Maps and Google Chrome. The firm is able to gather tremendous amounts of data about its users while increasing its user base at the same time, creating numerous monetization opportunities such as advertising.\n\nGOOG's business segments are broken down to two parts: Google and Other Bets. Under Google lies profitable divisions such as YouTube while Other Bets has long-term so-called moonshot ventures that include driverless cars and artificial intelligence. This portfolio structure makes GOOG a very attractive investment in both short- and long-term horizons because not only the ad sales at its primary business is growing at an impressive pace of 21% YoY despite its Q3 revenue size of $21.5B but also its Other Bets segment is setting up the stage for future disruption as well. Thus, GOOG poses opportunity for profits in both near and future years.\n\nWhat Happened\n\nGOOG has underperformed the S&P 500 during 2016 (6.3% return vs. 11.1%, respectively). Although its stock appreciated, the momentum was subdued. The story over the past two years since its restructuring has been weaker than expected results for Q1 earnings 2016. It posted $7.5/share on $20.26B in revenue versus analyst estimates of $7.97/share and $20.37B in revenue, polled by Thomson Reuters. This was partially due to lower cost per click. The transition into mobile screens from PCs resulted in decreasing cost per click.\n\nMore than expected capital expenditures on the firm's Other Bets segment also caused a recent selloff in the stock as investors became cautious about the moonshot projects that are generating large losses. The capex for the \"Other Bets\" division amounted to $280M in Q3, about a 50% increase from the previous quarter, most of which came from the Google Fiber project. However, GOOG is going through initiatives to scale back some of these projects, which will be discussed in the later section.\n\nThe estimates for Traffic-Acquisition-Costs (TAC) has been growing as well. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat explained the narrowing margins were the result of higher TAC. For Q3, the street estimate for TAC was $4B before the Q3 release and the actual amount was $4.2B.\n\nThe recent macroeconomic events have also played their part in suppressing the valuation such as Trump's remarks on increased oversight on the tech firms' activities in terms of job creation and EU antitrust lawsuits.\n\nThese factors together have limited the company's market price in recent years as well as EPS growth outlook for short-term and long-term forecasts. GOOG is currently trading at 29.3x LTM PE vs a 20-year median of 31.3x, and 1.54x multiple of S&P 500's LTM P/E vs. a 20-year median of 1.83. Based on both historical standards and the S&P 500 valuation, GOOG is seen as a growth stock that is trading at a fair price with more than 54% upside potential.\n\nCatalysts\n\nThe following catalysts will boost the company's price to its intrinsic value, well above the current valuation. In a worst case scenario, the company at its current price level is fairly valued, resulting in a wide margin of safety and minimal downside risk. Based on the company's diversified portfolio of investments in different areas of technology, its current valuation reflects the overblown fears by investors in response to recent events that do not have meaningful impact on the firm's fundamental business model.\n\n1) Q4 Earnings Exceeding Expectations Through Hardware Business\n\nThe current market price does not reflect better-than-expected hardware sales during Q4. Google released its first ever smartphone designed by the firm during Q4 and the product was well received by the consumers. During Q4, Alphabet sold 552k Pixel phones at $700 a unit for revenue of $386M, which could add about $1.8B sales for 2017E, according to research by Goldman Sachs. Furthermore, Google Home sales are another contributing factor to the optimistic outlook for Q4 earnings results, selling more than 500k devices at around $129 each for a predicted revenue of $65M. Although the estimated margins on these devices are tighter due to the capital expenditure required to initially drive the manufacturing and distribution processes, the profits from hardware sales will flow to the bottom line as Google realizes economies of scale with larger production volume.\n\nThe introduction of new products will not only drive the price upwards for Q4 but also create a stronger ecosystem as well as network effect as mentioned earlier in the report. Thus far, Google has been focusing on providing an open platform for its users in hopes to enhance the user experience. The free-of-charge applications such as Gmail, Google Maps and YouTube allowed the company to exponentially increase its user base and collect as much user information as possible. Now with more than 1 billion monthly users across its open platform services, Google has enough data about its users such as their search patterns, popular destinations and contact lists within their Gmail or Google accounts. The company can deliver ever more efficient services as it integrates these collected data into Pixel and Google Home. For instance, as the smartphone keeps track of the user's location, it can send the information to Google Home beforehand so that it will know when to start boiling a cup of hot tea. Similarly, as more consumers utilize these products, the accuracy of applications such as Google Maps and Google Search will only get better, strengthening the network effect.\n\nAside from hardware business, Google Play and Google Cloud Platform offerings will also contribute to earnings as they gain material cloud share from AMZN's AWS.\n\n2) Monetization Efforts along With Continued User Base Growth\n\nThe key investment thesis in Alphabet is that the company has numerous monetization opportunities under its umbrella of businesses. First, it could be making more money off of YouTube by charging for service through a subscription-based model or loading it up with ads. Rather than trying to monetize its viewership to its fullest extent right now, Alphabet is allowing it to grow (currently monthly viwers exceed 1B users). Some say if its viewership was to be monetized, YouTube could be worth as much as $300/share and right now investors are paying almost nothing for it. Recently, Google rolled out a paid subscription service called YouTube Red, which allows consumers to pay for ad-free peace when watching YouTube videos. This is a step for Google towards monetizing YouTube, potentially having significant accretive impact on its earnings.\n\nGoogle's second monetization opportunity is its Google Maps. The company began to place relevant ads on Google Maps both within its search results list and on the map with a purple icon. It is aimed at increasing visibility of businesses at \"micro-moment\" with passive in-map suggestions of relevant stores, local inventory search, or in-store promotions. Just like YouTube, Google Maps also has a tremendous user base with high-precision accuracy of location search. The quality of service will not be compromised by advertisements because the application has already created a lasting network effect. Likewise, the relevancy of the ad will only improve as the user base grows. The app presents a solid foundation for a cash-generating machine in the near-term future.\n\nLastly, the firm's core search business is expanding its breadth of advertising platform. It is now applying Expanded Text Ads and Individual Bid Adjustments in its search advertising business in order to maximize profits from the service. Due to tremendous amount of paid-clicks on these advertisements, Google will be able to take a sizeable proceeds from these expanded ad efforts.\n\nThe monetization gap will get narrower as the gap between the total time spent on media and U.S. mobile's share of overall ad budgets continue to tighten. In 2015, U.S. consumers spent 24.0% of media time on mobile, according to eMarketer, compared to mobile's 12.6% share of total U.S. media ad budget spent, according to Magna Global. In 2016, consumers spent 25.7% of their total media time on mobile devices while mobile's share of allocated ad budgets was 18.2%. The trends in increasing time spent on mobile devices as well as higher allocation of media budget on mobile illustrate the market for media ad on mobile platform is getting bigger. For CY16, the online advertising market is on track to increase by $26bn. This creates even greater monetization prospects for Alphabet.\n\n3) Undervalued Market Price and Solid Financial Position\n\nAlphabet is trading at a bargain at current market price. It has a net cash balance of about $120 per share which is not reflected in its P/E multiple. It also has the venture-capital arm that has yielded losses in the past 12 months, driving down the reported net income by about $4/share. With a P/E multiple of 28x, you are paying a negative $100 for venture-capital division, which includes the moonshot ventures such as driverless cars and artificial intelligence.\n\nSo take $800 per share market price, deduct the value for YouTube and the cash balance, and then add the venture-cap losses back to the reported earnings. Adjusting for these three factors, you are paying a very cheap price for just the Google division.\n\nThe earnings estimates reflected in the market price are also relatively conservative. The current consensus EPS for the fourth quarter is $9.64/share and sales estimate of $20.5B (Net of TAC). The estimates are based on conservative assumptions, 11.5% QoQ growth rate for Google Websites ad revenue versus 14.1% growth last year in the same quarter. The consensus also assumes higher TAC to Google Network Members, 70.4% compared to 70.1% last quarter. Assuming higher SG&A expenses related to Pixel and Google Home marketing efforts as mentioned by management during Q3 earnings call, the gross margin is assumed to be 61.7% and operating margin of 25.6% for Q4. The estimated margins are lower than the previous quarters which have averaged about 63% and 26.5%, respectively.\n\nAlong with the underappreciated stock value, Alphabet has an extremely healthy balance sheet that is able to not only support growth in hardware sales through infrastructure spending but also drive shareholder-friendly capital allocation policies. With a cash balance of $83B and total debt of $4B, the company is able to put its cash to work through a series of acquisitions, a share repurchase or a special dividend, all of which would benefit shareholders in the long term.\n\nIn addition to the strong cash balance, GOOG is most likely to sell part of its moonshot ventures and receive proceeds in additional cash. GOOG announced on 1/13/17 that it is shutting down the drone project known as Project Titan as well as the Google Fiber project, which attempts to deliver high-speed internet via fiber-optic cables. It is also selling its satellite business to a startup called Planet Labs Inc. These sell-offs will limit the losses created by the divisions and free up some capital to pursue other more optimistic moonshot initiatives like Project Loon, Project Wing, AI, and self-driving technology. I believe such a move is an efficient allocation of capital into investments that have better prospects of coming through, just as GE did with its numerous subsidiaries. The disciplinary actions relating to capital allocation seem very appropriate for GOOG's balance sheet and will add value to the firm in the long term.\n\nValuation\n\nAs mentioned previously, GOOG has been trading at a relatively cheap valuation compared to its peers like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).\n\nThe below table uses NTM valuations since the market is pricing GOOG based on its future earnings and what the investors are expecting in the coming months. Both NTM P/sales and NTM P/E for GOOG are on the lower end of the valuation spectrum relative to the universe of tech firms.\n\nHowever, GOOG is an unconventional company that is constantly introducing disruptive technologies. Thus, some would argue that it is inappropriate to compare its valuation to competitors but rather look at the company on its own.\n\nBelow is a breakdown on GOOG valuation based on three different scenarios over the next few years:\n\nBear Case\n\n2017E Net Income: $22.7B\n\nP/E: 23.3x\n\nMarket Cap: $528.9B\n\nShares Outstanding: 690M\n\nStock Price (Upside/Downside): $766.54 (-4.2%)\n\nThis scenario assumes GOOG's earnings will fall short relative to the consensus estimate ($23.0B). I assumed higher SG&A expenses than expected related to the Pixel and Google Home marketing costs and growing competition from Facebook over digital ads that may lead to slower growth in Google ad revenue. I also assumed P/E multiple much below the current LTM 29.3x.\n\nBase Case\n\n2017E Net Income: $23.9B\n\nP/E: 28.3x\n\nMarket Cap: $676.37B\n\nShares Outstanding: 690M\n\nStock Price (Upside/Downside): $980.25 (22.5%)\n\nThis assumes a conservative case where GOOG net income will exceed expectations while its P/E increasing to a higher multiple toward the median trading P/E of its peers at the current market level. As investors realize the growth potential through YouTube, monetization opportunities in Google Maps and hardware sales, the P/E will increase significantly.\n\nBull Case\n\n2017E Net income: $24.6B\n\nP/E: 33.7x\n\nMarket Cap: $829.0B\n\nShares Outstanding: 690M\n\nStock Price/Upside: $1,201.48 (50.2%)\n\nThis case assumes GOOG to continue building on its core search business while getting more efficient in TAC and SG&A expenses. Other growth prospects come from YouTube subscription based business and increasing investments into Cloud. Numerous investments allow ample room for opportunities to capture market share in different industries. P/E of 33.4x is appropriate considering the growth potential, huge piles of cash and the negative valuation put on its Other Bets division.\n\nBased on its 2017E net income, the return on invested capital (ROIC), the returns from the capital put into future working capital, PP&E, goodwill, and other intangible assets, would improve in comparison to its three-year historical average of 28.9%.\n\nRisks\n\nWhat could go wrong:\n\n1) As media time is spent more on mobile rather than desktops, revenue from ads may decelerate due to the nature of smaller displays.\n\n2) The monetization on next major revenue drivers - cloud, hardware, and Maps - may not materialize\n\n3) EU antitrust lawsuits posing greater regulatory risk around Android, Adsense and Shopping. This increases potential for more scrutiny over GOOG's operations in Europe.\n\nConclusion\n\nI believe that the market is offering investors a very attractive opportunity to allocate their capital in GOOG at a cheap multiple. As Warren Buffett once quoted, \"it's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\" GOOG is not only a wonderful company but also trades at an attractive price point. The company will be able to expand its loyal base of users and generate total shareholder returns of 11.5% over the short term. At 25-27x 2017E P/E multiple, GOOG's intrinsic price would be trading at around $833.16-897.47, about 10% above the current levels. Most of the risks surrounding the company have disappeared post shut downs on capex-heavy projects like Project Titan and the firm continues to increase its earnings despite growing competition.\n\nA few remarks on GOOG. Google is now at a turning point where it could turn into even larger cash generating machine as it starts to monetize on its array of businesses. I believe these initiatives are most likely driven by earnings-conscious CFO, Ruth Porat, who joined the firm in 2015. I see her role within the company as the next cash flow booster in the firm's growth stages. She is making efforts to cut costs and generate cash flows in wherever possible, thus transitioning the company from a somewhat experimental, premature organization into a cost-efficient, free cash flow generating holdings company. That is not to say that the firm is compromising any of its business qualities or innovations taking place within its umbrella. Sergey Brin, Larry Page and Eric Schmidt continue to have the majority of the voting rights and they will constantly push towards establishing disruptive technologies in order to put Alphabet at the forefront of innovation. Thus, addition of Ruth Porat as CEO and other impactful leaders to the management are positive factors of growth in the long term.\n\nI view investing in GOOG as a long-term commitment and it is also a bet on its management. There will inevitably be a few bumps along the way but a major part of my investment thesis is the management's capability to handle those tough situations. Historically, the leaders at GOOG have proved their core values through the \"Ten commandments.\" They decided not to expand their business in China, for instance, in order to stick to those principles. I view this characteristic of the management as a key factor in pushing the firm towards retaining its fundamental value proposition.\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are long GOOG.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

This very ability of GOOGL stock to recover so quickly speaks to underlying demand and a multimonth uptrend that active investors and traders must respect until proven otherwise.\n\nWhen I last discussed Alphabet stock on Jan. 9, I said that shares appeared to have good upside potential into late January.

The study was conducted by SocialBlade, a tracker of social statistics, with Kotaku commissioning it.\n\nAmong the highlights of the study was the fact that at the beginning of the year in January, the top 50 channels had average daily views of 4.1 million. This, however, dropped to a little over 3.7 million views ten months later. The decline in viewership mostly happened in the second half of 2016. Channels belonging to major media organizations such as TV networks and record labels were excluded and the study only concentrated on channels led by personalities such as PewDiePie and Jacksepticeye.\n\nCause unknown\n\nThe results of the study have ignited debate on whether the decline in viewership is a result of decreasing interest in videos of YouTube personalities or whether YouTube has changed how it counts views. One theory being pushed around is that YouTube is purging views that it considers as having been generated by bots as opposed to real human beings. The problem with this theory is that it fails to explain a decline that has been going on for months.\n\nThere has also been speculation that the declining viewership numbers are a consequence of a tweak in the search ad promotion algorithms that YouTube employs which are assigning less weight to the number of subscribers when doing an evaluation of individual videos. Though YouTube has denied it, there has also been speculation that YouTube is engaged in an effort of unsubscribing users.\n\nFigures questioned\n\nThe figures from SocialBlade have been criticized by no less than YouTube itself. The social statistics tracker has however stood by its study.\n\n“Ouch ;( We don’t make up data. We get it from the YouTube API. We rely on it for accuracy. If it has issues maybe ping them?” SocialBlade tweeted back in response to critics who were casting doubt on the study.\n\nIn the last trading session that took place on December 23, 2016, shares of Alphabet fell by 0.23% to close the day at $807.80.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ -0.001806526806526806 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.2905594405594406 ], "publish_date" : [ null ] }

The Dutch company then transfers this money on to Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited, which has the right to license Google’s intellectual property outside the U.S. That company is based in Bermuda, which has no corporate income tax.

The main purpose of this subsidiary is to route Google’s profits to and from its Irish subsidiaries, which are located in a low-tax jurisdiction and are responsible for Google’s IP outside the United States. Money from the Netherlands office is routed to Bermuda, which has zero corporate income tax. Google moved $15.5 billion to this company in 2015. In 2014, that figure was approximately $12 billion. (See also: How Big Corporations Avoid Tax Bills).\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg report, Google’s effective income tax rate outside the United States was 6.5 percent in 2015 and the company routed $58.3 billion of its profits to the Bermuda tax haven. Google's income tax outside the U.S. was 6 percent in 2014. In a statement, Google said that it complies with tax laws “in every country that we operate.” To be sure, the company’s elaborate ruse to avoid taxes is the result of a prohibitive income tax at home. President-elect Donald Trump has offered a flat taxation rate of 10% to technology companies to make it easier for them to repatriate their profits back home.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Google’s tax strategy is sure to draw the attention of EU Commissioner Margarethe Vestager, who hinted earlier this year that the company could be the organization’s next target after Apple Inc. (AAPL). (See also: After Apple, EU Takes Aim At Amazon). According to a study conducted earlier this year, tax evasion by corporate entities cost the EU between $54.5 billion and $76.4 billion. Governments in France and Spain have already conducted raids on Google’s offices. The idea of a “Google Tax” is also spreading across the world. For example, Indonesia has asked the company to pony up back taxes or pay as much as $223 million in fines.

Given sluggish user and revenue trends, and what appears to be limited interest from potential acquirers at current enterprise value, we can understand management’s increased emphasis in these areas.”\n\nUltimately, “Fabric’s development tools, including the top-rated Crashlytics and Answers app stability kits, grew to reach nearly 2.5 billion active mobile devices in two years. Despite the early success of Fabric, we believe Twitter’s decision to divest makes sense as part of a broader strategic move toward the company’s core services,” Sebastian concludes.\n\nColin Sebastian has a very good TipRanks score with a 74% success rate and a high ranking of #18 out 4,350 analysts.

A few months ago, Google released its similar offering, the Home speaker, which offers functionality similar to the Echo. While the device was previously available in the US, it will now be coming to the UK in Summer.\n\nAlong with this announcement, Rick Osterloh, Google’s Vice President of Hardware, noted that the device's AI skills and large data would provide it a major edge over the competition.\n\nAmazon's Echo has been available in the US, Germany, and UK since September last year, so the Google Home has a lot of ground to cover. With more manufacturers getting into this product category, it could only be a matter of time before Apple comes up with its offering as well.\n\nAccording to a report from the last year, Apple could be working on a Siri powered accessory which would be equipped with a speaker and mic similar to the aforementioned devices. The device's mic would always be on so as to accept commands for playing music, settings timer, performing searches, and much more.\n\nHowever, a later report conjectured that all of these features would be incorporated into the next version of the Apple TV rather than a standalone device. Bloomberg reported that these features were in testing; however, Analyst Tim Bajarin has noted that Apple may not be working on a separate device using Siri but is trying to make Siri available across its entire device lineup.", "By Mukta Samtani Published : February 28, 2017\n\nJeff Bezos Is the Unbeatable Edge of AMZN Stock\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock hit a high of $848.64 on Monday and appears to be gradually inching toward another record closing.\n\n“Amazon Studios” just won three Oscars at the 89th Academy Awards, and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos couldn’t be happier. There are many factors supporting AMZN stock, but the most important one is its chief, Bezos.\n\nEven Warren Buffett acknowledges this fact. While the world has been going crazy over Buffett buying Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and airline stocks, the more important story turned out to be the one stock that he missed buying.\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC, the billionaire investor reflected that he really missed the boat on Amazon. He said, “Obviously, I should have bought it long ago,” but he added, “I didn’t understand the power of the model.” (Source: “Warren Buffett on Amazon: ‘I don’t have a good answer’ on why I didn’t buy it long ago,” CNBC, February 27, 2017.)\n\nHe was full of praise for the Amazon founder and CEO, whom he called a “terrific businessperson.” The business acumen of Jeff Bezos is what has transformed an online book seller to an e-commerce and technology powerhouse of today, pushing Amazon stock to $800.00-plus levels.\n\nBezos is never out of great ideas to push Amazon’s growth higher. “Amazon Prime” membership is the best example of this. The privileges that come with a Prime subscription are hard to ignore and, given the competitive pricing, it is hard for customers to not opt for one. The growing number of Prime memberships good proof of this, and has done magic to the impressive rise of AMZN stock.\n\n“Amazon Alexa” was another masterstroke by Jeff Bezos, and the surprise success of the company’s “Echo” line of speakers left many impressed. At a time when everybody thought that Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) would be the leader in digital assistants, Amazon Alexa-powered Echo speakers took the market by storm.\n\nI wrote earlier in Profit Confidential that Amazon Alexa is one of the top reasons to remain bullish on Amazon stock. And, being the super businessperson that he is, Bezos understands that Amazon Alexa needs to be ready as the battle with “Google Assistant” heats up in the near future.\n\nAmazon.com has been taking steps to do just that. Amazon Alexa already supports almost 10,000 skills, with the number likely to climb up further. At the Consumer Electronics Show this year (CES 2017), a number of firms in electronics and household appliances announced their product integration with Alexa. And now another piece of good news come from the 2017 Mobile World Congress (MWC).\n\nMotorola has picked Amazon Alexa as its voice assistant. The company has announced a partnership with Amazon that will see the latter’s voice assistant tech embedded natively into most of Motorola’s devices in the future. (Source: “Motorola picks Amazon’s Alexa as its voice assistant,” TechCrunch, February 26, 2017.)\n\nSpeaking at a press conference at the MWC trade show in Barcelona, Dan Dery, Motorola’s VP global product lead, said, “Later this year will see deep integration of Alexa wake-up words. There won’t be any keys to press, no screen to unlock – you will simply talk to Alexa when the device is around.” He further added that Alexa would be coming to most of their devices. (Source: Ibid.)\n\nThere are also reports that Google Assistant is coming soon on millions of new “Android” devices. Even though Google has an upper hand in search capabilities, it would be interesting to see who emerges as the winner in this battle.\n\nAmazon is betting big on the Alexa platform, and is not leaving any stone unturned to make it the best. Alexa is expected to be a big boost for the company and AMZN stock. The latest piece of news confirms this.\n\nAccording to TIME Magazine, the online retail giant is developing advanced voice recognition for Alexa. Amazon has been developing a feature that would allow its voice assistant to distinguish between individual users based on their voices, according to people familiar with the company’s Alexa strategy. (Source: “Exclusive: Amazon Developing Advanced Voice-Recognition for Alexa,” TIME, February 27, 2017.)\n\nSo far, none of the well-known voice-enabled smart speakers have been able to distinguish who in a family is asking for something. Amazon’s new feature would match the person speaking to a voice sample, or “voice print,” to verify a person’s identity, according to TIME‘s source.\n\nA user could set it so a parent’s voice would be required to make a credit card purchase. This capability is internally named as “Voice ID.” Distinguishing different voices of family members could be a big relief for parents as accidental shopping incidents could be minimized. While Echo speakers currently let the users build multiple profiles, the Voice ID feature would allow them to access their accounts without the need to switch between them or use Alexa app for the same.\n\nThe technology has been completed; it’s just a matter of integrating the feature into Echo products, said one of TIME’s sources. Voice ID could give the Echo a competitive edge against rival “Google Home” and could be a game changer for Amazon stock.\n\nThe below Amazon stock chart shows the phenomenal run of the stock over the last three months.\n\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n\nAnd to end it all on a high note, Amazon’s Manchester by the Sea and The Salesman won three Oscars on Sunday night. Manchester by the Sea won for Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay whereas The Salesman won the Oscar for the Best Foreign Film. Jeff Bezos was present at the ceremony and tweeted his congratulations to the winners.\n\nIt was a historic achievement for the streaming industry as Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) also won its first Oscar for the documentary The White Helmets. Although Netflix has received Oscar nominations in the past, the streaming giant has never been nominated in the Best Picture category.\n\nWith Manchester by the Sea, Amazon took a different approach from other services by releasing the film in traditional theaters before its streaming debut. Amazon reportedly paid $10.0 million for the rights to the movie at the Sundance Film Festival a year ago. The film debuted in November and is set for release on Amazon in May. (Source: “Amazon wins 3 Oscars in a first for streaming audio – and Jeff Bezos gets a fun shout-out,” GeekWire, February 26, 2017.)\n\nWith the strength and potential of “Amazon Prime Video” and Amazon Alexa, both Jeff Bezos and Amazon stock are likely to grab headlines in the coming days. AMZN stock has returned 53% over the last year—as compared to the S&P 500 Index that posted 24% gains in the same time period—and will likely continue inching upwards. Investors have a lot to look forward to this year, and Bezos is expected to be at the top of his game." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1114795918367347, 0.2095701298701299 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3371315192743764, 0.4466409090909091 ], "publish_date" : [ null, { "$date" : "2017-02-28T10:26:24.000+0000" } ] }

This was after it was ruled against by the French Constitutional Council. According to Reuters, the fiscal measure had been designed with the intention of making it harder for multinationals to pay as little tax as possible in France.\n\nLuring foreign investors and businesses\n\nThe ruling by France’s Constitutional Council comes amidst a government plan to increase the attractiveness of the country in the eyes of foreign firms following the British referendum that voted in favor of leaving the European Union.\n\n‘Google tax’ had been targeted at the multinationals that use tax regimes of different countries in a bid to lower tax liabilities. It had already been included in the 2017 budget law of France though the government has since admitted its reservations over the plans.\n\nFrance’s Constitutional Council also made the expansion of the planned financial transactions tax valid. This means that beginning 2018, intra-day transactions will have to pay the financial transactions tax. But depending on the outcome of the elections that are to be held in 2017, this might be challenged.\n\nTaxing at source in one year’s time\n\nThe Constitutional Council also validated a plan by the government to have the French taxed at source beginning 2018. This will mean that income tax payments will be deducted by employers from the gross pay a year from now. Currently, it is upon employees to declare their income and then settle the tax bill individually.\n\nThe decision by France’s Constitutional Court comes a little more than a week since the passing of a new budget law that could impose severe penalties on large US internet firms such as Google, Uber, and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) for tax avoidance practices. It is understood that the measure will put a stop to ‘diverted profits’.\n\n“A moral person domiciled or established outside of France is subject to income tax when a company or legal entity, whether established in France or not, conducts an activity that consists of the sale or supply of products or services,” states part of the measure.\n\nIn Thursday’s trading shares of Alphabet Inc fell by 0.21% to close the day at $802.88 a piece.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.01653639570306237 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.2982944524611191 ], "publish_date" : [ null ] }

Here is the difference in the profit loss graph, where the red line is a normal short put spread and the blue line is a short put spread with aWe can see a normal short put spread does have a risk control in place -- there is a maximum loss.

And, to add context, here is how this option strategy has done relative to the stock. And the stock... it's up just 9.8% in the last year.

Its milestone is over and above Netflix’s 116 million hours and the 100 million hours of daily streaming on Facebook.\n\nWhat was YouTube’s strategy to trump its rivals?\n\nA few years ago the company gave priority to viewing time over clicks.

There is a speculation that the video-sharing platform reached 185.9 million monthly US users in 2017. Monica Peart, eMarketer senior forecasting director points out that more and more viewers are becoming aware of YouTube.\n\nThe company has gone ahead to introduce a lightweight app in India as well. In the meantime, Alphabet’s stock closed at $849.67 witnessing an increase of $1.86 or 0.22%.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "On YouTube’s official blog, Cristos Goodrow, vice president of engineering at YouTube, the huge video site, owned by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), reported its traffic had reached a remarkable milestone:\n\nA few years back, we made a big decision at YouTube. While everyone seemed focused on how many views a video got, we thought the amount of time someone spent watching a video was a better way to understand whether a viewer really enjoyed it. It wasn’t an easy call, but we thought it would help us make YouTube a more engaging place for creators and fans. And last year, we hit a big milestone on that journey: people around the world are now watching a billion hours of YouTube’s incredible content every single day!\n\nGoogle, the former name for Alphabet, bought YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion. For years, it was not a major contributor to Google revenue. Recently, that has changed. YouTube’s revenue last year was pegged at over $10 billion.\n\nYouTube has experimented with several business models. Among those are paid premium video services, meant to compete primarily with Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). However, YouTube has never been a major player in this business. Instead, Alphabet management has recently focused on video advertising, which tends to carry hefty premiums over traditional online advertising. Recently, Apple, Mr. Clean, Budweiser and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) have been large advertisers, based on data from the January YouTube Advertiser Leader Board.\n\nCNBC pointed out that YouTube has become more popular than Netflix and Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) combined.", "YouTube viewers worldwide are now watching more than 1 billion hours of videos a day, threatening to eclipse U.S. television viewership, a milestone fueled by the Google unit’s aggressive embrace of artificial intelligence to recommend videos.\n\nYouTube surpassed the figure, which is far larger than previously reported, late last year. It represents a 10-fold increase since 2012, YouTube said, when it started building algorithms that tap user data to give each user personalized video lineups designed to keep them watching longer. Feeding those recommendations is an unmatched collection of content: 400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube each minute, or 65 years of video a day.\n\nFacebook Inc. FB, +0.63% and Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.90% said in January 2016 that users watch 100 million hours and 116 million hours, respectively, of video daily on their platforms. Nielsen data suggest Americans watch on average roughly 1.25 billion hours of live and recorded TV a day, a figure steadily dropping in recent years.\n\nDespite its size, it is unclear if YouTube is making money. Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +1.28% GOOGL, +1.10% doesn’t disclose YouTube’s performance, but people familiar with its financials said it took in about $4 billion in revenue in 2014 and roughly broke even.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\n\nWhy more men are going into debt for plastic surgery (2:10) Men's plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures have grown 325% over the past 20 years.

The founders were all ex-Google business development employees.\n\nAcquisition Terms and Rationale\n\nThe two companies did not disclose the consideration for the deal.\n\nIt is likely Google paid under $10 million for the acquisition due to its very early stage of development.\n\nAccording to the team at Cronologics, they saw \"strong alignment with Android Wear's mission...to continue pushing the frontier of wearable technology and smartwatches with Android Wear 2.0 and beyond.\"\n\nThe deal has the earmarks of a typical \"acqui-hire.\" Google likely saw a talented team with some compelling ideas that it could use to move its wearable technology initiatives forward.\n\nCommentary\n\nGoogle, along with smartwatch makers Apple, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) and others, has made admirable attempts to develop a smartwatch platform that intrigues consumers.\n\nHowever, like the others, Google has largely failed to make a system compelling enough to be category-defining.\n\nWith the acqui-hire of Cronologics, Google is getting another perspective on the smartwatch segment and bringing cross-platform experience in-house.\n\nI believe the major smartwatch players view the smartwatch as the first interface into wearable computing, and as such, are investing in obtaining market knowledge as they attempt to continue product development, miniaturization and new materials.\n\nCronologics' competency was in operating systems and interfaces, two important elements in the nascent wearables industry.\n\nHolding a smartphone in your hand is a different proposition than \"wearing\" a device on your body and consumer expectations are still being figured out.\n\nI don't expect major breakthroughs from the acquisition because I believe that wearables will become important when the hardware becomes lighter and form fitting, like Apple's soon-to-ship AirPods.\n\nRather, expect the next iteration of Android Wear 3.0 to contain some input and technology from the new incoming team as Google makes incremental improvements to the platform's capabilities.\n\nI write about IPOs, follow ons, secondaries, and M&A deals.

This marks the second project that the Mountain View, Calif.-based company has exited in less than a week.\n\nAnd that's not the end of it. The company's robot division, Boston Dynamics, is on the block for a sale, while it has also instituted cuts to Google X, the company's division for wild ideas.\n\nGoogle's moves are a sobering about-turn for a company famous for its moonshots. The decision to rein them in is part of the company's renewed focus on paring down costs after the arrival of former Morgan Stanley CFO Ruth Porat. They are also proof that the company's zeal to reinvent entire industries may have hit a reality roadblock. (See also: How Alphabet Inc. Reworked Its Letters This Year.)\n\nThe following is a list of industries that Google has pulled out of or applied the brakes on in the past couple of years.\n\nAugmented Reality (Google Glass)\n\nThe augmented reality glasses made a splash when they were first launched back in 2013. The device essentially consisted of a pair of glasses connected to the Internet and fitted with a camera that enabled wearers to browse the net and take photographs at the same time. However, even extravagant photo spreads in fashion magazines could not dim privacy concerns related to the device. They never caught on in mainstream society, and in 2015, Google closed the Explorer program associated with the device.\n\nBroadband (Google Fiber)\n\nKansas City made headlines in 2011 when it was selected to become the first city to receive Google Fiber. Subsequently, 12 more cities were added to the list of cities with Google's high-speed Internet broadband service. In October last year, the company announced a halting of expansion to new cities and cut down staff for the unit.\n\nBased on reports, the unit was responsible for a majority of the $280 million capital expenditures related in Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" division. But the company’s CFO Ruth Porat reminded investors in a quarterly call that the company still has a broadband presence in 18 cities (in addition to the Webpass acquisition). She said the company was pausing expansion for \"exploratory discussions\" and to \"integrate technology work.\" (See also: Google Halts Expansion Of Fiber Project.)\n\nSatellite Imaging (Terra Bella)\n\nWhen Google bought Skybox Imaging (the division's earlier name) for $500 million in 2014, it wanted to use the startup's technology for Google Maps and to spread Internet access in remote regions of the world. Two years later, however, the company seems to have rethought that mission and is reported to be in talks to sell the division off to a competitor in exchange for an equity stake. (See also: Alphabet in Talks to Sell Satellite Imaging Startup.)\n\nRobotics (Boston Dynamics)\n\nGoogle acquired Boston Dynamics in 2013 for an undisclosed sum and established a robotics division called Replicant in 2014. It released viral videos about life with robots earlier this year. However, the robotics unit is said to be up for sale after senior executives concluded that the unit will not be making money, at least for the next couple of years. The move also represents a possible end to Google's foray into robotics. According to a Bloomberg report last year, there is no longer a separate robotics division within Google. (See also: Why Alphabet Is Looking to Sell Its Robotics Unit.)", "In 2014, Google and Facebook Inc. vied to acquire Titan Aerospace, a maker of high-altitude, solar-powered drones. Google won the bidding, so Facebook purchased its own company, which was building a huge glider called Aquila.\n\nThe idea was to beam internet access from the sky to get more people logging on from remote places to access information and probably use both companies’ web services. That soaring vision has come down to Earth with a bump.\n\nOn Wednesday, a spokeswoman from Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s X research lab said it had shut down Titan. This happened in early 2016, she said, although confirmation didn’t come until earlier today, when technology blog 9to5Google reported the move.\n\nThe team from Titan was brought into X in late 2015, and the research lab ended its exploration of high-altitude drones for internet access shortly after, the X spokeswoman said in a statement.\n\nFacebook has also struggled. Its Aquila drone crashed during a test flight in June, sparking an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. That was the latest hiccup in Facebook’s plans to wirelessly connect the world, following an explosion earlier in 2016 that destroyed one of its satellites and political resistance to its free services in India.\n\nAlphabet canceled Titan because of economic and technical challenges. Project Loon, another X project to beam internet from high-altitude balloons, is still going. So is Project Wing, an effort to use drones for deliveries, rather than internet service.\n\n\"By comparison, at this stage the economics and technical feasibility of Project Loon present a much more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world,\" the X spokeswoman said on Wednesday. \"Many people from the Titan team are now using their expertise as part of other high flying projects at X, including Loon and Project Wing.\"\n\nProject Wing is facing its own challenges. In the fall of 2016, several Wing employees were asked to find other projects at Alphabet after X pulled back on some of its drone delivery plans.", "Alphabet Inc. said it shut an effort to beam internet service from highflying drones, part of a number of moves by the Google parent to rein in less-promising initiatives and focus on those more likely to produce profit.\n\nThe drone project, called Titan, was folded in early 2016, though Google confirmed the move only this week.\n\nA spokeswoman Thursday said X, Alphabet’s unit that pursues moonshot initiatives, is still working..." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.009811348781937018, 0.119962962962963, 0.2 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.2977644087938205, 0.3889259259259258, 0.76 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-01-12T18:06:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-11T00:00:00.000+0000" }, null ] }

However, Waymo, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google’s a self-driving car subsidiary company intends to find a way of overcoming these barriers.\n\nIt is yet to hold a public launch of its self-driving technology; not until it is sure of being able to tackle the challenging road conditions its autonomous vehicle are likely to face. Not only does the deep cold and blanketing snow affect traction and vehicle handling but it also damages the sensors and optics.\n\nThe testing of Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans\n\nThe testing of Waymo’s Pacifica vans on public roads began in January in both California and Arizona. The minivans were taken to a mild environment of Silicon Valley before being exposed to more harsh conditions. However, a recent tweet image by Waymo’s CEO John Krafcik shows a picture of the self-driving minivans in the snow in South Lake Tahoe, Calif.\n\nDriving in rain and snow requires windshield wipers. Apparently, Waymo seems to have one in place that is expected to meet the demands of bad weather. In a blog post, the company stated, “We’ve had to come up with our own equivalent of a windscreen wiper on the (sensor-containing) dome to ensure our sensors have the best view possible.”\n\nWaymo expects to extend its testing of its self-driving minivans to other areas\n\nWaymo is currently confining the testing of its self-driving minivans at South Lake Tahoe in California. Apart from the fact that the location provides snowy environs, it is also within the domain of its license to test autonomous systems.\n\nHowever, there is room for flexibility. Thus it is also targeting other areas that have severe weather conditions the likes of Michigan and Kirkland. The exploration is expected to enhance the focus on the improvement of the minivans.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu\n\nSAN FRANCISCO When Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] was raising venture capital in 2013, it was one of the hottest deals around – and no one was more eager to write a check than Bill Maris and David Krane of Google's venture capital arm.\n\nNot everyone at Google Ventures, since renamed GV, agreed. The firm already had an investment in a competitor, Sidecar, and Uber was demanding what then looked like a sky-high valuation.\n\nMaris and Krane prevailed, and the deal is now regarded as GV’s greatest success. On paper, the firm's initial 2013 investment of $258 million gained about 14 times its value over the next three years to more than $3.5 billion.\n\nBut now Alphabet Inc, Google's corporate parent, is suing Uber for theft of trade secrets, alleging that one of the top engineers in its self-driving car program decamped with thousands of confidential files, including designs that helped him start self-driving truck company Otto and then quickly sell it to Uber. Uber denies those claims.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by Alphabet’s self-driving car unit Waymo, has jolted the fast-growing and highly competitive industry that has sprung up around autonomous vehicles and ride services, which are seen as the future of private road transport.\n\nYet the confrontation was a long time in the making: the complex relationship between the companies was tense from the start, according to people familiar with the situation, and soured further as they increasingly competed with each other.\n\nNow, if the Waymo suit damages Uber, GV's investment in the ride-hailing company stands to go down as a Silicon Valley rarity: a large funding deal undermined by the firm's own investors.\n\n“Whatever Waymo gains, Google Ventures loses,” said Stephen Diamond, associate professor of law at Santa Clara University.\n\nThe lawsuit is just one in a series of recent public setbacks for Uber, including allegations of sexual harassment that prompted an internal investigation, a video of Chief Executive Travis Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver that led him to make a public apology, and Uber's admission on Friday that it used a secret tracking tool to avoid authorities.\n\n“We have reviewed Waymo's claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court,\" Uber said in a statement in response to the lawsuit. \"In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world.”\n\nA spokeswoman for GV declined to comment.\n\nDEAL AT ANY COST\n\nUber was more than just another investment for then-fledgling Google Ventures, which needed a high-profile deal to put it on the map.\n\nMaris and Krane were early Uber fans, but it took about two years for the pair to connect with Kalanick. When Uber investor Benchmark finally brokered a meeting in May 2013, the Google Ventures partners were determined to do a deal at virtually any cost, according to two sources close to the transaction.\n\nWith other would-be investors waiting in adjacent conference rooms at Uber’s San Francisco offices, Maris and Krane made their pitch to invest. Kalanick pushed for a higher valuation, without a board seat; Google Ventures pushed back, asking for a board observer seat and a liquidation preference for protection if Uber was sold at a loss, one of the sources said.\n\nThey finally came to terms, with a $3.5 billion valuation, and there were signs that a broader alliance could be in the offing. Separately, David Drummond, Google's senior vice president of corporate development, had a social relationship with Kalanick, and he joined the board.\n\nA ride in a self-driving car and a meeting with Google CEO Larry Page, recounted in Brad Stone's recent book \"The Upstarts,\" seemed to bode well for the relationship.\n\nBut conflicts emerged immediately. Kalanick, a tough negotiator, wanted a discount on the software tools behind Google Maps, the company's ubiquitous mapping software, according to a person close to the transaction. The best Google Ventures could offer was close contact between Uber and Google’s mapping team, the person said.\n\nKalanick also wanted Uber to be featured prominently in Google Maps, eventually giving customers a way to hail an Uber ride directly from Maps, and Google agreed, a source close to Uber said. But Uber felt Google dragged its heels on the integration and found the initial rollout disappointing, the source said.\n\nThe friction only grew as Uber turned its attention to autonomous driving, an area where Google had already established an early lead. Uber announced its intentions in typically abrupt style in early 2015, poaching 40 faculty and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University to set up a self-driving lab in Pennsylvania.\n\nIt bought mapping software firm deCarta and began investing heavily in its own mapping systems. Meanwhile, Google launched an on-demand delivery service, a market Uber is also chasing, and began offering a carpooling service through driving app Waze, which it acquired in 2013. The carpooling feature in particular rankled Uber, a source close to the company said.\n\n\"Things escalated from frenemy to now enemy quite quickly,\" said Anand Sanwal, CEO and co-founder of venture capital research firm CB Insights.\n\nThe tension bubbled to the surface last August, when Drummond stepped down from Uber’s board.\n\nUber declined comment on any of its dealings with Google and did not make Kalanick available for an interview.\n\nUNDERMINED BY ITS OWN INVESTORS?\n\nUber’s aggressive culture was the subject of many conversations at Google Ventures, a source close to the transaction said. Hoping to influence the startup, the venture firm at first encouraged a flow of talent from Google to Uber.\n\nYet that too ultimately created problems. Anthony Levandowski, a key engineering manager at the self-driving car unit, now called Waymo, began to talk openly about leaving the company as the autonomous vehicle field blossomed, according to Alphabet's lawsuit.\n\nIn January 2016, Levandowski and some colleagues quit Alphabet to form the self-driving truck start-up Otto, which Uber acquired later that year for $680 million. Alphabet claims in its lawsuit that Levandowski had been in touch with Uber even before he left Alphabet.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Alphabet alleges Levandowski downloaded 14,000 proprietary design documents and used them to create Otto's - and later Uber's - version of a key autonomous vehicle technology called Lidar, which uses light pulses reflected off objects to gauge their position.\n\nUber and Levandowski deny the allegations.\n\nThe high-stakes legal showdown over whether vital information was transferred between the two companies is perhaps the logical conclusion of their opaque relationship.\n\nAll along, Uber remained mysterious to its Google Ventures investors. Kalanick was adamant from the start that he would share little information, and try as it might, Google Ventures could not gain better visibility over time, two sources said. If anything, Kalanick grew more tight-lipped as his business matured.\n\n“It was one of the few companies where we sat there and said, 'Hope it goes well,'\" one of the sources said.\n\n(Reporting by Julia Love and Heather Somerville; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Bill Rigby)" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.08823903396484042 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4490348182283667 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-06T09:40:53.000+0000" } ] }

Iyer, IFC Published : December 9, 2016\n\nNew Tailwinds for Google Stock\n\nAlthough we usually think of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) as a sprawling business, 99% of the company’s revenues are advertising-related. Google stock (GOOG) is almost entirely concentrated in this one sector, but that could change very soon.\n\nAfter years of research and development, Google is finally ready to package its self-driving program into an actual business. This would mean spinning the driverless project out of “Google X,” the experimental lab where the company tests out new ideas, into a newly formed entity. (Source: “Google’s self-driving car team is hiring executives as it prepares to spin out from Alphabet’s X,” Recode, December 7, 2016.)\n\nIf you ever wondered why Google reorganized itself into Alphabet, wonder no more.\n\nThese kinds of transitions are exactly why. In the founding letter, Google founder Larry Page wrote: “Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google.”\n\nBy Page’s telling, Google’s moonshot ideas would eventually outgrow the company, so the company needed room for them to breathe. Under the new structure, they could evolve into full companies and have their own chief executive officers, all of whom would still report to Page.\n\nThis is what we think is happening for the driverless car project.\n\nThe first rumblings came from the head of the project himself, John Krafcik, when he spoke at the Nikkei Innovation Forum in October. Krafcik was vague about the timeline, but he made it clear that driverless cars were going to “graduate” from Google X’s lab.\n\nNow we’re seeing conspicuous hires to the driverless car team. For instance, Kevin Vosen was hired as the project’s chief legal officer. To the layperson, this hiring looks harmless. But Google X already has lawyers. The new hire, skilled as he may be, is a duplicate that makes no sense.\n\nThat is, unless self-driving cars will become a new company under the Alphabet banner. Other recent additions to the Google workforce also seem redundant. Why else would they hire a second “head of real estate” if not to make sure that the new division was staffed properly?\n\nOnly one answer explains all of the above: Google’s autonomous car division is almost open for business.\n\nExisting carmakers like Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) have signed deals to license the driverless tech from Google, which is a clever way for Google to ride the autonomous car trend without the heavy costs of vehicle production.\n\nMoreover, the market seems ignorant of its effect on Google stock (GOOG). Investors still believe that self-driving cars are 20 or 30 years down the road, but the writing on the wall says otherwise.\n\nIf driverless cars truly graduate from Google X, it’s because Alphabet executives expect it to make a lot of money. With this potential growth not priced into Google stock (GOOG), I expect there to be enormous returns waiting for the patient tech investor." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.09695391414141413 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4824273989898989 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-09T05:58:31.000+0000" } ] }

Mobile manufacturers who have also partnered with Google include Micromax and Lava.\n\nWith this partnership in place, the carriers will now support RCS messaging powered by the Jibe RCS cloud from Google and will be preloading Android Messages (formerly called Messenger for Android) as the standard native messaging app for their subscribers. “We’re also announcing that the Vodafone Group RCS service is supporting Android Messages and has already launched across 10 markets for Vodafone subscribers globally,” the company said in its blog post.\n\nTo recall, RCS or Rich Communication Services is essentially a new standard for carrier-based messaging that would allow high-res photo sharing ability, group chats, and other capabilities that were not offered by the previous communication standard. The firm has institutional ownership of 81.90%, while insider ownership included 0.10%. Its price to sales ratio ended at 6.44. GOOGL attains analyst recommendation of 1.70 with week’s performance of 0.67%.\n\nSanofi (NYSE:SNY) [Trend Analysis] try to make new thrust in street and making different trends, stocks trading ended with 0.48% to $42.90. Sanofi (SNY) and Lonza (LZAGY) reported that they have entered into a strategic partnership to build and operate a large-scale mammalian cell culture facility for monoclonal antibody production in Visp, Switzerland.\n\nThe strategic partnership in the form of a joint venture combines the strong biologics development pipeline of Sanofi with the expertise of Lonza to design, construct, start-up and operate a state-of- the-art large-scale mammalian cell culture facility. The initial investment will be around CHF 290 million (270 million), to be split equally between each company. The share price of SNY attracts active investors, as stock price of week volatility recorded 1.14%.

Specifically, YouTube is reducing the number of views of his videos while some of his videos are no longer accessible for his subscribers. What bothers him the most is that YouTube does not give an acceptable and proper explanation as to why.\n\nKjellberg has noted that the changes imposed by YouTube through time feels more like a “kick in the face”. Moreover, with YouTube employees being completely clueless about what it’s like to be a content producer on the platform and to actually produce content, he now wants to quit one of the biggest channels on YouTube. This is consistent with his previous statement that he will permanently delete his channel after reaching the 50-million-subscriber mark.\n\nNonetheless, it is important to note that Kjellberg does not plan to quit being a content producer on YouTube entirely. Once he deletes PewDiePie, he plans to create a new channel and build it again from the ground up.\n\n“I’ve decided the only way to stop my channel from dying— I know you are going to think I am joking— but I am going to delete my channel,” elaborated Kjellberg.\n\nYouTube’s Argument\n\nOn the other hand, YouTube has maintained that it is not intentionally reducing the number of video views or number of subscribers of certain users at all.\n\nUpon reviewing the concerns, YouTube has found out that some subscribers are unsubscribing from channels on their own. Also, YouTube has emphasized that it regularly reviews and removes spam accounts to provide all users with a healthy environment free from spam and anything that may compromise a valuable experience. Consequently, this ensures that all viewer and subscriber counts are accurate. After all, these statistics play a major role in determining the revenue of users.\n\nAlphabet has closed at $791.47 on Wednesday, rising 1.97%.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "On April 23, 2005, the very first YouTube video was released. Eleven years later, YouTube has grown to have 5 billion videos watched a day, 1.3 billion total number of users, an estimated annual revenue of $10 billion for 2016 and yet it is not profitable. In fact at a recent summit, the CEO of YouTube had stated that it is still in investment mode. Originally purchased in October 2006 by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for $1.65 billion, it is now estimated to have a valuation of $70 to $90 billion on its own. Making about 13% - 17% of the current market cap of Google, we wanted to do some analysis of the risks and opportunities that YouTube has coming ahead. Especially since there have been recent videos put out by major content creators including PewDiePie, the #1 most subscribed YouTuber, contemplating quitting the service.\n\nHistory\n\nStarting out as a failed dating website, who knew YouTube would end up being the central hub for video content today. Chad Hurley, Steven Chen and Jawed Karim came up with the idea back in 2005 when they figured the website would work as a dating website where single people would post up videos of themselves to attract others for dates. In fact on the main page of the website you would be entering in your sex and age. Like most success stories, this one had humble beginnings. No one used the first iteration of this website. The creators were so desperate for users that they put Craiglist ads to pay for people to upload videos on their website.\n\nIt was the original community who really defined what YouTube would be. Instead of making dating related videos, users would instead upload videos of everything else to share with their friends and family. The original community of YouTube was what led the original founders to revamp the site to be more open and general to entice others to upload videos of whatever they wanted. This is the backbone of what YouTube is today. After Sequoia Capital help fund this venture and began looking for advertisement deals, YouTube began to really hit off with the general public. In fact it was this famous Nike Ad to be the first video to reach a million views. In 2006, Google purchased the company after seeing the potential this platform had for advertising. The following is a synopsis of risks and opportunities we see ahead for YouTube.\n\nYouTubers quitting and increased competition\n\nIt was this video by YouTuber PewDiePie quitting that inspired me to write this article. Now it remains to be seen how serious he is to go through with this promise but there is always a risk of talent leaving and taking their subscriber base as well. His main complaint was the subscriber dumps that YouTube would go through from time to time. YouTube does this to get rid of \"ghost\" accounts. \"Ghost\" accounts are determined based on their viewing history and will be removed from a channel if they have not had any recent views of that channel. Although it does hurt a channel from an aesthetics point of view due to lowering their subscriber, this is a necessary process. By removing accounts that no longer watch your content, it allows YouTube and the advertisers find a better match for their ads based on your subscriber base.\n\nThere are many reasons why YouTubers quit such as stress or running out of creativity. However there has also been some instances of poaching. Two years ago, there was a huge push by Yahoo to reinvent itself and become more competitive with Google. One of their tactics was to lure content creators by enticing them with higher ad revenue share. Currently Google retains 45% of the advertising earned by content creators. In 2015, Vessel was on the hunt trying to poach content creators by enticing creators with higher CPMs. YouTubers earn about $2-3/CPM vs. what Vessel claimed to be able to provide $50/CPM. Their caveat was that content creators also would release videos on their website three days ahead of being released on YouTube, creating an early access pay wall. Coincidentally, both of the aforementioned companies were both purchased by Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in 2016. Although there has yet to be a viable competitor, there will always be future competitors who will attempt to dethrone YouTube. There has been a lot of consolidation in the media place such as AT&T (NYSE:T) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) and I would not be surprised if a media giant were to attempt enter the online video space in the future.\n\nThe Black market of Online Advertising\n\nYouTube marketing is strong because it can achieve the holy grail of marketing, which is advocacy. Advocacy in marketing is a term which describes the type of marketing that we receive from friends and families. YouTube builds this relationship with viewers through the trust gained by the content creators. In a recent Nielsen report, it found that users trusted online consumer opinions 66% of the time when making a purchase. Due to the fact that YouTube is on the frontier or marketing, it is no surprise that it has also created its own \"black-market\" for advertising.\n\nOn a larger level there has been illegal product placement such as the Xbox One controversy. In summary what happened was that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was paying gaming channels to promote their product in a positive light without disclosure that they were being paid to do so. It is explicitly outlined on the FTC website that this is illegal.\n\nOn a smaller level there has been paid shills to YouTubers without disclosure (pictured below). The email below was to a fellow smaller YouTuber with only a few thousand subscribers who reviews tech parts. When he replied back to the email telling them they would review the product for free if they got a demo, they got back an email stating that they would only get the product if they gave positive reviews.\n\nIf the FTC were ever able to crack down on this illegal black market for advertising dollars it could serve to be a windfall to YouTube. Currently these advertising dollars are being diverted away from YouTube by going straight to the YouTuber. By removing this black market it would increase the amount of money going into legal advertising giving benefit to YouTube.\n\nValuation\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to know how much our investment in YouTube will be worth in the future. Since YouTube is not generating any earnings right now, the only method of valuation we can use is a price multiple on sales. Taking the average of related companies, the Max, the Min and Google's current valuation, we were able to get within the valuation metrics that were being touted by Wall Street. Next using the same metrics we wanted to calculate the value of YouTube in four years, 2020, to see how much the valuation of YouTube growth alone could add to Alphabet's market cap. The growth rates that UBS has proposed in YouTube revenues does present an interesting growth opportunity that implies as high as an annualized 8% share increase just based on YouTube's growth and assuming the rest of Alphabet does not grow at all.\n\nConclusion\n\nYouTube has grown up in the past 11 years and it still has a lot to grow. Based on the growth projections, Google could be a fantastic long-term holding for any portfolio. While the media may be over blowing the vast exodus of key subscribers of YouTube, it is clear that Wall Street will not quit on YouTube if there is money to be made.\n\nPlease hit the follow button above if you would like me to go further into the business of YouTube.

While it is difficult to peg a price target on Alphabet with traditional valuation methods, I believe there is sufficient evidence that a large margin of safety exists at the current price level. I like to frame the opportunity something like this: Alphabet's Google division alone can easily justify the current stock price of a little more than $800 per share, with the venture capital arm and \"other bets\" essentially trading for free.\n\nGoogle division easily worth $800 per share\n\nWith revenue growth around 20% and a forward PE of near 20 after accounting for the net cash on the balance sheet, the valuation is very reasonable (and this includes the losses from Other Bets). The secular growth in online advertising revenue is showing no signs of slowing down. The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) reported in their Internet Advertising Revenue Report that online advertising has increased at a 17% clip since 2005, and was up 20% YoY in 2015. Mobile ad growth is the primary reason for the recent acceleration.\n\nThe pace has kept up thus far in 2016. IAB reported in their Q3 2016 update that internet ad revenues climbed 20% YoY again in the quarter. Alphabet appears to be holding their market share, even with the surging Facebook, as they also announced similar revenue growth during the Q3 period.\n\nSurging internet ad revenue has come at the expense of the traditional media outlets, a trend expected to continue. Adding the broadcast and cable television lines together in the graph above you see that in 2015 internet ad revenue has caught up to television ad revenue. We will see internet ad revenue surpass broadcast and cable revenue for the first time in 2016.\n\nIn addition to being the most dominant player in search, Google has yet to seriously monetize their YouTube and Maps platforms, both of which have over one billion monthly users. Google is set up well to at least maintain their market share in fast growing interned advertising space, making a 20 P/E multiple look like a bargain.\n\nI love me some free options:\n\nWhile it is easier to illustrate why the downside at this price is limited for Alphabet, it is much harder to estimate a fair value. This is because the company has so many other bets spread around, each with option-like payoff profiles. What I mean by this is that the payoff on each investment is very similar to that of an out-of-the-money call option. The cost to acquire the option is small, but the most likely scenario is a loss of the capital invested. However, there is a small probability that payoff could be huge and uncapped. The more bets Alphabet makes into these potentially disruptive technologies and innovations, the more likely one of them turns into a home run. The payoffs of these bets are highly uncertain, but getting them for free is clearly a great value.\n\nAutonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, drone delivery, robotics and new forms of high-speed internet services are just a few examples of some of these other bets that could potentially yield high payoffs. Additionally, the venture capital arm could strike it rich with a timely investment in the next disruptive technology.\n\nThere are also plenty of bets going on inside of the Google division, which too are not properly valued in the share price. Of these, cloud services probably has the biggest potential. Google recently introduced Google Cloud as a new business unit that includes their collaboration and productivity applications, machine learning and data analytics tools, and application program interfaces. Google's access to vast amounts of data and their advancements and investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence should prove a compelling value proposition for cloud customers.\n\nRevenues from Google's cloud services are not broken out from the rest of Google revenues in their SEC filings, but management has indicated that cloud is growing quickly and that they are investing heavily. In Q3, Google other revenue (the line cloud rolls up under) was $2.4 billion, up 39% YoY with the growth explained on the earnings call as \"driven by Play and Cloud\" and that the cloud platform had the largest YoY growth of any revenue line.\n\nAnother signal from the earnings call that shows how much the company is investing in cloud is headcount growth, which grew 5% in Q3 alone, to 69,953. CFO Ruth Porat clarified that the \"vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud.\"\n\nIf even a modest market share were eventually carved out in this fast growing and highly profitable space, the effect on the stock price could be quite large. In their semi-annual Public Cloud Customer Research report, TBR forecasts that the public cloud market will reach $167B by 2020. In the report TBR also estimates that Google cloud revenues were $2.8B in 2015, or roughly 3.4% of the market. Based on the clues from the earnings calls I think we can assume cloud revenues are currently growing at an over 50% annual rate for Google. While perhaps not the base case, it is not unfathomable that Google could carve out a 10% market share by 2020. Using the TBR market estimates, this would be $16.7 billion in revenue. Applying a price-to-sales multiple of 6 we could be looking at a $100 billion cloud business by 2020. This free option is hard to pass up.\n\n(SOURCE: TBR Public Cloud Customer Research report)\n\nKey Risks:\n\nWhile Alphabet has a lot of opportunities for growth in new markets outside of advertising, the advertising business is still the engine that allows the company the luxury of making so many investments in early stage technologies. While I believe the fundamentals for owning Alphabet as these levels is strong, a prudent investor should keep a careful eye on revenue growth and margins to make sure the core advertising cash flow engine stays healthy.\n\nRevenue : I'd like to see advertising revenue continue to increase at a 15%-20% rate (before currency translation). The key metrics to monitor for advertising revenue are the aggregate change in paid clicks and the cost per click. Paid clicks has continued to trend up, rising 30% YoY in the first nine months of 2016. During the same period cost per click trended down 9%, likely due to increased competition from social media, a phenomenon seen across the industry. A slowdown in net advertising revenue growth below 15% in the next year would cause me to re-evaluate my thesis. Social media's share of internet ad spend also shouldn't be ignored, and warrants monitoring.\n\nI'd like to see advertising revenue continue to increase at a 15%-20% rate (before currency translation).

These costs have been trending up, due mainly to the growing mix of mobile traffic. Higher traffic acquisition costs for mobile is primarily due to paying Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBuy Alphabet's core Google business right now at a fair price, which has it's own upside potential from the continued secular growth of online advertising and the under-monetization of the Maps and YouTube businesses. Get for free all of the other bets and their inherent option-like payoffs profiles. Use your own judgment on the likelihood one or more of these bets succeed, along with the size of the prize, to gauge just how undervalued Alphabet is.\n\nDisclosure: I am/we are long GOOGL.\n\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Google has always excelled at showing the best ads against a search result, but that business may not last forever as the way people interact with technology starts to change rapidly.\n\nThat’s all fine as long as Google can keep those clicks growing and coming along, but as we’ve seen in the case of Apple’s smartphone market share topping out, there are only so many eyeballs to get ads in front of people. And for now, it might be able to keep its stock price in a good place. Google has to keep padding those impressions, or get creative around the way it advertises to its users. Wall Street, as usual, is looking for growth — especially in the largest companies in the world. Apple has more or less been punished (or at least, not rewarded) for its slowing smartphone sales and so far lack of dramatic new growth engines.\n\nAnd that’s just what the company has been doing. This year, Google unveiled two major new hardware products: the Pixel smartphone and the voice-driven living room assistant Google Home (in addition to a few smaller launches like Google Wifi and an updated Chromecast dongle). These more or less fit into the vision of getting people to engage with Google’s search engine in some active way with the hope that if Google figures out how to get it right, it’ll be able to monetize it down the line.\n\nWhether that will convince Wall Street that Google is able to get beyond the search engine by diversifying its touch points — whether that’s voice, phone, VR or any other new interactive medium — is still yet to be seen. Google’s core competency has always been advertising, and while it might be able to build a business on cloud services (as we’ve seen with Amazon is becoming very successful) or new hardware, Google still has so much data that if it can figure out next-generation advertising products on new mediums it might have a new fantastic growth story for Wall Street.\n\nIt needed to at least show that intent to Wall Street. A healthy stock price — and also a story about innovation and looking forward — is important to keep attracting the best talent. Google’s problems are some of the hardest in tech, and it needs to be able to tell a story to not only investors but prospective employees that they can work on those hard problems and also be well-compensated for doing so.\n\nGoogle is trying to flex the power of its machine learning algorithms, which given the data it has may arguably be the most powerful in the world. That helps Google understand complex queries from products like the Google Assistant — and get people to stick to Google’s voice interface versus Apple’s. Amazon exposed latent demand for a voice-driven interface with the Amazon Echo, and Google is essentially hoping to perfect the experience.\n\nAs such, while Google has shown that its advertising business isn’t so challenged, it’s showing that it’s already looking toward the future. And that’s been largely reflected in the company’s share price from Wall Street. Despite some bumps in the road, Google at the very least looks on track to hold steady or end the year up a bit from where it was around a year ago today:\n\nAll of Google’s efforts to figure out what the next-generation “search” interface will be will have to eventually play out. The way it works is this: Google’s paid clicks are going up, but the cost-per-click — which is the key metric Wall Street is looking at when it’s looking at the health of Google’s business — is still on the decline. That’s because mobile ads are generally less valuable than the company’s desktop search ads.\n\nHere’s a look at the decline, from the company’s last earnings report:\n\nAnd meanwhile, the paid clicks, also from the last earnings report:\n\nSo, if Google’s core business is eventually at risk of a slowdown, or decline, where does it go from here?\n\nGoogle has shown clear signs that it’s trying to diversify its revenue. Perhaps the largest indicator was the hiring of Diane Green and the ramping up of its cloud services tools in an attempt to challenge Amazon, whose AWS business is rapidly becoming a huge growth engine for Amazon without the excessive costly fiscal baggage of its retail business. Amazon unveiled a huge number of updates to its AWS service earlier this year — including literally driving a truck to your office to put your info into the cloud — and Google is going to be playing catch-up for a while. But, clearly, it’s trying to show Wall Street that it’s more than a search engine.\n\nThere’s also its increasing number of updates to its online productivity — which also puts it in competition with Microsoft. It’s also competing with Microsoft through both its cloud services and productivity tools, which Microsoft will never let you forget. And Apple is rapidly trying to ramp up its own services, regularly pointing to the success of things like Apple Music, in order to show Wall Street that it isn’t just a hardware company and can level the playing ground against companies looking to be a combo of hardware and software like Microsoft or google.\n\nAnd that’s also why there’s a whole section devoted to Google’s “other bets” in its earnings reports, though they haven’t shown themselves to be dramatically successful yet. Google’s core growth engine has been its search ads, but it’s also been known for its “Google X” labs, where it experiments on anything from network fiber to balloons and self-driving cars.\n\nAlphabet — through its CFO Ruth Porat — has been clear that it wants to be more judicious about the way it invests in these other bets. It’s all fine to invest in experimental projects like Fiber and self-driving cars, but if there isn’t a clear path to revenue, the company is going to have to figure out whether or not to move on to the next project and where to devote its resources. Alphabet may be one of the most valuable companies in the world, but even then it still only has so much runway and faces the constant threat from other companies emerging with experimental projects that could be runaway successes (the most obvious threat being the Amazon Echo).\n\nIf you wanted any evidence as to how absolutely tiny Google’s bets are for now, here’s a chart for you:\n\nGoogle saw the demand that Alexa tapped, and it is now looking to essentially smash Alexa — and Siri — with its own assistant powered by machine learning. And there’s a good bet it’ll work. Google has collected data for years and years on how people use the Internet, what kinds of questions they ask a search engine, and where they travel around after those questions have been asked. Google at a very fundamental level has a pretty good understanding of how we tick, and every time you use its services, it gets smarter and smarter. That’s why Google is constantly trying to bury its own interfaces within everything it does.\n\nSure, Google has a large portfolio of services that it can still throw ads up against. And that, at least for now, is something that can add a lot of value for its investors and keep the ship steady for a while. It has Gmail, with more than a billion users. It has one of the largest browsers in Chrome. In fact, it has a wide portfolio of services with a billion users or more. But those are not Google’s key revenue drivers, and Google has to show that it can keep growing revenue if it’s going to keep Wall Street off its back.\n\nThere’s a barrier that Google still has to overcome: while it is constantly learning, refining, improving and helping its users figure out what they are looking for, it also has to do so in a manner that doesn’t seem creepy. Google wants you to be constantly wired to the Internet — whether that’s through your phone, your voice or the way you move throughout the physical world. Google wants to tap your experience through everything from a screen to a virtual reality experience in the case of Daydream. And the company is aggressively spending in order to expand into all of those areas.\n\nApple still has an ace in the hole. It’s trying to roll out its own wireless earbuds that will give you Siri in your ear and, in theory, because of its proprietary technology it’ll be able to control the entire experience and make it uniquely Apple-y. Like Google, Apple is trying to figure out what kind of user experience looks like beyond the phone. Alexa and Google Home are in the living room, Google Assistant is talking to your phone, but the Airpods and Siri are a sort of wild card that we don’t know how it will play out yet.\n\nIn short, Google hasn’t cleared the way and gotten away from its existential crises. As long as those paid clicks keep going up, it’ll be able to keep the runway and hopefully figure out how to apply its strong machine learning capabilities to wherever users are drifting to next. And then once it gets people comfortable talking to, or clicking around, on their controlled user experience it can figure out how to monetize them the way it knows best — through advertisements.\n\nAlphabet’s opportunity is very big. For a moment earlier this year, Alphabet was the most valuable company in the world. In the face of slumping hardware sales, Apple clearly showed the risk that comes with focusing on a business beyond simply hardware, and that for growth it’s important to have a revenue base that exists as a collection of software and hardware. That’s what Google is looking for, with the unifying component being whatever search looks like after people are no longer using a search bar. And it’s a new story for Wall Street that just might work.\n\nFeatured Image: Jeff Chiu/AP" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1871553788401615 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.514947170381953 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-21T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

Now the technology, operated by a division of the company called Google Brain, touches nearly every piece of its business, including translation, photography and advertising.\n\n\"This revolution,\" Brin said, \"has been very profound and definitely surprised me even though I was right in there and could throw paper clips at them.\"\n\nBusiness leaders, politicians, economists and others attending the annual Davos retreat in the Swiss mountains have been debating the political and economic fallout from the globalization policies that conference attendees have long advocated.

Brin said technology's evolution is \"inherently chaotic\" and changes require debate about the proper ways for society to adjust.\n\n\"These are deep and powerful philosophical questions but I don't know that we're equipped to answer them,\" said Brin, adding that education should be more easily available.\n\nExpressing optimism, Brin said automation may allow people to take up more intellectually demanding, creative or artistic pursuits. \"Some of the more mundane tasks are alleviated through technology and people will find more and more creative and meaningful ways to spend their time,\" he said.\n\nStill, he cautioned that the future is impossible to predict. \"It's an incredible time and it's very hard to forecast what can these things do,\" he said. \"We don't really know the limits.\"\n\nBrin, who co-founded Google with Stanford classmate Larry Page in 1998, said it was his first trip to Davos in eight years.

(T) Stock Is “Easy Mode” for Investors" ], "article_text" : [ "Y’all may hate me for saying this, but AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ) is a boring company. Sure, every now and then, events spice things up. Recently, AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) have been eating crow over their attacks against T-Mobile US Inc (NASDAQ: TMUS ). VZ has received the brunt of T-Mobile’s counterpunches, but its CEO, John Legere, is no stranger to controversy. That’s likely to put T stock on the cover of a gossip magazine as it is on The Wall Street Journal.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBut for the most part, AT&T is a big hulking mass of old money. The drama surrounding VZ is entertaining to watch, and near-unanimous support by Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX ) shareholders of a proposed TWX-T merger is newsworthy.\n\nThen again, it’s sort of expected. Wake me up when the Department of Justice approves the deal.\n\nOn the flip side, T stock has proved it has still got some moves. Last year, T shares returned 30%. Compare that to the vaunted “FANG” stocks.\n\nOn average, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) combined for a little less than 12% in 2016. At the top of the FANG spectrum was AMZN, which turned in a performance just shy of 18%.\n\nSo there you have it — AT&T stock took down almighty Amazon.\n\nOf course, I’m being a bit facetious. If the market gods gave investors a freebie, I’d be shocked if anyone would choose AT&T stock. The reason is obvious. Every dog has its day, and 2016 just happened to be one of the good years for T stock. Back to planet Earth, in the three years between 2013 and the end of 2015, the company only managed a pedestrian 4.8% average.\n\nThe Math Looks Good for T stock\n\nDepending on your investment strategy, though, pedestrian just might do the trick. Here’s a good test to see if AT&T stock is right for you. If you’re still trying to figure out why your VCR flashes “12:00” all the time, congratulations! Mr. T is your right-hand man.\n\nI’m just half-joking here. InvestorPlace Contributor Lawrence Meyers rightfully declared that AT&T stock is a dividend behemoth. Indeed, he has no reservations, writing, “for this investor, buying AT&T stock is really just to get the 4.76% dividend.” I appreciate Meyers’ candor because it’s funny, and more importantly, he’s spot on.\n\nJust look at your cards. AT&T stock in its present form began trading towards the tail end of 1983. Lifetime, T stock is averaging returns of 12.7% — probably not what you were expecting. However, much of that growth occurred in its initial phase. Up to 1999, AT&T turned in 20.5%. From 2000 to the end of 2016, it’s a much more humble 4.8%.\n\nNow what do I always tell people?

Iyer, IFC Published : December 19, 2016\n\nGoogle Stock Outlook 2017\n\nMarkets have been on tenterhooks ever since Google morphed into Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG). Investors were confused about what it meant for GOOG stock, but everything is becoming clear. We can now say why it happened, and what it means for Google stock in 2017.\n\nBut before we go further, here’s a taste of what’s in store for the Google stock price in 2017:\n\nA new business segment potentially worth tens of billions of dollars. A new service that could be as popular as “Android.” A new device that could be bigger than the “iPhone.”\n\nEach of the above represents a “trigger point” for Google stock. When a new technology or product reaches its critical mass, the “trigger point” fires, propelling the share price skywards.\n\nYou’ll recognize it when you see it. One second there will be calm; the next, every two-bit investor is scrambling to buy the same stock. It’s herd mentality, plain and simple. The market is phenomenal at ignoring emerging technologies until the last possible moment.\n\nBut the moment those technologies become undeniable, investors become rabid.\n\nWe can lay out a time frame when these events could come to pass, but obviously trying to forecast the exact moment of a trigger point is a fool’s errand. No one has a magic 8-ball.\n\nAnyone who tells you that they know exactly when something will happen is either a liar or a fool.\n\nSteer clear of those charlatans. Think in terms of the next decade. What technologies are going to explode in popularity? Which company is best positioned to exploit that popularity? Once you know the answers to those questions, you can sit back and relax.\n\nThe rest happens like clockwork.\n\nLet me give you an example. In the fall of 2015, there was mounting excitement about new technologies like virtual reality (VR) and self-driving cars. A lot of analysts were bullish on the potential of these devices, as they should have been. Both technologies are going to be huge.\n\nBut most of them missed a crucial connection. Both driverless cars and VR devices had something in common: they both require advanced graphics cards. Self-driving cars need to understand the world around them, and that requires graphics cards.\n\nLikewise, VR needs to give you the impression of being submerged in a digital world. That also requires excellent graphics cards. We saw that connection. We understood its importance and, more to the point, we understood which company was best positioned to win that industry: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n\nSince that time, NVDA stock has tripled in value. It shot up 204% in the 12 months since we turned bullish on the graphics card maker. But here’s the best part: both driverless cars and VR haven’t reached their “trigger points” yet; these gains were just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nBut what does all this have to do with our Google stock forecast 2017? Let me explain…\n\n#1 “Trigger Point” for Google Stock Outlook 2017\n\nEarlier in this article, I mentioned—or rather hinted at—three trigger points which could send GOOG stock surging in 2017. I also mentioned two questions that needed answering:\n\nWhat technologies are going to explode in popularity over the next decade? Which company is best positioned to exploit that popularity?\n\nBased on extensive research (and conversations with industry insiders), we have identified three tech trends that are closing in on their “trigger points.”\n\nAs for the second question, the answer seems a little obvious. We clearly believe that Google stock will profit from these “trigger points,” or else we would have chosen a different stock to feature in this article.\n\nBut now let’s get into the details. The first of our three “trigger points” is an emerging technology trend which has slipped under the radar: Healthcare. I know what you’re thinking—what could a technology company do to impact the healthcare industry?\n\nAs it turns out, there’s a lot that a tech company can do for advancing diagnostic treatments. In this case, Google is making use of a company it acquired in 2014. The company, DeepMind Technologies Limited, was focused on “deep learning algorithms” and “neural networks.”\n\nYou may know those terms better by their more common name: Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nThere are a lot of companies hopping on the AI bandwagon, but Google has the cleverest strategy. It has embedded AI software into a range of healthcare apps that will help doctors detect diseases quicker and with greater accuracy. The potential for GOOG stock is amazing.\n\nImagine if you go in for a routine checkup at your doctor’s office. They do a few scans, the doctor barely glances at them, and then he sends you on your merry way. Fast forward a few years. You’re in for another routine physical, but this time they diagnose you with acute kidney injury.\n\nEven with the best doctors that money can buy, there’s no guarantee that anyone could have predicted your affliction. So it’s not exactly the doctor’s fault. But that doesn’t help your situation.\n\nGoogle thinks that artificial intelligence (AI)—or “deep learning algorithms,” to be more accurate—can help solve this problem. Its app basically churns through millions of kidney scans. Eventually it begins to understand how the disease evolves, which helps predict diseases earlier on.\n\nDoes it sound too good to be true? Well, apparently the National Health Service in the U.K. doesn’t think so. It is already using the app to catch early acute kidney injury. (Source: “NHS to use Google DeepMind AI app to help treat patients,” Engadget, November 22, 2016.)\n\nIt was a relatively small piece of news, so it hasn’t seeped into the Google stock price yet. However, the additional revenue from healthcare institutions could send GOOG stock skyrocketing in 2017.\n\nThe “trigger point” is all that’s left.\n\n#2 “Trigger Point” for Google Stock Outlook 2017\n\nThe second major catalyst for Google stock is self-driving cars. Autonomous vehicles. Driverless tech. Whatever you call it, this trend is fast approaching its “trigger point.” Just look at the search traffic for the keyword “autonomous car”:\n\nChart courtesy of Google Trends\n\nAs you can see, interest in self-driving technology jumped dramatically over the last five years. This isn’t an accident. Companies like Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Uber Technologies, Inc. have made some high-profile investments into driverless technology.\n\nBut they weren’t the first. Google was the real pioneer of self-driving technology.\n\nMore to the point, Google is in a better position to win than Tesla or Uber. Rather than spending a bunch of cash on building cars. Google is just licensing the tech to existing manufacturers, much like it did with the Android operating system. (Source: “Google and Fiat agree to build a driverless minivan,” The Telegraph, May 3, 2016.)\n\nWhen the smartphone wars reached their peak, Google didn’t just try to build its own hardware. It developed an open-source platform that other manufacturers could build on top of. It was a brilliant move that paid huge dividends. GOOG stock price has more than doubled since.\n\nLikewise, big automakers—like Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) and Toyota Motor Corp (ADR) (NYSE:TM)—have already agreed to license driverless tech from Google.\n\nBased on the success of Android, Google stock could be in for a huge tailwind once driverless tech has its “trigger point.” That scratches number two off our list, leaving us with one more “trigger point” to explore.\n\n#3 “Trigger Point” for Google Stock Outlook 2017\n\nVirtual reality is the third and final “trigger point” for GOOG stock. The technology is inching its way towards critical mass but, at present, only hardcore gamers and tech junkies have bought a VR system. That could soon change, much to the benefit of Google stock price.\n\nOlder and less tech-savvy consumers aren’t familiar with VR. To many of them, it sounds like science fiction. But rest assured that VR devices aren’t a thing of the distant future—they are available through Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and in Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) stores around the country.\n\nYou can strap on one of these headsets and fall into another world. As someone who owns a VR headset, take it from me: this device is phenomenal. It is like nothing else you have ever experienced, which is why Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) estimates a potential market size at $80.0 billion.\n\nMy only complaint is the limited amount of content.\n\nThink about it: customers aren’t willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for a device when there are only a handful of games or movies to watch. They’d rather wait until more content is developed.\n\nThe good news is they won’t have to wait long. Production studios are tripping over each other to establish a foothold in the VR market. All of them know that VR devices could be bigger than the iPhone was in its heyday, so they experimented with new “VR experiences.”\n\nGoogle is taking full advantage of its monstrous size in the VR world. Its first product was an inexpensive VR headset called “Cardboard.” It was exactly what it sounds like: a cardboard foldout headset that you put together and attach to your smartphone. It cost only $20.00.\n\nUnlike its competitors, Google knew that customers were skittish about VR. So it gave them a low-risk option with “Cardboard.” If customers didn’t take well to VR, big deal. What’s $20.00 in the grand scheme of things? By contrast, competitors were selling VR gear for $600.00 to $1,600.\n\nBut excitement for VR is building. The technology is speeding toward its “trigger point” and Google knows it. In response to renewed interest in VR, the company has unveiled the “Daydream,” a high-quality VR viewer.\n\nGranted, at $100.00 per unit, Daydream is more expensive than Cardboard, but customers are more familiar with VR now. They have access to more content and improved quality, so it makes sense for them to shell out the cash.\n\nMoreover, this makes sense from a business standpoint. Google is ramping up its product offerings alongside the VR trend. This way, GOOG stock could be perfectly positioned when VR has its “trigger point.”\n\nIn summary: Google stock is on the cusp of extraordinary gains. This stock has already gleaned enormous returns for investors, but VR, autonomous cars, and AI could send GOOG stock soaring in 2017.", "In addition to being omnipresent in the online search world, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has found another way of being useful in an individual's daily life. Early last month, the tech giant launched the Google Home product with aims to serve as a voice-activated speaker powered by the company’s Google Assistant.\n\nRecently, Google Home also added a few more actions into its home assistant’s arsenal.\n\n(Google)\n\nEarnings performance\n\nOn Oct. 27, Alphabet delivered its third quarter fiscal 2016 results. The tech giant delivered strong 19.7% sales growth to $64.2 billion and 23.8% profit growth to $14.1 billion nine months into its fiscal 2016 operations. This an amazing level of profitability considering that Alphabet’s operational expenses grew by 18.8% in the period.\n\n“We had a great third quarter, with 20% revenue growth year on year, and 23% on a constant currency basis. Mobile search and video are powering our core advertising business and we’re excited about the progress of newer businesses in Google and Other Bets,” said Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet’s shares remained almost flat, or 0.27% the following day, while the broader Standard & Poor 500 index closed down by 0.31%.\n\nValuations\n\nAccording to GuruFocus data, Alphabet’s class A shares had a trailing 12-month PE ratio of 29.6 times (higher than 50% of its peers), PB ratio of 4 times (lower than 61% of its peers) and PS ratio of 6.59 times (lower than 79% of its peers). The company does not provide dividends.\n\nMarket performance\n\nAlphabet underperformed the market year-to-date with 4% versus 12.8%. Meanwhile, the company’s class A shares outperformed the market with 17% total return versus 15.56% on a five-year total return basis.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet was founded in October 2015 and serves as a parent company of Google. In its filing, Alphabet is a collection of businesses, of which the largest is Google. The company also includes businesses that combine as Other Bets, such as the Verily, Calico, X, Nest, GV, Google Capital and Access/Google Fiber.\n\nAlphabet generates its revenues mostly by delivering cost-effective and relevant online advertising to its consumers. Alphabet generated 90%, or $67 billion, of its total Google segment revenues from advertising in fiscal 2015.\n\nAlphabet derived most of its business from the U.S., at 46% of the company’s total 2015 sales. Google's core products such as Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Google Play and Gmail each have over one billion monthly active users. These core business operations by Alphabet are immensely admirable as it could possibly produce a bottomless cash flow.\n\n(Research and development expenditures, 10-K and 10-Q)\n\nAlphabet, nonetheless, guarantees its shareholders that it will not become complacent and rest on its laurels. The company dedicates a huge amount of its sales in research and development expenditures alone, $12.3 billion or 16% of its gross sales in fiscal 2015.\n\nAlphabet has two reported segments: Google and Other Bets.\n\n(10-Q and 10-K)\n\nGoogle\n\nThe Google segment includes Alphabet’s main internet products such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Apps, Cloud, Android, Chrome and Google Play. The Google segment also includes hardware products the company sells, such as Chromecast, Chromebooks, Nexus and the recently launched Virtual Reality products.\n\nIn 2015, the Google segment grew 13.5% to $74.5 billion and delivered an operating margin of 31.4%. Nine months into fiscal 2016, the segment grew 19.3% year-on-year and had remarkably the same margin as the previous year.\n\nOther Bets\n\nAccording to Alphabet, the Other Bets segment is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Other Bets includes businesses such as Access/Google Fiber, Calico, Nest, Verily, GV, Google Capital, X and other initiatives.\n\nIn 2015, Other Bets segment grew 37% to $448 million and delivered an operating loss of $3.57 billion, markedly several times greater than the revenue it generated. Nine months into fiscal 2016, the segment grew 85.4% and delivered an operating loss of $2.5 billion, compared to $2.25 billion the year before.\n\nOverall, Alphabet had five-year sales and profit growth averages of 20.7% and 13.96%, respectively.\n\nOwnership\n\nAlphabet has three different classes of shares, class A, B and C. The company’s class A common stock, or ticker GOOGL, has one vote per share, class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and class C capital stock, ticker GOOG, has no voting rights.\n\nAs of December 2015, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt owned approximately 92.5% of Alphabet’s outstanding Class B common stock, which translated into a 58.5% combined voting power in the company.\n\n(CNN Money)\n\nAs observed, there has been a minimal deviation in either the class A or class C share price over time.\n\nCash, debt and book value\n\nAs of Sept. 30, Alphabet had $83 billion in cash and $3.9 billion in debt, indicating a debt-equity ratio of 0.03. Alphabet also had 12% of its $159.9 billion assets in goodwill and intangibles with a book value of $134.1 billion, compared to $120.3 billion in December 2015.\n\nCash flow\n\n(10-Q)\n\nAlphabet also achieved a 33.4% cash flow from operations growth to $26.6 billion in its recent nine months of operations. Though brought mostly by its incredible profit growth, the company had a 27.7% increase in depreciation and impairment of its property and 28.9% increase in stock-based compensation expense. Also, Alphabet had a 97% increase in its income taxes cash flow.\n\nCapital expenditures for the online search giant were $7.1 billion, leaving the company with $19.5 billion in free cash flow, compared to $12.1 billion last year.\n\n(10-Q and 10-K filings)\n\nIn October 2015, Alphabet initiated a $5 billion share repurchase program. The repurchase program ended in June 2016 with 5.2 million Alphabet class C repurchased amounting to $3.7 billion, or 18.9% of its free cash flow in the recent nine months of operations.\n\nIn October 2016, Alphabet again decided to perform another share repurchase program, this time with a $7 billion target.\n\nIn addition to the recent buyback activities, Alphabet has been consistently able to allocate huge amounts of cash flow in marketable securities. In the most recent nine months, the company placed $71 billion of its cash flow in assets. Alphabet had about 44%, or $32.4 billion, invested in the U.S. Government notes; 17.1% invested in agency mortgage-backed securities and 20.5% invested in corporate debt securities.\n\nThe company also had a positive $54.4 billion in maturities and sales of its marketable securities for the period compared to $46.9 billion last year.\n\nConclusion\n\nSome months ago, I completely ignored Google secondary to its valuations without even trying to understand its business. This time around, I have gotten to know the company better and the company does deserve some market (price) appreciation brought by its compelling visionary qualities and the established business model to produce the money to support these ideas.\n\nArticles describing how most dollar advertising spent online are earned by just both Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) only describes how both companies have developed such moats overtime. Facebook was founded in 2004, while Google was founded in 1998.\n\nThere is no doubt that Alphabet wants to return most of its bountiful cash flow to its shareholders by its recent share repurchase programs.\n\n(Google Finance)\n\nAnalysts at Mizuho and RBC Capital Mkts both ranked Alphabet’s shares as a buy and outperform, respectively, and see a target price of $1,025 per share.\n\nHaving Alphabet’s share price touch new highs in recent months, it would probably be safe to say that the company’s shares are a speculative buy with at least a $1,000 share price target.\n\n--\n\nGoogle is the third of the four companies in the widely known FANG stocks I have reviewed.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock benefits from business diversification, continued innovation, increasing opex control, and a favorable valuation. However, Canaccord Genuity believes the single most important short-term metric is Websites revenue growth. In 2015, this metric accelerated from 13% to 20% and has remained above that point throughout 2016. Mobile search and YouTube are the two primary drivers of this, and Canaccord believes this dynamic has not run its course just yet.\n\nAdditionally, other parts of the non-core business (including Play, Cloud, and programmatic), should provide growth tailwinds beyond 2017. Canaccord continues to believe revenue growth can stay high, margins can expand modestly, and valuation has room to grow owing to multiple expansion. In the possible event that revenue growth slows to the low-double-digit range, Canaccord believes the earnings multiple can expand based on examining the long history of MSFT stock during a similar, multi-year transition.\n\nCanaccord believes the most important positive over the past 18 months has been the re-acceleration of Websites revenue growth, which progressed from 13% in Q2/15 to 16% in Q3 and 20% in Q4. It has stayed well above 20% so far this year and is an important psychological level for the stock. Despite lapping the addition of a third mobile search ad unit last quarter, Canaccord believes further innovations will extend growth, including tests of a fourth mobile ad unit and more robust adoption of PLAs.\n\nQualitatively, Canaccord observed that ad load expanded dramatically in 2015-2016. Canaccord also started noticing that skippable ads were being replaced by non-skippable more often. Quantitatively, Canaccord counts over 15 innovations and announcements for the YouTube service over the last two years. Canaccord believes this non-core unit is getting considerable attention in order to capture even more spend from TV. Original and licensed content is also increasing on the platform, which should help viewing time expand.\n\nIn addition to becoming more equity shareholder friendly, the management team is also beginning to rein in costs from “moonshot” projects. Google Fiber has had mixed results in some cities and higher-than-expected costs in others. It is reportedly cutting 9% of its workforce and pausing or ending operations in 10 cities where not fully deployed.

The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $839.65, down from yesterday’s close by -1.19%. Given the stock’s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company’s recent data.\n\nFundamental Analysis\n\nMoney managers are always interested in a company that can find the right recipe of fundamental data because it reflects something important going on underneath the surface. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) currently trades with a market capitalization of $573.79 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 22.20 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report.\n\nThe balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For GOOGL, the company currently has $12.78 Billion of cash on the books. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $25.83 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to grow in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $7.2 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 0.35% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nWe’ve taken a serious look at this stock from a fundamental perspective, but the tale of the tape may offer more hints about what lies under the surface. Looking at the stock’s movement on the chart, Alphabet Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $874.42. It is now trading 34.77% off that level. The stock is trading $843.44 its 50-day moving average by 3.7900000000001%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $672.66.\n\nIn recent action, Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) has made a move of -1.33% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 4.45, and it’s gotten there by action that has been less volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 0.50% with $602.60 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of GOOGL." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.03878174603174604 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4125873015873016 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-24T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

While it was a surprise to many, we profited from seeing it coming. Just recently, I wrote several strategies to go long AAPL stock, and they have all paid well and without trouble.\n\nTwelve days ago, I wrote about how you can profit from owning AAPL or trading it. This was in addition to last month’s $5 profit per contract out of thin air trading Apple stock when it had appeared to be too late.\n\nToday, I want to repeat the success I’ve had trading AAPL stock long. But this time I am doing it in a smaller account, so I will use credit put spreads instead of selling naked puts.\n\nHow to Trade AAPL Stock\n\nThe Bet: Sell the AAPL Oct $110/$105 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 55 cents per contract to open. The 20% buffer from current price gives me a 90% theoretical chance of success. If Apple shares stay above $110 per share, the trade will yield 12% on money risk.\n\nUsually I like to balance my trades by selling opposite bearish risk, but in this case I will refrain. I will count on the Warren Buffett effect that long-term AAPL is a hold. Buyers should step in on down weeks and defend the stock for me.\n\nI could sell credit call spreads in the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQ ) to create some balance, but I don’t feel it’s necessary at this time.\n\nEarlier, I noted that I like selling naked puts in sure things like AAPL and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). So I will offer the trade, but I only do this if I am willing and able to own the stock at the strike sold.\n\nThe Alternate: Sell the AAPL Oct $105 put naked. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.25 per contract to open. My breakeven point is $103.75 per share. Anything lower would accrue losses for me.\n\nIf AAPL stock falls below my sold strike, I would be put the stock at that price even if it’s much lower. Therein lies the open-ended risk unlike that of a credit put spread.\n\nI am not required to hold trades through expiration. I can close either of them for partial gains or losses at any time.\n\nNicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

The road to success is fraught with hazards and the potential reward is huge. Apple has built one of the strongest brands in history, turning electronic devices into status symbols through their brilliant marketing, design aesthetic, and reputation for dependability.Now they will put their brand and technology prowess to the test as they plunge into the market of the world's most recognized status symbol: The Luxury Automobile.Their brand and a substantial portion of their $750 billion market cap hangs in the balance.We start by capturing what is publicly known or widely believed about the Apple Car project, code-named \"Titan\":The automotive industry is one of the world's largest markets, with luxury cars alone accounting for $360 billion per year in sales and growing fast:The electric vehicle market weighed in at over $80 billion in 2012 and is projected to hit greater than $270 billion by 2019:The world's largest vehicle producer is, surprisingly to American car owners, Volkswagen, with global sales of over 200 billion euros per year, followed closely by Toyota (source: Statista). Put in perspective, Volkswagen has roughly the same total revenue as Apple's $240 billion USD. A successful launch for Apple could realistically double revenues, and with time, operating margins and substantial new profits would be sure to follow.The risk to Apple's brand if the car launch is unsuccessful is enormous. In 2010 an antenna problem with the iPhone 4 was a recoverable embarrassment. In the automotive realm, any mishap could have dire consequences. When Tesla was a little known startup with grand ideas, they were able to survive several batteries catching fire. Serious, potentially dangerous problems with the Apple Car would likely have far broader implications with down-stream effects across the Apple ecosystem.The most obvious competition comes from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), which is a company that created an unbelievably strong brand. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will have to grapple with the reality that in the automotive space, there is a brand that is tied to technology that is going to be a burden to overcome, even for the mighty mac maker.The competition also sprawls into the makers of the brain of a self-driving car -- and that means Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo.For the longest time this project felt like one of the many moonshots that would never really see the light of day - that's what Wall Street would have had us think, at least. But it isn't a moonshot, it's a business - and a rather large one.No company is better positioned to make a huge technological investment, backed by a brilliant marketing campaign, and championed by a beloved brand, than Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). If Apple succeeds in releasing its car, they are likely to not only reap enormous financial rewards, but also to massively swell the size of the electric vehicle market and, in so doing, create a permanent shift to a new era of automotive history.And, now we know -- people want an Apple Car -- and they want it more than anything else the company can deliver.The author is long shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the time of this writing." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.05956790123456789, 0.1909654581529582 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3852623456790124, 0.5665724707391372 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-02-28T15:26:51.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-02-27T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

The case has been filed with the California Superior Court in San Francisco.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Google has a spying program in place which instructs employees to keep and eye out for employees who seem like they'd be leaking information out of the company. It gets even more interesting. Google also has a policy in place which disallows employees from reporting any illegal activities happening within the company, even to Google's attorneys. Moreover, Google employees also cannot write about working in the Silicon Valley company without getting permission from the enterprise.\n\nThe scope of the policies is also very all-encompassing which makes it all the more riskier for employees. The suit details that \"everything at Google\" is classified as confidential by the policies and violating them leads directly to termination. Due to this, employees are unable to reveal anything about their workplace to anyone outside of the company, be it their partner or family.\n\nThe suit noted Google being guilty of 12 violations of the laws, and if the company is found guilty on all counts, then the payout could reach up to $3.8 billion. Out of this figure, 75% would directly go to the state for the penalty and the rest would be shared between Google's 65,00 employees. This would come out to a hefty sum of $14,500 per employee.

The agreements define confidential information as \"without limitation, any information in any form that relates to Google or Google's business that is not generally known,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit says the agreements violate state laws that provide that employers cannot bar workers from discussing their wages or disclosing information to government agencies.\n\nA spokesperson for Mountain View, California-based Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, said in a statement that the claims were \"baseless,\" and said the agreements were designed to protect sensitive business information and not to bar employees from discussing working conditions.\n\n\"We're very committed to an open internal culture, which means we frequently share with employees details of product launches and confidential business information,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nGoogle is facing similar claims from an unidentified employee in proceedings before the U.S. National Labor Relations Board, which recently struck down confidentiality agreements and other employment contracts that could discourage workers from discussing concerns at T-Mobile USA Inc, DirectTV and a number of other companies.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the plaintiff says that to enforce its policies, Google forces workers to spy on each other through a program called \"Stopleaks\" that requires them to report the disclosure of confidential information. Employees can be fired or sued for violating employment agreements or failing to report leaks, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"Google continues to insist that Googlers refrain from plainly communicating with others that Google is violating the law or endangering consumers,\" the complaint says.\n\nPlaintiffs in court cases are rarely allowed to proceed anonymously absent extraordinary circumstances. The Google worker says that being identified could harm his reputation at the company and his future job prospects.\n\nThe plaintiff is seeking to represent all current and former Google employees who signed the agreements.

That represents a 10-fold increase since 2012, according to YouTube, when it started building algorithms that analyse user data to give each user personalized video lineups designed to keep them watching longer. Believe it or not, 400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube each minute, or 65 years of video a day. YouTube benefits from the enormous reach of Google, which handles over 93% of internet searches. Google embeds YouTube videos in search results and pre-installs the YouTube app on its Android software, which is running on over 88% of smartphones.\n\nSurprisingly, since Google parent Alphabet Inc doesn’t break out YouTube’s performance, it is still unclear if YouTube is profitable. Some analysts estimate it took in about $US4 billion in ad revenue in 2014 (YouTube makes most of its money on running ads before videos) and roughly broke even. However, given the subscriber growth since then and assuming Google hasn’t overspent on technology and rights to content, YouTube should underpin the company’s growth going forward. About 2 billion unique users now watch a YouTube video every 90 days, according to industry specialists.\n\nAlphabet is in Macrovue’s Tech Stars Vue and Social Media Vue.\n\nAnother Week – More Record Highs\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 21,000 mark for the first time, gaining 183.95, or 0.9%, to close the week at 21,005.71—its fourth straight weekly gain. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 0.7%, to 2383.12, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4%, to 5870.75; both have been up for six straight weeks. A more conciliatory and “presidential” speech from Mr. Trump and generally positive economic data from around the globe were the main drivers of last week’s market rally.\n\nSnap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) IPO\n\nSnap Inc shares surged on their first day of trading Thursday as investors clamoured for shares of the biggest technology initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S. since Alibaba Group (BABA:NYSE) made its debut in 2014. Shares of Snap opened at $24, above the IPO price of $17, and recently traded up to US$27.09 on Friday. That’s a 59% gain over the offer price.\n\nThe investment case for Snap rests on its vast audience of 158 million daily users (DAUs) in the fourth quarter, concentrated in the coveted 18-to-34-year-old demographic. Snapchat has also won millions of teen users. Certainly the site has attracted advertisers who want to reach that younger audience.\n\nFundamentally, Snap comes to market with a few “warts”. The company lost more than $500 million as it spent heavily on data storage and marketing and research. Snap must quickly monetize its advertising business in order to support its rich valuation and approach its near term target of $1 billion in revenue. In 2016, the company posted revenue of $404.5 million, up nearly sevenfold compared to 2015-revenue. Not surprisingly, the Wall Street analysts who follow the company have an average target price of US$16.50 or slightly less than the issue price!\n\nThe Week Ahead\n\nChina Numbers\n\nThe Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and National People’s Congress (NPC) meetings will wrap up. Analysts expect the 2017 GDP goal unchanged at +6.5-7%. The fiscal deficit target will likely be raised from 3% in 2016 to 3.5% for 2017. The market expects the inflation target will remain unchanged at 3%, and the money supply (M2) growth target will be lowered to 12% (vs. 13% last year). There are also a few February economic numbers to be released in China (including FX reserves morning of Tuesday 7th March, imports/exports Wednesday 8th March, and CPI/PPI morning of Thursday 9th March).\n\nEuropean Central Bank Meeting\n\nThe ECB meeting on Thursday 9th March should be relatively uneventful, with officials likely to push back further against rising expectations for a tightening in policy.\n\nUS Numbers\n\nIn the US, the February jobs report released on Friday 10th March will be the last major economic data point before the 15th March Federal Open Market Committee decision. Certainly the jobs report could prove pivotal for the Fed as it decides whether to hike rates on 15th March or later. Economists are modelling total job adds of ~175K (vs. 227K in Jan). For what it’s worth, Federal-funds futures contracts say there’s a 94% probability that the central bank will lift its key interest rate target by 25 basis points (one-quarter of a percentage point), to 0.75% to 1%." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.09628035008469793 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3795407491059665 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-07T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

It’s the biggest cloud-services provider, with data centers around the world that handle the computing power for many large companies, such as Netflix Inc. and Capital One Corp. Amazon and competitors Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. are growing their cloud computing businesses as customers find it more efficient to shift their data storage and computer functions to the cloud rather than maintaining those functions on their own. The shift also increases the likelihood that problems with one service can have sweeping ramifications online.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world.

There is too much data and too many connected devices even today, not to speak of the absurdity that is to come, to not have a machine learning driven technology to balance the needs of every website, every app, all the data in complete harmony. Enter the cloud.\n\nThe worldwide public cloud market is forecast to rise from $154 billion this year to nearly half a trillion dollars by 2026. Right now, there are two distinct leaders. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the undisputed leader and right behind the e-commerce giant is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Here is a market share chart:\n\n(Source: SkyHighNetworks.com)\n\nWhile the mainstream media will talk about the battle between Amazon.com and Microsoft Corporation, the third place company is none other than Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and while trailing, let us never forget that it is the second largest company in the world, it relies heavily on its search advertising business, and it is getting aggressive about diversifying that revenue stream and that could be a serious risk to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nALPHABET INC\n\nWhile digital advertising is the kingpin in Google's empire, the segment is finally showing slowing growth as echoed by both Alphabet Inc and Facebook. Even further, Google's search revenue is seeing increased competition from mobile search.\n\nAdd to that the very clear intentions of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) with its voice activated Siri, and we have the makings of trouble. But, of course, Alphabet Inc is ahead of the curve, not behind it.\n\nQuietly Google has submitted some of the most impressive, if not bizarre, patent filings with respect to data hosting and the cloud. Here is one rendering:\n\nGoogle may be taking the technology behind cloud computing to the absolute ends of human knowledge. Another under reported story revealed that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) moved half a billion dollars of business away from Amazon.com's cloud (AWS) to Google last year in what we assume is the beginning of a competitive stance that Apple will take by entering the cloud business itself.\n\nNow that Alphabet has broken out a segment of the company that is dedicated to the growing needs of the cloud called \"The Google Cloud,\" the company's intentions are rather clear.\n\nANALYTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING\n\nIn 2015, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) brought in the co-founder of VMware, Diane Greene, to head its cloud segment. She recently spoke at a Goldman Sachs conference and said this:\n\nThe enterprise has to lean into data and that's what Google was built for. With machine learning and data analytics, we're in the sweet spot of where enterprise customers are going.\n\nWhile Wall Street has bemoaned Alphabet Inc's late entry and their apparent lack of a competitive advantage to AMZN and MSFT, when taken as a holistic entity, we could argue that there is no company better suited to deliver unparalleled analytics and there is certainly an argument that no company has done as much as quickly as Alphabet Inc has done with machine learning and artificial intelligence, save for chip marvel Nvidia.\n\nWith Amazon pulling about 60% of its operating income from its cloud business, even though it makes up less than 10% of revenue, the cloud war is going to be a critical one.\n\nA BETTER BET\n\nAs the tech titans war over the cloud business, and that includes what feels like an inevitable entry by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), there's another way to play this thematic revolution in technology. Behind every cloud, every connected computer, is a routing and switching system. It sounds boring, but this is the business that Cisco has turned into a $150 billion market cap.\n\nBut there's a new player -- a young, sparkling technology company that just crossed $1 billion in revenue, and this company is the pick-axe to the cloud computing gold rush. In all the haste to pick a cloud winner, don't forget the company that aims to power every cloud, irrespective of the tech giant that owns it.\n\nThe author is long shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and has no position in Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\nIf the kind of research we touched on with the cloud grabs your attention, then what we offer may be up your alley: Our research sits side-by-side with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, JP Morgan, and the rest on professional terminals as a part of the famed Thomson First Call group. We do this research several times a week and we also have a list of spotlight companies.

We'll detail it below -- but that's the lede -- the option market is reflecting a sort of risk malaise, for now, an IV30 ofverus the IV30 of the S&P 500 at. The annual high for Alphabet Inc IV30 is-- and we're below that level. Thehere is low vol.One thing to note beyond the risk malaise alert, which we cover in the article, is that while implied volatility may be low, the real question that needs to be answered for option sellers is, but ratherTo skip ahead of this risk alert and see if buying or selling options has been a winner in Alphabet Inc, you can go here: Geting serious about option trading This is a proprietary risk rating and risk alert system that looks forward for the next month -- or really 30 days to be exact -- and that. The system is based on multiple interactions of data points, many of which come directly from the option market for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) . The creator of this model is Capital Market Laboratories (CMLviz.com).In the \"Why This Matters\" sectionon Alphabet Inc we're going to take a step back and show in great specificity that there is actuallyin successful option trading than many people know. The whole concept of an \"option trading expert\" is vastly over complicated and we'll talk about how superior returns are earned.But first, let's turn back to GOOGL and the company's risk rating:We also take a peek at the implied vol for the Technology ETF (XLK), our broad based proxy for GOOGL.\n\nS&P 500 IV30 11.33% Nasdaq 100 IV30 11.39% XLK IV30 11.94% GOOGL HV 30 10.11% GOOGL Current IV30 19.8% 52 Week Low IV30 10.62% 52 Week High IV30 30.95%\n\nGOOGL\n\nCurrent IV30 GOOGL\n\nLow IV30 GOOGL\n\nHigh IV30 19.8% 10.6% 31.0%\n\nThe risk as reflected by the option market has hit a collapsing low relative to the company's past. The option market reflects a 95% confidence interval stock price range of ($802.60, $878.70) within the next 30 calendar days.While the option market risk rating is on the low side, we note that companies in this situation are still susceptible to sudden stock move risk, it's simply theof that large stock move is depressed. Buyers of options and volatility may find these prices more attractive than at other times.The IV30® is the risk reflected by the option market in the stock price for the next 30 calendar days -- it's forward looking. Alphabet Inc shows an IV30 of 19.8%, which is a collapsing low for the company relative to its past.The option market for GOOGL has shown an IV30 annual low of 10.6% and an annual high of 31.0%, meaning that GOOGL is at the 45% percentile right now.

However, a multitude of factors affect the ROE, which is unequivocally the most popular profitability ratio, and digging through them in detail is a must before arriving at any conclusion. View our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nBreaking down ROE — the mother of all ratios\n\nROE is one of the most popular ratios to calculate the profitability of a company. The ratio is arrived by putting net earnings in the numerator and shareholders’ equity in the denominator. Generally, an ROE of 20% or more is considered highly attractive for any investment consideration. Although, it’s more of an industry-specific ratio as the constituents share similar risk profile.\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit ÷ Shareholders Equity\n\nNo matter how high or low return a company generates on equity, it should be more than the cost of equity for value creation. For GOOGL, the cost of equity estimate comes at 10.92% based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model using the current risk free rate and a levered beta to account for financial leverage. That compares to Alphabet’s 15.2% ROE.\n\n\n\nROE can be broken down into three ratios using the Dupont formula. The profit margin is the income as a percentage of sales, while asset turnover highlights how efficiently a company is using the resources at its disposal. Increased leverage, primarily through raising debt, is good for a profitable company, but only to the extent it doesn’t make the firm insolvent in a time of crisis.\n\nDupont Formula ROE = annual net profit ÷ shareholders’ equity ROE = (annual net profit ÷ sales) × (sales ÷ assets) × (assets ÷ shareholders’ equity) ROE = profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverage\n\nA reflection of how net profit margin has affected ROE in the past can be seen in the trend of income and revenue. An investor can gauge a fair estimate of how it’s going to play out in the future by looking at the analysts’ forecasts in the years ahead. Alphabet’s ROA over the past 12 months stood at 9.2% versus the industry’s 8.94%. Although an investor should look at multi-year asset turnover to assess its effect on the latest ROE, a quick comparison with the industry tells him whether it’s acceptable. We use ROA for the comparison as along with sales, used in asset turnover, earnings, used in ROA, are also comparable within the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last but not the least is the financial leverage. It’s an important ratio as a company can hide its poor operating and asset-use efficiency by increasing leverage. Thus, along with ROE, we should look at the Return on capital, which reflects earnings as a percentage of overall capital employed, including debt. For GOOGL, ROC stood at 16% versus the industry’s 6.78%.\n\nROE – It’s not just another ratio\n\nROE is called the mother of all ratios for a reason. It helps gauge a company’s efficiency both through the income statement and the balance sheet, along with telling you how just changing the capital structure of the company can impact perceived return.

(GOOGL), General Dynamics Corporation (GD)" ], "article_text" : [ "Shares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are on a recovery track as they have regained 24.66% since bottoming out at $672.66 on Jun. 27, 2016. Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost -3.39% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 5.81% so far on the year — still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -4.11% from $874.42 , the 52-week high touched on Mar. 17, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 11.31% for the past 12 months.\n\nBrokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to buy Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)’s shares projecting a $987.88 target price. What do this target means? Price targets reflect what the analyst believes a stock will be worth four quarters into the future. Are investors supposed to sell when the stock hits the target? Price targets frequently change, depending on the outlook for a company’s earnings. Sometimes it may seem like it, but analysts don’t just pull their price targets out of thin air. Typically, they estimate what the company’s earnings and cash flow will be for the next couple of years, and then apply a ratio – such as a price-to-earnings ratio – to those estimates to determine what the future stock price should theoretically be.\n\nGOOGL’s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 19% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 22.2% looks attractive.\n\nWhile there are a number of profitability ratios that measure a company’s ability to generate profit from the sales or services it provides, one of the most important is the net profit margin. It tells us what percentage of revenue a company keeps after all its bills are paid. While the higher this number is, the better, there is no gold standard. That’s why this number shouldn’t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company’s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, Alphabet Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at 21.58%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 16.64%, and the sector’s average is 4.7%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector.\n\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -4.39% since hitting a peak level of $194 on Mar. 17, 2017. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -2.18% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 7.9% so far on the year — still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 46.83% higher from $128.99, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Mar. 28, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 21.72% for the past six months.\n\nThe good news is there’s still room for the share price to grow. At recent closing price of $185.49, GD has a chance to add $17.57 or 9.47% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($203.06) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 1.9 looks like a buy. It has a 36-month beta of 0.77 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride.\n\nFor the past 5 years, General Dynamics Corporation’s EPS growth has been nearly 7.3%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 9.22%, annually.\n\nTwo other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company’s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company’s ability to turn an investor’s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders’ behalf. General Dynamics Corporation’s ROE is 28.2%, while industry’s is 11.9%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 8.9%.\n\nReturn on assets, on the other hand, measures a company’s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets. GD’s ROA is 9.44%, while industry’s average is 1.06%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 4.35." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.06465067340067339 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4389688552188551 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-28T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

Iyer, IFC Published : December 8, 2016\n\nEnergy Independence for Google Stock?\n\nAs we inch closer to the end of 2016, companies are starting to release their big plans for next year. As always, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) had something memorable to add: namely that it will meet 100% of its green energy requirements in 2017.\n\nThis should add an interesting new dimension to Google stock (GOOG), at least for those who are worried about climate change. Having a corporate entity—one of the biggest in the world—behave with social awareness is not something we see every day. (Source: “We’re set to reach 100% renewable energy — and it’s just the beginning,” Google Blog, December 6, 2016.)\n\n“[We are] the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable power,” wrote Google Senior Vice President Urs Hölzle in a blog post announcing the news. He added that Google now plans to “[directly buy] enough wind and solar electricity annually to account for every unit of electricity our operations consume, globally.”\n\nHowever, this doesn’t mean that solar panels are going to be plastered to Google’s rooftops. The company is too large an organisation to simply “move off the grid.” Instead, it chooses to buy all its green energy from renewable sources, even if that means going through a traditional utility.\n\nFor instance, if a green energy company decides to set up a big farm of solar panels, rather than sell to end consumers, it signs a contract with utility companies. The solar farms feed the green energy onto the grid, which can then be purchased by companies like Google.\n\nUtilizing these third-party sources is an important step for Google stock. Like its competitors at Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM), Google is building new data centers across the world. The existing data centers use three percent of the world’s electricity; a number that is expected to triple once these companies are done expanding.\n\nIn other words, tech companies will be consuming roughly 10% of the world’s energy supply just to power data centers. The energy demands will be extraordinary, but they have made public assurances that most of the energy will come from renewable sources.\n\n“The science tells us that tackling climate change is an urgent global priority,” Hölzle wrote. “We believe the private sector, in partnership with policy leaders, must take bold steps and that we can do so in a way that leads to growth and opportunity. And we have a responsibility to do so — to our users and the environment.”\n\nGoogle stock (GOOG) was up 1.35% at the time of writing, hovering at $769.22.", "The world's leading internet services company is again expanding its climate and clean energy commitments, announcing yesterday that by 2017 it will meet 100 percent of its corporate energy demand with carbon-free energy.\n\nAlphabet Inc.'s Google, whose physical headquarters is in Mountain View, Calif., but whose digital footprint extends across the globe, said it now has commitments to purchase 2.6 gigawatts of electricity under long-term contracts with renewable energy providers. That's up from 2 GW a year ago.\n\n\"That's bigger than many large utilities and more than twice as much as the 1.21 gigawatts it took to send Marty McFly back in time,\" Google Senior Vice President of Technical Infrastructure Urs Hölzle said in a statement, referencing the 1985 blockbuster movie \"Back to the Future.\"\n\nBut where the film's DeLorean time machine was powered by a lightning strike to its flux capacitor, Google says it will harness most of its power from wind turbines and solar panels. Such resources have become cost-competitive with fossil fuels in many regions, including states like Iowa, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Oregon, where Google is building the backbone of its U.S. data network.\n\n\"Our engineers have spent years perfecting Google's data centers, making them 50 percent more energy efficient than the industry average,\" Hölzle said. \"But we still need a lot of energy to process trillions of Google searches every year, play more than 400 hours of YouTube videos uploaded every minute, and power the products and services that our users depend on.\n\n\"That's why we began purchasing renewable energy — to reduce our carbon footprint and address climate change. But it also makes business sense,\" he added. \"Electricity costs are one of the largest components of our operating expenses at our data centers, and having a long-term stable cost of renewable power provides protection against price swings in energy.\"\n\nIt also places Google ahead of its IT rivals — Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft — in terms of total megawatts of renewable energy procured, according to data compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.\n\nGoogle's renewable energy announcement was made alongside the release of a larger environmental report, which for the first time distills the firm's sustainability goals and achievements — from energy efficiency and solid waste reduction to water conservation and the benefits of cloud computing — into one document.\n\nKate Brandt, Google's lead for sustainability, described the report as detailing \"the major pillars of our work ... so that other people can learn from what we've done.\"\n\nRenewables 'readily available'\n\nIn addition to its renewable energy procurement program, Google has deployed a variety of technologies to help its consumers bring clean energy benefits closer to home, Brandt said. For example, the company's Project Sunroof program used Google Earth 3-D imagery to help individual homeowners and even communities determine the potential for deploying rooftop solar panels.\n\nThe company has also invested heavily in what is known as \"machine learning\" to help boost the computing power of its data centers while using significantly less energy. According to Brandt, a Google data center today can extract 3.5 times more computing power from a single unit of energy compared with five years ago. That converts to millions of additional Google searches, Gmail deliveries and YouTube streamings with no additional environmental impact, officials said.\n\nReaction to Google's report, and especially to its pending clean energy milestone, was largely positive.\n\nGregory Wetstone, president and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy, said in a statement that Google's more than six-year commitment to renewable energy is \"paying off.\" He added that the 100 percent renewables achievement \"is a definitive demonstration that renewable energy is cost-effective and readily available at scale today.\"\n\nGreenpeace, which has closely tracked IT companies for the environmental impacts of their operations, including through the use of its annual \"Click Green Scorecard,\" described Google as \"a catalyst in the dramatic growth in renewable energy procurement among corporations.\"\n\nAmong other things, Greenpeace noted that Google was \"redefining the art of the possible by bringing significant renewable energy projects onto the same grid its data centers are powered from.\" That stands in contrast to some other IT firms that purchase renewable energy credits to meet clean energy goals but continue to power their data centers and offices with grid-delivered fossil energy.\n\nGary Cook, senior IT analyst for Greenpeace, said the timing of Google's announcement is also significant. Corporate action on renewables has been an important driver for the clean energy sector over the past five years, and Google is among the firms that got the ball rolling.\n\n\"Many companies have stood with the Obama administration's efforts to push for more renewable energy and action on climate change, and Google in particular has been putting their money where their mouth is,\" Cook said. \"Such continued leadership is likely to play an even more important role in the months to come, and companies who care about climate change and access to renewable energy need to stand up and be counted to accelerate the transition to a renewably powered economy.\"\n\nReporter Christa Marshall contributed.\n\nReprinted from ClimateWire with permission from E&E News.

The number could more than double to highs of $195 billion by 2021 according to the research firm given the rate at which various segments are gaining traction. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Samsung are poised to be the biggest beneficiaries of the expected growth given their investments in the fast-growing space.\n\nMarket Leaders\n\nHome automation and smart appliances continue to experience exponential growth driven by tech giants investing in them as the race for new opportunities for growth heats up. Google has already made an entry into the space with smart speakers and Google Home. Amazon’s Echo speaker is another smart home device that continues to dominate.\n\nSmart home hardware and services cover a gamut of categories including entertainment, healthcare automation and connected devices. It is for this reason that the fast emerging industry continues to attract investments from big tech companies that are looking for new opportunities for growth away from their core operations.\n\nGrowth Slowdown\n\nJuniper, however, expects the likes of Amazon, Apple, Samsung and Google to solidify their positions in smart home hardware given their already leading roles. The e-commerce giant for instance already boasts a robust cloud service that should give it an edge compared to other companies going forward\n\n“The company has managed to maximize its value proposition for Alexa by partnering with a large range of complementary players in the market, whilst utilizing its own cloud platform to set Echo and Alexa apart from its competitors in terms of functionality,“ Juniper said in a statement\n\nThe research firm has however warned that revenue growth in the most mature segment, which is smart entertainment, could slow from current levels as other segments gain traction. Smart appliance and home automation devices are slowly gaining traction. Entry of the likes of LittleBits, Notion and iVee into the 2 segments according to the research firm will fuel growth going forward.\n\nApple was unchanged in Tuesday trading session having rallied by 0.10% to close the day at $119.11 a share.

After lagging for a while, the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQ ) plowed into record territory this week. Strength came from the likes of Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are also working on bullish setups.\n\nSource: Apple\n\nThe earnings season will undoubtedly make or break these set ups. An easy way to bet long this upside potential is with a blanket long position on the QQQ. But today I want to focus on AAPL based on a specific thesis — the Samsung (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) effect.\n\nYes, I know it’s been overly exposed. But I will share my personal experience to illustrate my thoughts.\n\nFor years, my household has sided with Samsung phones. Until we recently had a phone literally catch fire. In our efforts to fix the phone (and while dealing with the thousand hoops that were imposed upon us) we ended up switching phones makers and providers.\n\nThe point of the story is this: One out of the three new phones ended up being an iPhone 7. This wasn’t because we were shopping for it, but rather that it was suggested by the salesperson and offered free by the provider. Conclusion: AAPL will gain incremental business from Samsung regardless of who is shopping for what. It’s what they call “pin action.”\n\nFundamentally, I reiterate my statement that the AAPL machine will continue to offer an attractive stock value. But I have very little faith that Tim Cook is the right leader for it. What I do see attractive here is the technical upside potential. AAPL stock has the potential to retest the highs. The set up is available for the bulls.\n\nThe Trade: Buy AAPL Mar $120/$125 debit call spread. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $1.80 per contract. This is my maximum potential loss. If Apple stock rallies past my spread, I stand to double my money. Options are time sensitive, so the March contract allows 65 days to be proven right.\n\nIn this case, I want to hedge my bets by selling downside risk against AAPL value to lower my upside entry cost. I don’t do this, however, unless I believe in the value of AAPL stock against which I am selling risk.\n\n\n\nNext Page", "By Mukta Samtani Published : January 11, 2017\n\nApple Stock (AAPL Stock) Is Looking Forward to a Game Changer\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been gaining ground of late, and AAPL stock is trading at around $119.00-plus levels now. As the company and its fans celebrate the 10th anniversary of the iconic “iPhone,” it is the right time to ponder what lies ahead for the company that has been defined by its smartphone.\n\nThere seems to be a clear problem ahead for the company, which was conspicuous by its absence from the Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2017) trade show in Las Vegas.\n\nThis problem has been mentioned in a report from The Wall Street Journal, which explains how the company seems to be lagging behind in executing its vision for artificial intelligence (AI), specifically voice-based interfaces. (Source: “Why Apple’s Critics Are Right This Time,” The Wall Street Journal, January 8, 2017.)\n\nAI is important to the company, as this technology is most likely to disrupt Apple the same way that Apple disrupted the smartphone industry. AAPL stock has been riding high for too long on the phenomenal success of the iPhone.\n\nAI-powered voice assistants are capable of replacing interactions with mobile devices. It does not mean that screens will not be needed anymore. However, users will become more inclined to talk to objects that can listen and interact with them. This is what is behind the success of Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) voice-based assistant “Alexa.”\n\nApple appears to be way behind in this race, and this is not good for Apple stock going forward. Amazon’s Alexa was a huge hit at the just-concluded CES 2017. At that trade show, a number of companies announced their devices that would be powered by Alexa.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has also launched its “Pixel” smartphone that has “Google Assistant” running the show. Alphabet executives were also there at the CES 2017 tech show, where they unveiled a number of devices that would be run on with Google Assistant. AAPL stock came under pressure last year when the Pixel got better reviews than Apple’s “iPhone 7.”\n\nThe Challenge for Apple Stock in 2017\n\nContrast this with the way things have been running at Apple Inc. on the AI front. Apple’s “Siri” has been around for a longer time, but still could never grab the attention that its competitors have been able to command. The company has been on an acquisition spree to strengthen its presence in AI but still does not have a serious contender to Amazon, Alphabet, or even Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nAs investors look forward to the quarterly results of Apple Inc., the whole focus will be on what plans that management has to keep itself ahead in the consumer technology space. AAPL stock is unlikely to grow much under the shadow of the iPhone now." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.06471072330447329, 0.1210529054279054, 0.07005766369047621 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4810752615440116, 0.5301656676656676, 0.5051748511904761 ], "publish_date" : [ null, { "$date" : "2017-01-12T15:40:36.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-11T09:23:53.000+0000" } ] }

Shares of the search giant could be headed for a near term correction.\n\n\n\nFlickr\n\nShares of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are likely to head much higher by the end of the year, backed by strong fundamentals. However, in the near term, GOOGL stock may be headed for a correction. Shares of Alphabet Inc have run up quite in a bit in the last month, and the stock is up by more than 7% since the 1st of February. Based on a combination of technical indicators, the stock looks set for a near term correction. Investors who want to own the stock could use any potential corrections as buying opportunities to enter the stock, given the strong long term outlook.\n\nGOOGL stock looks set for a near term correction - technical analysis.\n\nShares of Alphabet have had momentum strongly in their favor over the last few months. GOOGL stock has risen sharply from just over $750 a share in November last year, to over $872 a share, where it is trading currently. And if you go by the company's fundamentals, the rally may not be over yet. However, following a solid one month during which the stock gained by over 7%, GOOGL shares have entered overbought territory based on a combination of two popular technical indicators. The two indicators we're talking about are the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Bollinger Bands. For starters, let's look at the Relative Strength Index.\n\nThe RSI is a popular indicator that's used to highlight overbought and oversold situations. For those unfamiliar, the RSI basically compares the magnitude of recent gains with recent losses, over a specified time period, to measure speed and change of price movements of the underlying security. The standard time frame that's used is 14 days. However, traders can potentially use a different time frame that they like. In essence, the RSI basically quantifies recent momentum. When the RSI is above 70, it indicates an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is indicative of an oversold condition. Again, traders do use their own thresholds to identify overbought and oversold states, but these are the most commonly used thresholds. If you look at a technical chart for GOOGL stock, the RSI entered overbought territory, rising to 71.9 on Thursday, and subsequently to 72.8 on Friday.\n\nThe other popular indicator that's signalling an overbought condition is the Bollinger Band. Bollinger Bands are plotted two standard deviations away from a simple moving average, both above and below it. The most commonly used is the 21 day Simple Moving Average (SMA). While the two standard deviations capture ~90% of the price movements, if the stock price touches the band above, the upper band, it's deemed to be overbought. If the stock price touches the lower band, it is deemed to be oversold. For now, GOOGL shares have hit the upper band, indicating that the stock is currently in overbought territory, and could correct in the near term.\n\nSumming It Up - Buy GOOGL Stock On Dips.\n\nDespite the possibility of a correction in the near term, GOOGL stock still looks attractive for long term investors. Even with its massive revenue base, Alphabet Inc is still managing to deliver solid growth. And if reports are to be believed, Google is also catching up with Amazon in the cloud computing market. To be clear, Google still has a long way to go before it can worry Amazon, but The Motley Fool's Evan Niu suggests that it is indeed catching up, albeit slowly. We'd discussed this in more detail ourselves in a recent article that looked at whether GOOGL stock was really worth $1000, as many analysts have suggested it does. As things stand, GOOGL stock is a good bet for 2017. We believe that shares of Alphabet Inc are headed higher, and we like the stock fundamentally, to the extent that we've added it to our list of top stock picks, which have beaten the NASDAQ by over 134%.\n\nIf you think that's impressive, and you're also looking for good stocks from the auto sector, here's our list of top auto stock picks, which have beaten the S&P 500 by over 170%." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1462499999999999 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4404910714285714 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-20T05:56:54.000+0000" } ] }

GOOGL will report fourth-quarter 2016 earnings on Jan 26 after the bell.\n\nThe surprise history has been decent in Alphabet’s case. The company missed estimates just once in the last four quarters, that too by a small margin.\n\nComing to the price performance, over the past one year, shares of Alphabet have been steadily treading higher. The stock has returned 12.89% compared with the Zacks categorized Internet Services industry’s gain of 12.78%.\n\nView photos\n\nWhat Happened in the Last Reported Quarter?\n\nAlphabet’s third-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues which also grew year over year. The increase was primarily driven by the boom in Mobile Search, with the ongoing strength in YouTube. Also, strength in programmatic advertising and Play aided revenue growth. Other Bets revenues remained lumpy.\n\nFactors at Play in Q4\n\nThe main drivers of the Google business haven’t changed. Pricing remains under pressure, both on account of the ongoing FX concerns as well as continued strength in mobile and TrueView. Volumes are however encouraging as total paid click growth was a reassuring 33% last quarter.\n\nGoogle has gained strength in the mobile platform. Management is focused on driving mobile experiences and the company is well positioned to pick up strong intent-to-buy signals as a result of studying mobile searches from its huge database. As a result, revenue from mobile platform is expected to increase in the upcoming results.\n\nYouTube remains a strong contributor benefiting from the increase in online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged with the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers every day.\n\nAlso, Google has turned more aggressive toward the commercialization of its self-driving cars. It aims to expand its revenues from this segment in the upcoming release. However, the current regulatory environment doesn’t support fully automated cars, so there could be some problems on their part.\n\nGoogle’s cloud business trails Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure and IBM. The company’s cloud business is expected to well in the to-be reported quarter. And finally, Google platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream continue to help it draw more users and sell more ads.\n\nOn a cautionary note, Google’s troubles in the EU are mounting and despite its attempts to appease authorities by investing in the region, the region may prove much more expensive for it. Google is not providing for this outflow, which could mean that it still has a reasonable chance to come out victorious. But the developments are worth keeping an eye on as these are the main reasons for the overhang on the company’s shares.\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not show that Alphabet will beat on earnings this third quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.\n\nThe company’s Zacks Rank #2 and Earnings ESP of -0.26% make surprise prediction difficult. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nWe don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement.\n\nAlphabet Inc.

How many other organizations have ruled the age of the internet quite like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)? We spend countless hours on each site keeping up with friends and binge-watching our favorite shows.\n\nIn fact, with the addition of Alphabet and Amazon, I think we'd be hard-pressed to find more influential companies in today's society. That fact has not been lost on investors. Over the past four years, both stocks have quintupled in value.\n\nBut which is a better buy today? That's a difficult question to answer, though we can get a better understanding for what we're buying by looking at the question through three different lenses.\n\nSustainable competitive advantages\n\nIf I had one word of advice for beginning investors, it would be this: Spend the bulk of your time investigating a company's sustainable competitive advantages. Often referred to as a \"moat\" by investors, sustainable competitive advantages are what keep customers coming back for more every year and consistently keep the competition at bay.\n\nNetflix benefits from, as I see it, three different types of moats. The first is the brand. The Qwikster fiasco not withstanding, the company has won over legions of loyal customers who appreciate the service and its original content. That original content is key, as it is gets people hooked into the Netflix ecosystem.\n\nManagement is able to target its original content because it has more data on our viewing habits than any other organization in the history of the world. That also gives the company the upper hand when it comes to paying for content from third-party providers. Imagine the negotiating table: Netflix knows just how popular certain shows are to its viewers and how valuable it is. The other side has no idea. That asymmetry provides pricing power.\n\nFinally, Netflix benefits from a sneaky type of moat I only recently came to appreciate. Once customers sign on, the cost of the monthly plan is so low -- and the payments fully automated -- that a user would have to be highly motivated to cancel his/her membership.\n\nFacebook, on the other hand, benefits from one of the most powerful moats in the world: the network effect. With each additional member who joins Facebook, non-members are incentivized to join as a way of keeping up with their friends and family. It's a virtuous cycle that is in full effect. Even though the company already has over 1 billion daily active users, its roster continues to grow -- up 18% year over year.\n\nNot only that but Facebook gets essentially all of its content for free. That's often underappreciated by investors. Imagine what a boon it would be if Netflix never had to pay for its shows.\n\nAt the end of the day, both of these companies have powerful moats. In years past, I would have given the nod to Facebook. But my realization of how easy it is for Netflix to keep subscribers -- and how effective original content is at bringing in new users -- is enough to call this a draw.\n\nWinner = Tie\n\nFinancial fortitude\n\nWhile conservative investors love seeing cash returned to them via dividends and more aggressive investors love seeing cash reinvested in a company's growth prospects, there's something to be said for cash.\n\nEvery company will experience difficult financial times, and the companies that enter those phases with lots of cash will prosper. They will have the flexibility to outspend rivals and gain market share, repurchase stock on the cheap, and even make strategic acquisitions. Debt-laden companies will be in the opposite boat, forced to satisfy the whims of their creditors.\n\nCompany Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Netflix $1.7 billion $3.4 billion $0.2 billion ($1.6 billion) Facebook $30 billion $0 $10.2 billion $11.6 billion\n\nHere, we have a very clear winner. Netflix is spending lots of cash on its international expansion and original programing. That's a great strategy because, as mentioned above, once customers are locked in, they're a reliable source of recurring revenue.\n\nBut with that strategy comes financial fragility. Netflix is free cash flow negative, while Facebook is a cash machine with no long-term debt whatsoever.\n\nWinner = Facebook\n\nValuation\n\nFinally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is.\n\nCompany P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Netflix 340 N/A 1.6 Facebook 32 34 1.1\n\nHere again, we have a clear winner. Because of the aforementioned spending, Netflix is very expensive based on traditional metrics.\n\nFacebook, on the other hand, looks like a pretty good deal at today's prices. While a P/E of 32 would never be described as \"cheap,\" the company increased earnings by 86% last year, and is expected to grow by 28% moving forward.\n\nWinner = Facebook\n\nThe winner is...\n\nSo there you have it: While both companies have powerful moats, Facebook has a better balance sheet and appears to be a better value at today's prices. You really can't go wrong by investing in either, but I'm a much stronger fan of Facebook at today's levels. That helps explain why it accounts for 14% of my real-life holdings, while Netflix clocks in at just 2%." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1563101457929044 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.5384977857391652 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-02-28T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

The person asked not to be identified because the decisions were not public. An Alphabet spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.\n\nAn invitation went out earlier this week from members of Trump’s transition team, including venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Oracle Corp. co-CEO Safra Catz, and Cisco Systems Inc. CEO Chuck Robbins have said they plan to attend.\n\nThe technology news website Recode reported earlier that Page, Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook and Facebook Inc. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg will go, along with Intel Corp. CEO Brian Krzanich. Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos has also been invited and is likely to attend, Recode added.\n\nWhile an agenda was not listed on the invitation, the discussion is expected to touch on issues, including immigration and trade, where Trump’s positions during the campaign were opposed by most of the tech industry.\n\nEric Schmidt Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg\n\n“Tech was very heavily for Hillary Clinton and that was where they put their money and their algorithms,” Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” “He will be president for all Americans and that includes these important industries. I’m glad they’re coming.”\n\nMending Fences\n\nAlphabet has become a major lobbying force in Washington, and has a wide range of national policy interests. Those include taxes on offshore earnings, data encryption, autonomous vehicles, telecommunications spectrum, and health care. Trump has proposed weakening net neutrality rules, a longstanding priority for Google and other internet companies.\n\nThe meeting, scheduled for 2 p.m. on Dec. 14, will likely focus on possible repatriation of overseas earnings and corporate tax reform, said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. But it will primarily be a chance for tech’s leaders to find some common ground with an uncertain administration.\n\n“This is something of a mending fences, building bridges kind of meeting,” he said. “The goal may be to get Trump to be somewhat supportive of the tech industry.”\n\nChina on Agenda\n\nAtkinson also said the meeting may address China, where several U.S. tech companies have struggled to find a foothold. Google pulled its services from mainland China in 2010 primarily over concerns about censorship.\n\nSchmidt’s attendance at the round table is not surprising -- the executive, who was Google CEO when it withdrew from China, is the company’s primary political and diplomatic emissary.\n\nYet Schmidt was also a prominent backer of Clinton, Trump’s Democratic competitor. Leaked documents posted online by WikiLeaks revealed e-mails between Schmidt and top Clinton aides about the campaign’s strategy, and he was photographed wearing a staff badge at Clinton’s headquarters on election night.\n\nPage is more technology visionary than political operative, and he has shied away from public appearances. The gravity of the meeting next week may have forced his hand.\n\n“If Trump calls,” said Atkinson, “if you’re a CEO, you go.”" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.101235380116959 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4801900584795322 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-11T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

The difference between the estimate and actual was $-0.09 which created a surprise factor of -1.18%.\n\n28 analysts polled by Zacks Research currently have a mean target price of $964.428 on shares. The analyst with the highest target price sees the stock hitting $1100 and the lowest target estimate sees the stock touching $700 within the year. In looking at the standard deviation of all estimates, we arrive at 78.388. Zacks Research also uses an analyst ratings scale that ranges from 1 to 5. Using this scale, a 1 would represent a Strong Buy, and a 5 rating would indicate a Strong Sell rating. Using all the ratings on Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the mean sits at 1.33.

Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-center servers -- the machines at the heart of cloud computing.\n\nWhile profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signaled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,\" Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. \"I definitely think we’re going to have a great year.\"\n\nWhat started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centers to support their own web services.\n\n‘Disruptive Forces’\n\nMore than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner estimated in July. \"This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age,\" the research firm said at the time.\n\nStock prices reflect this optimism. Microsoft and Alphabet shares hit a record this week. Microsoft gained 2.2 percent, Google was down about 1 percent and Intel rose 1.5 percent at 1:57 p.m. Friday in New York.\n\nMicrosoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 percent in the fiscal second quarter.\n\n\"As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who rates Microsoft shares outperform. “If margins are growing, people are even happier.\"\n\nMicrosoft’s Effort\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nRedmond, Washington-based Microsoft has been spending on data centers and adding products to win new cloud customers. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would \"materially improve\" in the current year. That’s because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centers support more customers.\n\nMicrosoft has pledged to reach annualized revenue of $20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than $14 billion at the end of the second quarter.\n\nIntel’s fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 percent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 percent less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said.\n\n“It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call.\n\nAmazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate $3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 percent from a year earlier.\n\n\"Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud,\" Moerdler said. \"Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack.”", "When Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) was left for dead five years ago, it was unimaginable that it could be ranked among America’s most successful companies as it had been for the two decades of Windows’ dominance.

(NASDAQ: GOOGL), the owner of Google, in market cap, as the search company struggles to find new large and fast-growing businesses.\n\nMicrosoft has come close to doing what was once impossible: becoming the second most valuable public company in America, trailing only Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). After earnings, Alphabet’s stock sold down so that its market cap is about $565 billion. Microsoft’s rose to $515 billion.\n\nMicrosoft’s earnings, matched against Alphabet’s, show the extent to which CEO Satya Nadella has transformed the company. Microsoft’s Productivity and Businesses division had revenue of $7.3 billion. The division has both the consumer and business sides of the old Windows business. The Intelligent Cloud division is Microsoft’s huge cloud intuitive, which is large enough to threaten industry leader Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). Its revenue was $6.9 billion. More Personal Computing, the third division, had revenue of $11.8 billion. It has the legacy game segment, search and Microsoft OEM.\n\nGoogle, on the other hand, continues to rely almost completely on search, which makes it the one-legged stool that creates investor anxiety. Google ad revenue was $19.1 billion of the fourth quarter total of $21.2 billion. And the aggregate cost per click, one of Google’s most important metrics, fell 9% year over year. Its revenue from what it calls “other bets” was a mere $262 million.\n\nAs investors look for stability with large tech companies, which currently trade at historically high levels, they can only find it in public corporations that successfully operate multiple businesses. Microsoft’s shares have risen 23% in the past year, about the same as the Nasdaq, and Alphabet’s by 14%. This does not take into account stock movements after earnings announcements. At the rate of growth in stock prices, Microsoft will be the more valuable of the two companies by mid-year.", "Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is up $0.21 to $64.48 in after-hours trading Thursday after the company reported its FY17 second-quarter earnings results.\n\nThe software giant posted non-GAAP earnings of $0.83 per share on revenues of $26.07 billion, up 1.5% from a year ago. Analysts were expecting EPS of $0.79 on revenues of $25.29 billion. Microsoft said revenue in Intelligent Cloud was $6.86 billion and increased 8% (up 10% in constant currency), ahead of the guidance the company had set of between $6.55 billion to $6.75 billion. Analysts expected the company’s cloud segment to bring in about $6.73 billion. Revenue from Azure, Microsoft’s major cloud offering, jumped 93 percent year over year with its commercial cloud annualized run rate passing $14 billion. In October, Azure saw revenue growth of 116 percent.\n\nMeanwhile “productivity and business processes” revenue was up 10% and $7.4 billion.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella highlighted out advances in artificial intelligence, stating: “Accelerating advancements in AI across our platforms and services will provide further opportunity to drive growth in the Microsoft Cloud.”\n\nThe company’s “More Personal Computing” division saw revenue decline 5% to $11.8 billion driven primarily by lower phone revenue.\n\nThis was the first quarter since Microsoft closed its $24 billion acquisition of LinkedIn which accounted for $228 million in revenue and a net loss of $100 million for the quarter.\n\nEarlier Thursday, as the Dow hit 20,100 points, Microsoft stock printed a new all-time high of $64.54. The median Street price target on the name is $69 with a high target of $80. Currently ticker boasts 23 ‘Buy’ endorsements, compared to 9 ‘Holds’ and 2 ‘Sell’.\n\nMSFT is up nearly 23 percent year-over-year, and 3.43% year-to-date.\n\n—\n\nGoogle-parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dropped $18.65 to $813.50 in after-hours trading after it reported fiscal results for the fourth-quarter.\n\nIn its quarterly report, the search giant said it earned $9.36 per share, slightly below the $9.62 per share analysts were expecting. Revenue rose 22.2% y/y to $26.06 billion, above views for $25.14 billion. The increase is attributed to advertisers who are spending more to reach an expanding user base that spends more time on smartphones and YouTube.\n\n“Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional — with revenues up 22% year on year and 24% on a constant currency basis., said in a statement Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet, adding “This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube. We’re seeing great momentum in Google’s newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets.”\n\nAlphabet’s “Other Bets” revenue increased to $262 million from $150 million a year earlier.\n\nMountain View also said the “paid clicks” in its Google advertising business rose by 36% compared with a 33% increase in the third quarter, while cost per click declined by 15%.\n\nGOOGL currently prints a one year return of about 15%, and a year-to-date return of 8.14%." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1401038688774538, 0.132583300537846, 0.1224262360446571 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3993329521631408, 0.4547912567230749, 0.4956459330143539 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-01-27T00:00:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-27T00:00:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-26T19:40:50.000+0000" } ] }

Year-to-date, GOOGL has gained 7.24%, versus a 4.81% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.\n\nGOOGL currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 43 stocks in the Internet category.\n\nThis article is brought to you courtesy of AfraidToTrade.com." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.07328395061728393 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.2676419753086419 ], "publish_date" : [ null ] }

The result is that a large number of the traditional technology leaders are under pressure from their charts.\n\nFacebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are all in the position of lagging broader indices. It has become time for a make-or-break situation as each are currently facing short-term chart resistance.\n\nFacebook Inc (FB)\n\nShares of Facebook had struggled since the election for a few reasons. The drop in price transitioned the 50-day moving average for FB stock into a bearish trend, indicating a higher probability of lower prices over the next 4 to 6 weeks if the trend remains in place.\n\nThe fact that the stock recently moved below its heavily monitored 200-day trendline and is now finding resistance at the $120-price where it resides has put Facebook shares into this must-win situation. This is FB’s current “must-win” price as a break above will open some room overhead for the stock to move higher.\n\nFacebook shares recently benefited from an oversold technical bounce, but volume has dried after that rally, indicating that the bounce may be more of the “dead cat” variety.\n\nFor now, traders should steer clear of FB as a rejection at $120 is likely to target another wave of selling and the potential for Facebook to test its June lows of $108.\n\nTesla Motors Inc (TSLA)\n\nAnother technology company struggling in a downward trend is Tesla Motors. Since peaking in April, TSLA shares have shed over 25% as the stock charts a pattern of lower highs and lower lows. The pattern suggests that Tesla stock is suffering as traders and investors are taking any rally as an opportunity to reduce holdings.\n\nFrom a long-term perspective, TSLA is trading in a bear market as the stock is well below its 20-month moving average, which is also trending lower. Some traders may see Tesla stock as a “value”, but the technical trend suggests otherwise.\n\nLooking at the chart, TSLA’s “must win” price is at $195; the spot where its 50-day moving average currently sits. This trendline has been staunch resistance for Tesla stock since it rolled over in August and began to trend lower.\n\nFrom there, TSLA stock gets into a technical pinch as support is immediately below at $180. This means that we’re likely to see an increase in volatility in Tesla shares as one of these key levels is going to give way for the next big move in the stock.\n\nNext Page" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.03032270759543487 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4065590974681884 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-03T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) clearly beats Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with its long term vision and product strategy.\n\nAmazon’s Pioneer Products in IoT\n\nAmazon launched its smart home assistant speaker, Amazon Echo back in 2014 when Google and Apple were just in the rudimentary stages of realizing the fact that smartphones and apps are approaching their saturation points and the future belongs to AI and Internet of Things. In 2016 holiday season, Amazon Echo and Echo Dot were the most popular devices bought by people. Echo Dot is the latest mode of Amazon Echo. It is powered by Alexa, the smart assistant which takes user voice commands and execute them. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is clearly a trend setter in IoT, a market where estimated annual revenues are excepted to surpass $470 billion by 2020. Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has recently launched Android Things, a special operating system for making IoT-based mobile apps and software. Google also launched Google Home, a smart home suite, in November 2016. Alphabet has another interesting product called “Nest” which acts as a smart device to control temperature, detect fire and control devices. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also has its own IoT platform, HomeKit. However, it didn’t get the expected popularity.\n\nAdvanced Real-Time Chart: If not automatically loaded with the correct symbol related to this article, you can manually enter it (ex. AAPL) to update the chart.\n\nAmazon’s Powerful Footprint in eBooks Industry\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) receives a huge chunk of its revenue from its Kindle product line. The company started selling Kindle reading devices based on the popularity of eBooks. Today, Amazon has over 70% of eBook market share. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) do not have a footprint in this area.\n\nAmazon Dwarfing Google, Apple in Cloud\n\nAmazon remains the leader in Cloud services, thanks to its sterling Cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon’s AWS revenue in 2016 is expected to come in at $12 billion, compared to $7.9 billion last year. Over the past four quarters, AWS accounted for two-thirds of Amazon’s operating profits. Amazon.com’s, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) only competitors in this area are Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft. Apple has no Cloud platform for advanced Enterprise. Its iCloud service is only for iOS and Mac users. Apple’s adherence to its ecosystem-centric approach may cost the company dearly in the future.\n\nAmazon’s Revolutionary Technology in Retail\n\nAmazon recently revealed Amazon Go, a disruptive new way to do shopping in stores. Amazon Go promises to change the way we shop forever. Amazon Go promises no checkout lines and quick shopping in an unprecedented way. Check out this video to see what Amazon Go is all about and how it works.\n\nProblem with Apple and Google\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is focusing entirely on trying to reinvigorate growth in its iPhone product line, which has clearly lost steam, and future is not looking very promising, as well. Apple slashed its iPhone 7 production orders by 10% for the first quarter of 2017, a clear sign that the company will have to tap into other areas like IoT, robots, content and AI. Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google deserves appreciation on its ambitious “moonshot” projects. From robots to energy and self-driving cars, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has invested in to multiple product lines. But the company seems to have an execution problem. It has invested millions in moonshot projects so far has faced problems after failing to properly use its robotics startups.\n\nAmazon’s Future is Bright\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also working on new product delivery methods, self-driving trucks, streaming content and drones. The company has a flexible working structure and no standardization, thanks to Jeff Bezos’ vision.", "Though markets closed mixed on Friday, investors would be looking to extend gains on Monday when the market opens.

There has been so much happening behind the scenes given the market domination of the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Hulu. The dominance is one of the major concerns that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has to struggle with in sustaining competition. Thus it put its acts together and perhaps something more attractive from what the other services are offering.\n\nOn that note, Cook says that the company has plans for original content and the Apple TV. It is also focusing on Apple Music. Recently Apple increased the limit of the selected size for apps on the Apple TV from 200MB to 4GB. This is one of the strategies that is expected to make the device more appealing, especially to game designers.\n\nCook outlines more specific plans for the future of Apple’s media plans\n\nApple TV has come a long way in its first year, an unfolding that Cook describes as fulfilling. He quotes, “We started the new Apple TV a year ago, we’re pleased on how that platform has come along. We have more things planned for it, but it’s come a long way in a year, and it gives us a clear platform to build off of.”\n\nHowever, this has not been without a challenge given that Apple TV’s internal memory hasn’t increased beyond 64GB. That means in its current form, it may not be able to hold many of the bigger apps. Nonetheless, there are clear indications that Apple is having much more to offer.\n\nApple has only thus far “dipped its toe in the water” Cook reiterates\n\nOne of the strongest advantages of the Apple TV is the subscription platform. So far the company has garnered close to 150 million paid subscriptions a number of them being third-party services. Cook restates that the company has more things planned for it thus this is just the beginning. Clearly, Apple is not giving up on Apple TV, which is referred to as the future of television. Meanwhile, Apple’s stock closed at $121.35 a fall of $0.28 or 0.23%.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1705172718438024, 0.04375000000000001, 0.1385665869218501 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4864343139853343, 0.3673076923076923, 0.4924441786283893 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-01-02T12:50:09.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-30T00:00:00.000+0000" }, null ] }

The Information reports that those requests couldn't be handled without human agents, and bots built by outside developers \"had issues\" because the \"technology to understand human requests wasn't developed enough.\"\n\nSo instead of building a large ecosystem of chatbots, Facebook will train Messenger bots to handle \"a narrower set of cases, so users aren't disappointed by the limitations of automation.\" Let's see what this strategic shift means for Facebook's AI efforts, and whether or not chatbots will ever become meaningful tools for the social network.\n\nUnderstanding Facebook's AI strategy\n\nArtificial intelligence plays a vital role in helping Facebook track users and deliver targeted ads. By using AI to scan a user's status updates, photos, videos, check-ins, likes, linked apps, and other data, Facebook generates digital profiles of users which help it deliver targeted ads to their News Feeds. In 2013, Facebook launched the FAIR (Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research) unit to continuously upgrade those AI capabilities.\n\nThat's where Messenger comes in. In 2014, Facebook forced users to download the stand-alone Messenger app to keep chatting. That move -- which clearly mirrored Tencent's (NASDAQOTH:TCEHY) WeChat -- laid the foundations for Messenger to become a \"platform\" which could eventually offer ride hailing, mobile payments, deliveries, games and other services from a single app.\n\nThat move would give Facebook an \"OS within an OS\" to counter the iOS App Store and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Play. Facebook's next step would be to replace apps with Messenger chatbots, which were introduced last April. If that effort works, it could turn the entire mobile app store model upside down.\n\nThe premature rise of the chatbots\n\nIn theory, a business chatbot could answer questions, make purchase suggestions, process orders, and send shipping updates to customers. For customers, having \"conversations\" with these bots would feel more natural than scrolling and clicking through a mobile app. Companies could also cut costs by reducing the number of human customer service representatives.\n\nFacebook tethers those bots to Messenger for Business, which provides a live customer service chat channel for a large number of businesses. Businesses can choose to put a human or a chatbot to handle queries on their end. This idea attracted a lot of early adopters -- 30,000 Facebook bots were already active on Messenger as of last September.\n\nBut just as Google struggled with low-quality apps over the years, Facebook's ecosystem quickly became bogged down with poorly produced chatbots. Badly made bots could annoy customers and tarnish a company's image -- so the company decided it's a better idea to send the bots back to the drawing board than expand the overall ecosystem.\n\nFacebook should've seen this coming\n\nThe limitations of AI-powered bots were already clear when Facebook launched its chatbot APIs last year. For example, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) launched its chatbot Tay on Twitter as an experiment last March. Within 24 hours, Tay started tweeting racist and sexist comments, forcing Microsoft to abruptly pull the plug and issue an apology. Tencent has also struggled to purge spam and scam bots on WeChat since it started letting millions of accounts create their own bots.\n\nFacebook's AI tech also wasn't that impressive prior to the arrival of its chatbots. Its News Feed struggled to discern fake news headlines from real ones, and its Messenger-based virtual assistant M hasn't gained much ground against Google Now or Siri.\n\nEdison Investment analyst Richard Windsor -- who recently called Facebook a \"laggard in AI\" compared to Google -- stated that \"when Facebook tries to automate its systems, things always go wrong.\" He also pointed out that while Facebook has hired plenty of AI talent, it simply hasn't been working on AI \"for nearly long enough\" to challenge market leaders like Google.\n\nSo what's next for Facebook's AI efforts?\n\nDespite those missteps, Facebook probably won't stop investing in chatbots anytime soon. The company is expected to introduce new AI plans at its F8 conference in April, which will likely include ways to boost the quality, not quantity, of its Messenger bots. It could also introduce more ways to tether bots into other Messenger features -- like payments and games -- to increase the app's appeal as a stand-alone platform." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.0008139430014430047 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3926181457431456 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-02-28T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

Google is leaving no stone unturned in the process of growing.", "Susan Wojcicki will forever be part of Google's history. The company literally started in her home and garage, which she rented in 1998 to two graduate students, Sergey Brin and Larry Page.\n\nNow in her third decade at Google and entering her fourth year as YouTube's CEO, the 48-year-old executive has the best shot in 2017 to prove YouTube can translate its huge audience into more revenue and to lead the remaking of television into a video-everywhere model that appeals to a younger generation weaned on smartphones and Netflix.\n\nIt feels cruel to ding a business that has more than a billion monthly users globally, has become a verb and generates multiple billions of dollars in revenue each year. Yet Wojcicki hasn't changed the fact that YouTube helped popularize digital video but hasn't yet lived up to its enormous financial potential.\n\nTV Loses Its Crown Internet ads, including those on YouTube, are expected to overtake TV in 2017 as the world's biggest advertising medium Sources: Estimates from ZenithOptimedia and Bloomberg Intelligence\n\nConsider this: Facebook Inc. is on track to generate more than $27 billion in revenue this year, nearly all from advertising messages on Facebook and Instagram. That will work out to an average of about $16 for each person using Facebook and its sister app, Facebook Messenger.\n\nParent company Alphabet Inc. doesn’t disclose YouTube’s revenue or specific user numbers, but we can make some rough assumptions. Research firm eMarketer estimates YouTube will generate about $5.58 billion in 2016 revenue, excluding the share of advertising dollars YouTube splits with the companies that make its web videos and with distribution partners. If YouTube has somewhere between 1.2 billion and 1.65 billion monthly users, that is roughly $3.50 to $5 in revenue from each user.\n\nGranted, YouTube's business model is different from that of Facebook or Google web search. For one, YouTube doles out a significant chunk of its revenue to the creators of many of its videos. But the gap exists, and it spotlights the broad challenge for Wojcicki: YouTube could be so much more as the world's biggest web video hangout tethered to the internet's best money machine.\n\nThe opportunity is there if Wojcicki can take advantage of it, because the winds are blowing in YouTube's favor. Younger people are spending less time watching traditional television and more time glued to their smartphones -- including YouTube. Advertising revenue will eventually follow those viewers into digital video hangouts.\n\nWojcicki has also continued YouTube's success in reshaping entertainment by coaxing large media companies such as NBC Universal to devote more programming to YouTube, and by minting YouTube personalities like PewDiePie and Lilly Singh, whose videos can draw more people than those from traditional entertainment companies.\n\nStay Tuned YouTube's opportunity is to close the gap between the share of time Americans spend watching digital video compared with television, and the relatively outsized share of advertising dollars spent on TV Source: Bloomberg Intelligence and eMarketer\n\nFulfilling YouTube's potential lies in building a bridge to television, where 40 percent of advertising budgets are spent and where the rules of the game have sometimes eluded Google. Yes, huge audience size matters, but so does the mix of large numbers of people, the kind of people that the advertisers want to pitch to, and the shelter of programming that advertisers want to get behind. Google and YouTube have never fully embraced the rules of so-called brand advertising.\n\nUnder Wojcicki, YouTube has been working to change that. YouTube two years ago started to let advertisers plant their commercial messages next to popular video channels from professional entertainment companies or personalities, separate from the flood of mass market videos. It's not perfect, but the new advertiser option made YouTube operate a bit more like TV, and analysts say the ad rates YouTube generates are in the same range as television ad prices.\n\nGo for the Bronze Marketers in a recent survey said ads on Google and Facebook generate the biggest bang for their buck -- with YouTube in third place. YouTube has more to do to convince advertisers of its value. Source: RBC and Advertising Age\n\nYouTube is working with the advertising industry on standardizing viewership ratings across traditional television and web video -- another step to get advertisers comfortable with YouTube. YouTube is also creating a new business model, with the creation of its first significant subscription video service -- and soon to be a second -- including programming exclusive to YouTube. That makes YouTube dip into the same business as cable television and Netflix.\n\nEven while the winds are at YouTube's back, it has more competition than ever for people's leisure time and advertisers' money. Facebook, Netflix, Snapchat, AT&T, Twitter, Amazon, Verizon, Apple and many of the traditional TV networks are also vying at least to some degree with their own digital video features, and in some cases for the same crop of professional new media stars and the advertising money that follows.\n\nWojcicki has in her favor Google’s limitless resources, and growing credit from advertisers for catering to their needs. YouTube has already changed entertainment and the internet. Now for YouTube to get to the next level, Wojcicki has to bridge the canyon between the worlds of TV and the web.

Partners With BMW, Gap", "\nGoogle to introduce augmented-reality shopping in new project with Gap, BMW" ], "article_text" : [ "Google is working to create new shopping experiences for consumers. The company announced retail partnerships with BMW and Gap Inc. to use its augmented reality (AR) platform Project Tango and work towards creating a shopping experience in which shoppers do not need to be physically present at the retail outlet, but they can choose products as if they were.\n\n“We see a lot of use of this technology in retail, for measuring your garage or buying big-ticket items like kitchens for example,” Eric Johnsen, business development executive, augmented reality at Google, spoke at CES in Las Vegas on Wednesday, where the deals were announced.\n\nTango uses computer vision comprising of technologies such as 3D mapping, motion-tracking and AR instead of GPS to help devices sense their environments.\n\nGoogle’s technology venture will use cameras and sensors in smartphone to create digital images in physical spaces, the best example of which is the AR game Pokémon Go.\n\nWhile Google’s deal with Gap Inc. will help consumer shop in Gap stores just like they would usually do — checking out and trying out merchandize, its deal with BMW is a little different.\n\nWith BMW, Google is trying out an AR app which will display its i3 and i8 cars on smartphone screens.\n\nCar buyers will be able to check out superimposed vehicles and will not just be able to choose from different colors, trims and wheels but will also be able to place a high-resolution image of the vehicle inside their garage or driveway. BMW says that the app will be available at dealerships globally.", "Google is rolling out a real world application for its most ambitious virtual-reality effort: letting shoppers see what they might buy without leaving home.\n\nThe Alphabet Inc. unit on Wednesday introduced two new retail partnerships, with BMW and Gap Inc., deploying its 3D-scanning project called Tango. The technology uses cameras and sensors in mobile devices to overlay digital images in physical space – akin to the hit mobile game Pokemon Go. The retail deals announced at the consumer technology show CES in Las Vegas hint at Google’s broader ambition to merge its mapping capabilities with its core business of facilitating commerce.\n\nAs virtual- and augmented-reality technology rapidly improves, analysts predict the retail industry may be one the biggest beneficiaries. IDC estimates the market for the technologies will explode from about $5.2-billion (U.S.) in 2015 to $162-billion in 2020. Car dealerships will be “one of the longer-term, more profitable use cases,” said IDC analyst Chris Chute, as auto makers look for way to reach customers who are increasingly less likely to enter traditional outlets.\n\nBMW is testing a new app that displays an i3 city vehicle and i8 sports car on smartphone screens. Car shoppers can walk around the superimposed vehicles, placing it to look life-size inside their driveway or garage. Users can choose from six different colours, four types of trims and wheels, all appearing in a high-resolution image.\n\nThe Munich-based luxury auto maker said the mobile app will be available at dealerships in 11 countries. “It’s possible we’ll develop a kind of library of models for this app,” said Stefan Biermann, head of innovations for sales for BMW.\n\nAt a recent presentation in Munich, the display image of an i3, even on a small phone screen, was convincing enough for users to duck and lift their legs to step inside the vehicle, where they could push a button to turn on the lights and the radio.\n\n“We see a lot of use of this technology in retail, for measuring your garage or buying big-ticket items like kitchens for example,” Eric Johnsen, who heads business development for augmented reality at Google, said at the event.\n\nBloomberg News reported earlier that Google plans to use the indoor mapping capability of Tango to generate advertising revenue. Mr. Johnsen said Google isn’t getting revenue from sales with its newly announced partnerships, but declined to comment further on business plans.\n\nOn top of the BMW app, Google announced two more developments for Tango on Wednesday. A new app allows shoppers to test clothes from the Gap brand using Tango. And Google added a new hardware partner: The Zenphone from Asustek Computer Inc. is now compatible with Tango’s technology.\n\nHowever, both announcements reveal the limitations of Google’s efforts. For one, there aren’t many consumers that can try it out. The Asus Zenfone is only the second model to enable Tango, following a device from Lenovo Group Ltd.\n\nAnd it’s still incomplete for consumers that try the technology. With the mobile app for Gap, for instance, shoppers try on outfits using a 3D digital avatar, rather than superimpose the clothes on their bodies. The latter tactic might arrive eventually, but the tech needed is still in its infancy.\n\n“Producing content for these mediums is extremely hard,” said Shanna Tellerman, founder of Modsy, a startup that uses three-dimensional technology for e-commerce. “It often looks a little bit janky.”\n\nGoogle is aware of the problem. In addition to challenges with realistic rendering, mobile 3D mapping is constrained by difficulties imposed by lighting and geographic space, said Johnny Lee, director of engineering for Tango. The gap between expectations of the technology and its reality can do more harm than good.\n\n“When people think about augmented reality, they think of science-fiction quality effects,” he said.\n\nThat’s also the rationale behind Google’s cautious implementation of Tango on devices, Mr. Lee explained. While the company ultimately plans for the tech to function inside every mobile device, it now doesn’t reach a vast majority of Android smartphones.\n\nHardware changes demanded from Tango’s sensors also may give Google’s manufacturing partners pause. However, that might change if the tech becomes ubiquitous. Other software companies – Microsoft Corp., Facebook Inc. and Snap Inc. – are investing heavily in augmented and virtual reality. Apple Inc. hasn’t revealed any plans for AR, but CEO Tim Cook has touted the technology publicly multiple times. It’s unlikely Apple would allow Google’s Tango to operate on its iPhones.\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. is certainly thinking about virtual reality shopping too, said Mr. Chute, the IDC analyst.\n\nAll these companies, however, must grapple with the dual challenge of mastering the necessary tech and, more critically, finding an actual market.\n\n“Hardware ain’t easy,” Mr. Chute said. “What works in a closed environment, in (Silicon) Valley, doesn’t necessarily work in the real world.”\n\nReport Typo/Error" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1374289772727273, 0.09777268862090291 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3764001623376624, 0.5060180890538034 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-01-05T06:47:57.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-05T17:01:37.000+0000" } ] }

The day after Christmas, he drove the 165 miles from his home in Springfield, Missouri, to check it out. By February 1, he had settled into his new house. By February 4, he was connected to the network.\n\nThat was exactly what officials had wanted. When the area (first Kansas City, Kansas, with Kansas City, Missouri added weeks later) won a challenge to be the first to get Google Fiber, local boosters celebrated, hoping to kickstart an economic renaissance: attracting entrepreneurs, cultivating emerging business districts, and becoming known as a major startup hub.\n\nSchatz in his home office. Photographer: Barrett Emke/Bloomberg\n\nFour years later, Schatz’s company Sportsphotos.com, which takes photos of amateur sporting events around the country, is growing slowly. He’s taking full advantage of the speedy internet, uploading hundreds of high-resolution photos in minutes from races and other matches. But the business isn’t yet where he wants it to be, and for now Schatz’s main source of income is web development work and renting out rooms in his home on Airbnb. On a recent Sunday, Schatz sat in his home, where he also operates his company, pecking away at a desktop, surrounded by pizza boxes. “I thought we would be huge already,” he said.\n\nSchatz’s disappointment is a tale of misplaced expectations, by both entrepreneurs and city leaders. (The challenges that he and other startup founders face is the subject of the latest episode of the Decrypted podcast; subscribe here on iTunes.) In 2011 the cities’ two mayors called Fiber’s then-future deployment “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” and a way to “spark economic development.” And for Google, which since significantly has pared down support for the project, it was a case of placing too much faith in the ability of its own technology to change lives.\n\nIt’s also been hard for the Kansas City area to become the boom town that leaders dreamed of. Some entrepreneurs, like Schatz, were drawn to the city because of the fiber, and some launched businesses. A “startup village” sprang up. But few of the companies really took off, and some frustrated founders ended up decamping to San Francisco, where there was a larger talent pool and greater access to capital. Even the best of intentions and super-speedy internet isn’t enough to create a new Silicon Valley.\n\nEvery year after Alphabet Inc.’s Google’s first fiber connections lit up in late 2012, greater Kansas City’s GDP growth has fallen well short of the national average. In 2015, it was just 1.5%, compared to 2.6% for the nation as a whole. Metro regional numbers aren’t yet available for all of 2016, although based on state numbers through the third quarter, both Kansas and Missouri seem to be beating the national average.\n\n“We’re scratching our heads a little bit,” said Jeff Pinkerton of the Mid America Regional Council, a nonprofit that conducts economic research for greater Kansas City. “Why is Kansas City really not taking off, especially with this asset like Google Fiber?”\n\nGoogle came to town in 2011. At Wyandotte High School auditorium, on the Kansas side, blue, red, yellow and green spotlights shone on a parade of dignitaries who addressed the audience. Google founder Sergey Brin spoke on a prerecorded video. After the announcement about fiber going into Kansas City, a Google vice president invited the crowd to a barbecue-laden celebration.\n\nKansas City beat out more than 1,000 other cities for the debut Google fiber project, which aimed to compete against the telecommunications and cable giants that have dominated the market for Internet access. Some analysts believed the ultimate goal was to encourage those competitors to improve their own services and thus the Internet experience overall, which would bolster the environment for Alphabet’s most lucrative business: online search.\n\nA fiber connection box in the basement of a home in the Startup Village.

The group released a plan in 2012 that made recommendations ranging from nurturing technology districts to supporting tax credits for small technology businesses to creating mentor networks.\n\nDespite budget challenges, the state of Kansas has stuck by a preexisting income tax credit of up to $50,000 for angel backers who invest in a young company. Working with a group called Techstars, Kansas City-based Sprint Corp. created an incubator for startups. The Kauffman Foundation, a think tank based in Kansas City, Mo., started a weekly gathering for entrepreneurs.\n\nAn area straddling State Line Road, the border, became the first neighborhood that Google wired for fiber, and a community of founders sprang up. The district, which had zoning laws that made it easier to run a business from home, became known as Startup Village. That’s where Schatz, the owner of Sportsphotos.com, moved into a rental house.\n\nIt was an online video about the Kansas City experiment that drew him. He realized that Google Fiber could be the key to his nascent business: Batches of photos that took 40 to 50 hours to upload would be done in less than one. “It’s a little nerdy, to see this video and be all kinds of inspired,” says Schatz, 34, a boyish looking former U.S. army sergeant whose tours of duty included Bosnia. “But I was inspired.”\n\nYet in practice, a dazzling Internet connection didn’t mean much for some businesses. Mike Farmer operated his startup, Leap, a search engine, out of a Startup Village house for a while. “What do you do with gigabit speed that makes the experience more relevant?” he recalls asking his team. They goofed around with ideas, such as having search results take the form of several high-definition Netflix movies streaming at the same time. Given that most users wouldn’t have gigabit Internet, Leap never did find the right scenario. Farmer wound down the business last year.\n\n“The true power of Google fiber is exposure,” says Matthew Marcus, executive director of the Kansas City Startup Foundation and co-leader of the Startup Village, referring to the publicity the technology brought to the city’s startup community. “The fact is, it’s really difficult to consume one gigabit of speed.”\n\nOustide the Village Square coworking studio located within the Kansas City Startup Village. Photographer: Barrett Emke/Bloomberg\n\nSome startups have contended with the lack of access to a big talent pool. Tech companies in Silicon Valley, Waterloo, Canada, and New York City, tend to hire from nearby universities with strong software-engineering programs. The schools with the strongest engineering schools in the region are more than two hours away from Kansas City, though.Funding has also been a problem in Kansas City. Entrepreneurs lamented that local investors looked for the type of traction that would merit tens of millions of dollars from Silicon Valley venture firms. But if businesses achieve that, Midwestern venture firms invest just single-digit millions. Lack of access to capital contributed to the departure of two promising Kansas City startups, bond marketplace Neighborly and green-homebuilder Acre, which both moved most operations to Silicon Valley.\n\n“There are plenty of angels that will write $50,000 checks, but there’s not that much bridge,” says Sandy Kemper, chief executive officer of Fairway, Kansas-based C2FO, a working-capital finance company he founded in 2008. Kemper turned to big investors outside Kansas City, including San Francisco’s Mithril Capital and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, for most of his backing. In his hometown, “there is a finer filter, and maybe a little bit higher hurdle.”\n\nOne advantage cited by many local entrepreneurs, low costs, can actually backfire. “It might be a misplaced sense of comfort,” says Ajay Royan, the general partner at Mithril Capital who invested in C2FO. He believes the best entrepreneurs work with an intensity driven by the reality of global competition—a reality too easily lost sight of in a low-pressure, low-cost environment. “If you get comfortable with the fact that things seem to be going well in Kansas City,” he says, and don’t think beyond it, “that’s bad.”\n\nC2FO is one many other entrepreneurs hope will eventually list on a public market and raise hundreds of millions of dollars, with a valuation north of a billion. It has already raised $99 million and is used by some of the world’s biggest companies, including Acer, Costco, BNSF Railway, and Pfizer. That type of public offering, more than anything, would truly foster entrepreneurship in Kansas City, entrepreneurs say. It would show existing investors the upside of investing more than a few thousand dollars in startups, along with creating a class of richly rewarded early employees who would in turn likely become investors in other startups—or founders of their own.\n\nLance LeMay, a venture capitalist at Kansas City, Missouri-based Open Air Equity Partners who invested in Kemper’s and Farmer’s companies, said boosting the venture-backed startup ecosystem in Kansas City won’t even take that much. “More than a billion-dollar exit, you need lots of successful exits,” he said. “You don’t need a home run. You need lots of doubles.”\n\nMarcus (center left) of the Kansas City Startup Foundation. Photographer: Barrett Emke/Bloomberg\n\nIn the years that Kansas City has been trying to make the most out of Fiber, Google has been doing the same. In early days, company executives talked it up, with executive chairman Eric Schmidt telling conference goers in late 2012 that of all the company’s current innovations, including self-driving cars, it was Google’s “most compelling on many levels,” something that “changes your life.” Shortly afterward, it started announcing more cities for the project, beginning with Austin, Texas, and Provo, Utah. In 2013, the company recruited Craig Barratt, a wireless chip industry veteran, to lead the group that included Fiber. In 2015, when Google became Alphabet, Barratt was given the title of CEO. Over time, Google Fiber announced it would expand into 21 cities.\n\nBut just as Kansas City might have overestimated the asset Google Fiber could become, Google overestimated Fiber’s impact, and its expansion plans deflated. Barratt left in October 2016, surprising many employees. The same day, the unit announced it was stalling expansion plans in eight cities and cutting 9 percent of its staff. This month, Alphabet hired Barratt’s replacement, broadband executive Gregory McCray, and further slimmed Fiber, shifting hundreds of its employees over to Google’s core Internet business.\n\nFiber is now in only nine locations, including Atlanta and Orange County, Calif. Other Bets, the part of Alphabet that Google Fiber belongs to, reported losses of $3.58 billion last year on revenue of $809 million. It also contributed to Other Bets’ $1.39 billion in capital expenditures.\n\nA number of factors lay behind Fiber’s strategic shift. Former employees said a chief reason was the discrepancy between the desires of Google's co-founders to expand the service and make it faster and the demanding costs of providing it. Cable incumbents moved aggressively, introducing similar high-speed services at low prices. Unexpected political hurdles emerged. In Louisville, Kentucky, for instance, AT&T and Charter Communications sued the municipality over a wonky utility ordinance that would ease Google Fiber’s installation.\n\n“Google invested in Fiber during a time when it was willing to make lots of big investments with uncertain or long-term returns, but over the last couple of years Google has become a different place,” says Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. “It doesn’t necessarily make sense for Alphabet to continue to invest in it as heavily at this point.”\n\nCustomer Paul Rogers uses the Wi-Fi at the Google Fiber Space in Kansas City. Photographer: Barrett Emke/Bloomberg\n\nSchatz recently changed his business model. Instead of getting amateur athletes to pay for the photos, they download them for free, with sponsorship fees providing his revenue. Having observed the reluctance of local investors to back companies that lack strong income, he is working to build relationships with big sports retailers and fitness companies that could sponsor the blanket photography of the events he shoots.\n\nThe race-photography business alone is worth $20 to $50 million annually a year on sponsorships, he calculates; add in other amateur sports and expanded marketing initiatives and it could be exponentially more. But for now, he’s capturing just a tiny portion; revenue last year doubled but was still under $100,000, he says. This year, he hopes to keep growing and achieve profitability.\n\nHe knows developing ties to potential sponsors would be much easier in a city like New York or Los Angeles, but he believes he can pull it off from the heartland.\n\nSometimes, he thinks back to advice a venture capitalist gave him a few years ago, to drop everything else and focus only on his business. The laid-back atmosphere in Kansas City made it easier to put that advice aside, he says.\n\n“It probably would have been good to have extra pressure,” he says now. Still, he says perks such as a community of fellow entrepreneurs make him happy he stayed put.\n\nA representative welcomes visitors. Photographer: Barrett Emke/Bloomberg\n\nMeanwhile, some of the original startup supporters in Startup Village have sold their real estate to non-entrepreneurs.\n\nAfter Google Fiber came to town, Brad Feld, a venture capitalist at Boulder, Colo.-based Foundry Group bought a bungalow in Startup Village for use, gratis, by a promising young company. For a time, Leap’s Farmer housed interns there. Today, a start-up engineer lives in the house. On a recent visit, a layer of dark fuzz and grime obscured floors. A vacuum cleaner stood at the far end of the main room, plugged in but apparently unused. A side room lacked furniture, but did sport a large pile of clothing flung in its center.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nSebastian gleaned new insights into holiday e-commerce trends from the conference call, recognizing these trends point to post-election weakness recovery thanks to robust Cyber-Five growth coupled with mobile traffic. For context, the “Cyber Five” period is the time frame following Thanksgiving through December to-date. Commentary shines the most for Amazon and Facebook, and is “mildly positive” for eBay and Alphabet.\n\nColin Sebastian has a very good TipRanks score with a 68% success rate and he stands at #37 out of 4,283 analysts. Sebastian garners 14.5% in his annual returns. When recommending AMZN, Sebastian earns 32.8% in average profits on the stock. When suggesting FB, Sebastian realizes 18.4%. When rating EBAY, Sebastian yields 11.6%. When advising GOOGL, Sebastian gains 15.3%.\n\nLet’s dive in:\n\nAmazon’s Competitive Edge Likely to Rise\n\nAmazon appears to be in a “strong” position based upon Sebastian’s conversation with Cobb of eBags. Leading him to reiterate an Outperform rating on shares of AMZN with an $850 price target, which represents a just under 10% increase from current levels.\n\nIn fact, the analyst notes that from Cobb’s viewpoint, Amazon rivals its competitor eBay in the spectrum of mobile experience, asserting, “In particular, Mr. Cobb believes that eBay’s mobile experience lags Amazon, as it requires customers to manually sort through a larger number of search results.”\n\nHowever, Sebastian bears in mind, “As Amazon continues to build out private brands across multiple categories, merchants and brands may become increasingly cautious in selling on the platform. While Amazon continues to generate significant order volumes, we note that sellers may, over time, seek out alternative marketplaces and/or develop and nurture their own online retail sites and apps.”\n\n“In the event of another recession, Amazon will likely see its growth reduced again; however, longer term downturns typically increase Amazon’s competitiveness as weaker competitors may be forced out of business or have less capital flexibility to make long-term investments,” the analyst surmises.\n\nTipRanks analytics exhibit AMZN as a Strong Buy. Out of 34 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 32 are bullish on Amazon while 2 remain sidelined. With a return potential of nearly 23%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $950.19.\n\nFacebook is a King of Advertising Spend- Thanks to Mobile and Video\n\nFacebook and Alphabet were among two of the shining lights of the conference call, thanks to domination of ad spend on back of driving forces in mobile and video. Accordingly, the analyst reiterates an Outperform rating on FB without listing a price target.\n\nSebastian accentuates, “Mobile traffic continues to improve and drive an increasing share of visits and engagement, as expected, with merchants allocating larger portions of their advertising budgets to mobile and mobile video despite the lower conversion rates vs. desktop ads. Both executives mentioned video as an increasingly important format to engage with consumers.”\n\nFurthermore, the analyst opines, “With respect to customer acquisition, Google and Facebook are still dominating advertising spend, with mobile video on Facebook emerging this holiday as a new driver of engagement and sales. Separately, eBay CEO Devin Wenig tweeted mobile GMB (gross merchandise bought) share vs. desktop reached 38% on Thanksgiving (up from 35% in 2015), suggesting the growth in mobile traffic has more than offset the related decrease in average order value.”\n\nHowever, with reigning clout also comes the careful watch of government authorities. “Facebook has achieved overwhelming dominance in the bulk of its key markets and consequently is likely to face increased scrutiny from the DOJ, the EU, and other government watchdogs,” Sebastian concludes, positive on the social media giant, but aware of impending risks.\n\nTipRanks analytics indicate FB as a Strong Buy. Based on 38 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 35 rate a Buy on FB while 3 maintain a Hold. The 12-month average price target stands at $157.71, marking a 32% upside from where the stock is currently trading.\n\neBay’s Potential Lies in Forthcoming Platform Updates\n\nWhereas Cobbs of eBags sees weakness in eBay, Insley of Quick Ship Brands sees the company as “healthy and improving, and Sebastian tends to agree. The analyst reiterates an Outperform rating on shares of EBAY with a $35 price target, which represents a close to 20% increase from current levels.\n\nSebastian underscores a general sense of positivity surrounding the platform, as he believes, “Overall, commentary around the planned updates to eBay’s platform seemed optimistic, as merchants and brands anticipate better organic search visibility as a result of improved product/category indexing. In particular, Mr. Cobb believes that eBay’s mobile experience lags Amazon, as it requires customers to manually sort through a larger number of search results. As eBay structured data initiatives progress through 2017, he expects to see better product visibility from both an SEO and on-site search standpoint, giving customers more relevant results and alleviating some of the biggest challenges for marketplace sellers.\n\n“eBay has previously disclosed that the marketplace hosts over a billion live product listings, and many sellers find it difficult to stand out, particularly in crowded product categories. By introducing improved sorting and filtering tools, eBay will seek to streamline the shopping experience for customers while giving sellers greater product exposure,” the analyst contends, anticipating that enhanced customer mobile experience will bode well for the e-commerce and online auction giant.\n\nTipRanks analytics demonstrate EBAY as a Buy. Out of 23 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 9 are bullish on eBay stock, 11 remain sidelined, and 3 are bearish on the stock. With a return potential of nearly 14%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $33.21.\n\nAlphabet’s Big Threat: Facebook\n\nGoogle, much like Facebook, has made great strides in mobile and video, with robust growth in Search, a key to winning in both mobile advertising as well as customer acquisition, which are on a surge in expectation of rising volumes.\n\nTherefore, the analyst picks Alphabet as his fourth bullish call, reiterating an Outperform rating on GOOGL without listing a price target.\n\nHowever, like Facebook, Sebastian is wary that success will bear anti-trust and regulatory-related risks, warning, “As Google’s dominance has grown in Search, the DOJ has increased scrutiny of the company’s activities. This may hamper Google’s competitiveness in the future.”\n\nMoreover, Facebook remains a viable threat to Alphabet, as Sebastian predicts “Facebook may also, over time, compete in search, by using its social network data to augment a search index compiled of public web data.” Additionally, “It is possible that Facebook will launch a third-party Display Network to compete with Google’s network, and thereby take market share,” the analyst adds.\n\nOverall, though Sebastian nonetheless maintains buying opportunity is still compelling for GOOGL, he remains more confident on Facebook in the long-term.\n\nTipRanks analytics show GOOGL as a Strong Buy. Based on 28 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 26 rate a Buy on GOOGL, 1 maintains a Hold, while 1 issues a Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $968.33, marking a 19% upside from where the stock is currently trading." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1413862024500323 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4788652482269505 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-20T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

The new products, Watch Sport and Watch Style will be introduced on Feb 9 alongside other anticipated updates. Rumor has it that the Smartwatches will be powered by the latest version of Android Wear, which is also slated to become available next month. Further claims indicate that Google has been working with LG, efforts that have resulted in the launch of the first ever Smartwatches.\n\nApparently, there has been mixed excitement about Smartwatches and a majority are of the opinion that the 2.0 might just be the savior. Notable features of the LG Smartwatches according to VentureBeat include Google Assistant integration.\n\nMore in terms of features\n\nEach of the models has unique features the likes of a circular 1.2-inch 360×360 pixel display, 512MB of RAM and 240mAh battery for the Watch Style and 1.38-inch 480×480 screen, 768MB of RAM and a 430mAh battery for the Watch Sport.\n\nIn addition, they will both sport built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, features that will facilitate navigation in a similar way to Apple’s iWatch. They will be able to accommodate 4GB of storage.\n\nLaunch of Wear 2.0 delayed by redesigning of OS\n\nThe Android Wear market has been stagnant for a couple of months now. A majority of vendors have been shying away from new products due to the dominance of the older smart watches as well as a lukewarm market. However, the launch of 2.0 would not have come any earlier because on response to the developer’s comments, the need to redesign its OS arose.\n\nNonetheless, a caption on the Wear 2.0 web page states, “Get ready for the next version of Android Wear!

(GOOG) has presented a rich pool of technical data in recent sessions. These are the trends we’ve been tracking and how we feel they should be played in the current environment. The best way to gauge the future price movement of a stock is to look at historical chart data and map a course for the future. Gathering this data is best done by combing through the technical data and a mix of indicators.\n\nRecent trading for (GOOG) has highlighted key trends upon which sound decisions can be based. The levels established for its relative 50 and 200 SMAs have suggested that the current trend is bullish. The current trend established by the SMAs also highlight the level of investor interest as the stock makes its way across varying levels of risk and upside potential. This has further created a general positive trading atmosphere. Current trends have also fed into volume levels which have seen weak buying and selling sentiments, reflecting the general indifference of interested parties across the broadest trading and investing spectrum. Combined these sentiment-based indicators and trends point to potential deeper impacts on cross-related technical factors capable of influencing overall upside.\n\nThe deeper test for the directional thrust of a stock is measured through two very important indicators: Relative strength indicator (RSI) and Stochastic measures. Both indicators offer up the distilled wisdom of whether the stock is oversold or overbought, i.e. are the sellers dominating activities, or are the buyers doping the bulk of the movement. For (GOOG) the 14-day RSI is 36.47% this indicates that on the balance of traditional RSI measures, the stock is neutral – neither overbought nor oversold and therefore not susceptible to any undue price movements in either direction. The stochastic picture offers up another powerful indicator of potential price movement for (GOOG). Stochastic data amassed over the past 30 days highlights a score of 17.84%. This indicates that the stock is oversold at current levels.\n\nLeading indicators, good as they are in predicting and signaling price movement, may not tell the whole story. When they fall short it is up to other types of indicators to help pick up the slack. Short-term movement for (GOOG) has offered up some interesting dynamics. Its -14.21 price change has produced negative change over the past 30 days. Longer term the stock has underperform the S&P 500 by -4.4%. This performance has come on the back of consistently lower daily volatility when matched against other stocks trading on the same exchange. Recent momentum has been largely informed by a historical volatility of 11.81%. This level of volatility is indicative of the speed (rate of change) of the underlying stock price and is therefore a helpful gauge at a glance. The risk-implied volatility is also being showcased via the average true range, currently 1.1. Keep in mind that ATR does not account for price direction therefore professional traders always utilize the price chart in tandem with the ATR indicator." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.09475560802833528 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3849822904368358 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-27T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

Or Alphabet Inc?", "\nReports Indicate That Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) IPhone 8 Could Be Red" ], "article_text" : [ "Will Alphabet Inc dethrone Apple Inc. ?\n\nApple may lose the 'most valuable company' tag to Alphabet .\n\n. What are the next steps for Apple to reclaim the throne?\n\nWhat is the viability factor for future iPhones?\n\nThere is plenty of reason to believe that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might lose its No. 1 market cap status to second-placed Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Apple’s market cap at the time of writing the article is $614.01 billion, while Alphabet is at $559.77 billion.\n\nIn the last twelve months, AAPL stock is only marginally up by 0.11% whereas GOOGL stock is up by 7.66%. The problem is that Apple’s revenue in 2016 declined by 8%, while Alphabet’s revenue in the first three-quarters of the year increased by 19.65%.There’s a valid reason why the positional switchover might happen. Let's take a closer look.\n\nMarket Segments and Valuations\n\nThe problem for Apple was that the bulk of their revenue, 63.4%, came from iPhone sales. With smartphone sales growth showing signs of plateauing around the world, the odds of iPhone sales picking up pace over the next few years is quite slim. Compare that to Alphabet’s continued double-digit growth and the fact that online advertising has plenty of room to grow in the future, the difference in the fortunes of both the companies is quite stark.\n\nAt this point, one might argue that the valuations of both these companies have already priced in these growth factors, as Alphabet is trading at 29 times its earnings, while Apple is trading less than half of that valuation, at 13.69 times. Clearly, Apple’s valuation looks extremely depressed compared to Alphabet’s, but so do the fortunes of the respective segments they compete in. The market can remain irrational much longer than we can remain solvent, and there is no guarantee that the situation will reverse soon.\n\nApple’s depressed valuation makes it a great buy at this price point, and the biggest factor that an investor needs to consider is the slowdown in smartphone sales. Though it might sound preposterous, the lack of growth opportunity in smartphone sales around the world is possibly the best thing that happened to Apple and its investors. This has already pushed Apple into a corner, and with smartphone penetration in developed markets at record levels, there are very few new hands left for the company to push their iPhone into. (See Also: AAPL Stock: Apple Inc. Hints At Its Next Disruptive Product )\n\nWhat Next for Apple?\n\nAs a result, Apple has certain options in front of it. The company can now shift its focus to emerging markets, where smartphone penetration is still low. Though the return might be a lot lower than what you normally see in developed markets, this will at least provide some room for growth, albeit at a lower margin level. Apple has already started pushing its low cost model iPhone SE to address this market segment, and it will continue its push in that direction.\n\nThough analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has indicated that there’s no iPhone SE refresh coming in March 2017, there’s no reason for Apple to discontinue the model. His argument is that Apple wants to maximise margins and prevent the SE from cannibalising potential iPhone 7 sales, but markets like China and India will still have room for SE sales through next year, which Apple can’t afford to let go of.\n\nNow that it is acutely aware of the state of the market in developed countries, the company has no choice but to accelerate its innovation process to make its newer models irresistible to buyers in the United States and other developed markets.\n\nIn addition, the company may want to make refresh cycles as short as possible, with the possible exception of iPhone SE for early next year. And the only way to do that is by producing better phones than ever before, which will push the company to its limits when it comes to innovation. No more incremental innovations like iPhone 7 vs iPhone 6S, because it is just not going to cut it any more. And we’re not just talking about next year’s iPhone, dubbed iPhone 8. The company must think beyond its 10th anniversary edition of the iconic smartphone.\n\nAlso Read: Apple Stock: Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Set For A Big Holiday Quarter Rally?\n\nBeyond iPhone\n\nFurthermore, as the company fights for its smartphone sales numbers, it also will scramble to build its alternate revenue streams that run through its services portfolio.\n\nCase in point is the way Apple started focusing on Apple Pay’s rollout. After the launch in October 2014, Apple Pay was available in United States and United Kingdom by the end of 2014, and then added Canada and Australia in 2015.\n\nBut in 2016 when the smartphone sales slowdown shocked the company, Apple Pay was rolled out in China, Singapore, Switzerland, France, Hong Kong, Russia, New Zealand, Japan and Spain. That’s nearly nine countries in twelve months, and it's clear that a lot more will be added in the next twelve months.\n\nApple’s services revenue was the only bright spot in the company’s financial reports last fiscal, growing by 22% from $19.909 billion last year to $24.348 billion. It still accounts for little more than ten percent of their overall revenues, but a proper ecosystem that can add value to its loyal customers will go a long way in keeping those customers inside Apple’s world, eventually making sure that the company’s moat is as good as it can be.\n\nThe Edge Remains\n\nNow throw in the fact that Apple captured nearly 91% of the smartphone industry’s profits in 2015, it’s amply clear that a lot of companies that are selling smartphones today won't be around five years from now.\n\nApple has a cash generating machine in the iPhone, and the innovation and applications that it brings to the table will be unbeatable in the market, creating a huge lead for the company over time. If such a company is selling at 13 times earnings, the best play would be to add them to your portfolio because the market hasn’t valued these strengths into its current pricing, which seems to reflect the current revenue growth rate and not the inherent strength of the company that will serve them well over the years.\n\nLooking to invest in technology companies?

This is according to a Japanese blog which has a decent record in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) scoops. The iPhone 8 is expected to be launched next year around September when Apple traditionally launches new products. The new iPhone color would be an addition to the ones that already exist including silver, black, gold, jet black and rose gold. Besides the new bold color, the Japanese blog also added that the new iPhone would sport a new processor, the A11 chip.\n\nInformation That the IPhone 8 Could Be Red Leaked by Supplier\n\nThe Japanese blog indicated that its source of information was a supplier based in Taiwan. The blog went on to say that the next iPhone was not the iPhone 8 but iterations of iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7. Rival Apple news sites added to the confusion by saying there would be three iPhones released in the coming year. This would be the iPhone 7, the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 8.\n\nRumors on how the next iPhone will look like have been increasing by the day as the iconic smartphone nears its tenth year of existence. Among the unconfirmed rumors, besides that the iPhone 8 could be red in color, is the fact that the iPhone 8 would no longer be having the Home button but the functionality would instead be placed at the rear of the phone or under the screen. Equally, it has also been rumored that the display area in the new iPhone would cover the entire front of the phone.\n\nCurved Display\n\nThere have also been other rumors suggesting that the next iPhone, or at least one of the versions, would have an OLED display. Other features that have been speculated about include capabilities for wireless charging.\n\nAdding strength to the rumors is the fact that for a long time now, Apple has been relying on incremental changes to the iPhone and it now needs to do something revolutionary in order to enjoy sales figures that would rival those of the first few generations of the iPhone. this will require doing more than offering more colors, like the rumors that the iPhone 8 could be red suggest.\n\nApple Inc fell 0.57% in Monday’s trading to close at $113.30 a share." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1177717652717653, 0.07874579124579123 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3891902267828193, 0.330155723905724 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-13T04:50:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2016-12-13T14:34:58.000+0000" } ] }

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) plans to roll out “Instant Tethering” along with Google Play Services 10.2. Users who have already received the new addition said that this has allowed them to connect to devices using the same Google account without a connection, which is, in a way, the evolution of Wi-Fi hotspot.\n\nUsers will no longer need to turn on Wi-FI hotspot by touching the phone; things would be easier thanks to Instant Tethering. With one main Google account, users would be able to connect easily to other devices. The feature will work via Bluetooth; if users are not able to log onto Wi-Fi, a pop-up will automatically show up which will ask them if they would like to back online through their cellular Internet connection. With one tap on the connect button, they will be able to use the Internet on any other device around them.\n\nInstant tethering will not need additional information from users to set up. Unluckily, this handy feature is not available for all Android users at the moment. In some cases, it might not even appear if users do not have the updated version of Google Play Services. Owners of the tech giant’s Pixel and Nexus phones can enjoy this feature, which are running the latest version of Android Nougat 7.1.1. as it will first come to those devices.\n\nKeep your fingers crossed as this feature might just come to other Android-powered devices and the company does not keep it exclusive to its house products. Andreas Proschofsky, Editor at German publication derstandard.at made a post on Google+ which read: “Google Play Services 10.2 has started to roll out and it’s introducing a pretty nifty new feature: Instant tethering.

In his updated research note issued to investors on Thursday, March 24, the analyst stated that he sees a minimal near-term impact on the company from the event. Regardless of this positivity, Google shares traded in green on Thursday, declining 1.19% during active trading.\n\nAccording to Mr. Mahaney, the recent headline is negative which would upset most brands. However, he believes that the potential impact on revenues and earnings per share (EPS) is minimal. Consequently, the analyst and his team maintained an Outperform rating on Google shares. They also reiterated a price target of $1,025 on the company’s stock, which represents 22% upside from the current stock levels.\n\nIn his research note, Mark further highlighted assumptions for maintaining his estimates. According to him, YouTube is likely to contribute about $14 billion of revenue in the fiscal year 2017 (FY17) whereas Google Display Networks is expected to provide roughly $4.8 billion of the revenues during the same period. Moreover, GDC pays about 70% of traffic acquisition costs, and both have same net margins as the firm’s estimates for the entire organization. Based on this, a 2% hit on GDN and YT revenue would lead to 0.3% decline on estimates, totaling to $309 million revenue and $0.12 EPS reduction. In contrast, a 10% hit would result in 1.7% decline in estimates, resulting in $1.5 billion revenue and $0.59 EPS reduction.\n\nAlphabet’s 12-month average price target stands at $985.73, implying more than 15% upside potential over the previous price.

(AMZN ..." ], "article_text" : [ "Let’s talk about F.A.N.G a.k.a. four of the internet most popular stocks: Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). Canaccord analyst Michael Graham has been out with a mostly positive forecast for the quarter. However, on three of the four, the analyst reigned in the price target on stocks he has nonetheless hailed as “beacons of growth.”\n\nThe big four were all down in market trading on Wednesday afternoon. Even so, the analyst is riding the bullish train for the long-term as he sees these stocks as leaders of the large-cap tech-verse, particularly considering that “three of the FANGs comprise half of the six fast-growing large-cap tech stocks.”\n\nWhat are the drivers for these tech giants in terms of growth? Graham cites four crucial wave makers: digital advertising, digital video consumption, eCommerce, and cloud services. From where the analyst is standing, the drivers remain “very much intact” and therefore, growth should sustain, and as revenue growth continues to be steady, “investors keep returning.”\n\nAs far as Graham sizes up Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google, he asserts, “The FANG stocks have had two very strong years, outperforming the market by a wide margin. The stocks had a more mixed Q3, with more diverse performance following earnings, and a group-wide (short-lived) selloff following President-elect Trump’s victory. We still think these stocks will perform well through 2017, although we recommend fine-tuning relative exposure within the group based on your time horizon.”\n\nWhy should you trust Graham’s opinion? According to TipRanks, five-star analyst Michael Graham is ranked #241 out of 4,243 analysts. Graham has a 52% success rate and garners 8.6% in his annual returns. When recommending FB, Graham earns 22.9% in average profits on the stock. When suggesting AMZN, Graham gains 7.1%. When rating NFLX, Graham realizes 20.1%. When advising GOOGL, Graham yields 14.0%.\n\nLet’s explore the stocks that make up the crux of the tech court:\n\nFacebook Global User Base Still Growing by 15%- Impressive\n\nWith regards to Facebook, Graham sees the social media titan facing the greatest impact now that companies, investors, and regulators alike are choosing to shift focus from non-GAAP to GAAP metrics.\n\nEven so, the analyst advises to buy in light of the titan’s “multi-faceted revenue growth story” which features a well-rounded arc of users, engagement, ad load, ad pricing, as well as newer services.\n\nWhile there are a couple of risks, from ad load warnings to near-term concerns from advertisers who might be wary of issues with measurement, Graham reiterates a Buy on FB while trimming the price target from $160 to $150, which represents a close to 30% increase from where the shares last closed.\n\nMeanwhile, advertisers are corralling to the platform, to the tune of 4 million as of third-quarter, thanks to global user and monthly active user (MAU) growth as well as some enhanced engagement with “dramatic” possibilities to gain further abroad.\n\nThe analyst opines, “We dusted off our 2013 initiation report on FB in which we estimated 2017 ad revenue at $17.6B. Our current estimate for next year is more than double that number at $37.5B, and while we are patting ourselves on the back with one hand for recommending this juggernaut for 3+ years, with the other hand we are scratching our head trying to figure out how we so dramatically underestimated FB’s potential.”\n\nUltimately, “Investors seem to still be largely focused on revenue for FB, and we continue to be comfortable with the outlook. We are modeling 35% ad revenue growth in 2017, down from 61% in 2016, and we believe this should be easily achievable given the multiple drivers,” Graham surmises.\n\nTipRanks analytics exhibit FB as a Strong Buy. Out of 38 analysts polled in the last 3 months by TipRanks, 35 are bullish on Facebook stock, while 3 remain sidelined. With a return potential of 37%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $158.03.\n\nAmazon Prime Flywheel Presents Buying Opportunity\n\nAs the Amazon Prime flywheel fires up eCommerce growth rates and surges in scale and volume drive increases in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Graham likes the prospects for a “manageable competitive environment.”\n\nTherefore, despite awareness of margin pressure and a “price war” brewing for AWS that could prominently shake up margins, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of AMZN while pulling back on the price target from $900 to $875, which represents a just under 18% increase from current levels.\n\nAs the analyst deduces, “Steady growth in eCommerce revenue has been largely taken for granted by investors over the last couple of years, and this is even more true so far in 2016, when eCommerce revenue growth both internationally and domestically has stayed above 26%. This has been the result of excellent execution around selection, price, and fulfillment. More recently, however, management commentary has centered on the ‘Prime Flywheel’ which involves even faster, free shipping and a variety of other services (‘free shipping with Netflix and Spotify thrown in for free…’).”\n\nGuesstimating two-thirds of eCommerce revenue for the online auction and e-commerce leader likely stems from the U.S. coupled with 65% of Prime members, or roughly 43.5 million, in the U.S., out of a projected total of 70 million Prime members from 350 million customer accounts, the analyst likes Amazon’s positioning.\n\n“We believe Prime is the lens through which Amazon management is viewing the company’s opportunity,” Graham postulates.\n\nTipRanks analytics demonstrate AMZN as a Strong Buy. Based on 35 analysts polled in the last 3 months by TipRanks, 33 rate a Buy on AMZN, while 2 maintain a Hold. The 12-month average price target stands at $946.39, marking a 27% upside from where the stock is currently trading.\n\nNetflix: One-Two Punch of Original Content Value and International Expansion Possibility\n\nMeanwhile, Graham commends Netflix for its substantial runway ahead in terms of potential development internationally and sees the streaming giant’s original content as key, comparing its importance to the likes of fulfillment for Amazon.\n\nAs such, amid concerns of competition, subscriber comp challenges awaiting the first half of 2017, and deficient support for valuation in the short-term, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on NFLX with a $140 price target, which represents an 18% increase from where the shares last closed.\n\nThe analyst notes, “Netflix launched in its first international market (Canada) in 2010. It then launched across most countries in Latin America in 2011 and several countries in Western Europe in 2012. We estimate that the largest single international markets by subscribers are the U.K., Canada, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, and Japan currently.”\n\nAdditionally, Graham sees, “Along with these top markets, there are several other opportunities from recent launches and emerging economies. Due to Western Europe’s mature economy and media landscape, we think these markets could ramp faster. Specifically, the Nordics, France, Spain, and Italy all seem poised for greater near-term adoption.”\n\nOverall, “We think Netflix’s international expansion is still very much in the early stages. While the top international markets are at ~12% penetration, layering in newer mature markets and some of the larger emerging one shows that Netflix is still merely in mid-single digit penetration of the total addressable market,” Graham determines.\n\nTipRanks analytics indicate NFLX as a Buy. Out of 37 analysts polled in the last 3 months by TipRanks, 20 are bullish on Netflix stock, 11 remain sidelined, and 6 are bearish on the stock. With a return potential of 5%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $123.29.\n\nAlphabet (Google): Re-Accelerating Website Revenue Key to Success\n\nAs Alphabet’s stock has been circling a 40% rise from summertime 2015, Graham is banking on the company’s ad innovation and website revenue growth as key drivers to maintain full confidence ahead. As YouTube’s evolution spirals forward and in face of prospective multiple expansion, the analyst likes the tech giant’s odds over the risk of Mobile, Programmatic, and YouTube applying pressure to gross margins.\n\nTherefore, Graham reiterates a Buy on shares of GOOGL while cutting the price target from $950 to $925, which represents a 21% increase from where the stock is currently trading.\n\nA key to GOOGL’s success lies in its website revenue growth, as the analyst explains, “We believe the most important driver of this move has been the re-acceleration of Websites revenue growth, which progressed from 13% in Q2/15 to 16% in Q3 and 20% in Q4. This important growth rate then stayed well above 20% so far this year, and this is an important psychological level for the stock.”\n\nMoreover, Graham considers, “The likely key driver of this resurgence in growth has been essentially ad load on both mobile search and YouTube (discussed below), with the company adding a third mobile search ad unit that started gaining traction in Q2/15 but really hit its stride in Q3.”\n\nUltimately, “We estimate YouTube revenue growth will decelerate from 48% in 2016 to 37% in 2017, but at ~15% of Websites revenue next year, this relatively high growth rate is an important tailwind. We estimate that YouTube will be 18% of Websites revenue in 2020. As it grows larger in the mix, its higher growth rate than search revenue should help buoy the overall top-line for many years,” Graham concludes.\n\nTipRanks analytics show GOOGL as a Strong Buy. Based on 27 analysts polled in the last 3 months by TipRanks, 26 rate a Buy on GOOGL while 1 issues a Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $968.33, marking a nearly 27% upside from where the shares last closed." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1040858353116418 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4362881348042638 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-02T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

After a recent check, the 50-day Moving Average is 844.33, the 200-day Moving Average is 800.36, and the 7-day is noted at 843.19. Moving averages have the ability to be used as a powerful indicator for technical stock analysis. Following multiple time frames using moving averages can help investors figure out where the stock has been and help determine where it may be possibly going. The simple moving average is a mathematical calculation that takes the average price (mean) for a given amount of time.\n\nTraders may be relying in part on technical stock analysis. Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -47.52. Despite the name, CCI can be used on other investment tools such as stocks. The CCI was designed to typically stay within the reading of -100 to +100. Traders may use the indicator to determine stock trends or to identify overbought/oversold conditions. A CCI reading above +100 would imply that the stock is overbought and possibly ready for a correction. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) is 26.73. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. The ADX is typically plotted along with two other directional movement indicator lines, the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one of multiple popular technical indicators created by J. Welles Wilder. Wilder introduced RSI in his book “New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems” which was published in 1978. RSI measures the magnitude and velocity of directional price movements. The data is represented graphically by fluctuating between a value of 0 and 100. The indicator is computed by using the average losses and gains of a stock over a certain time period. RSI can be used to help spot overbought or oversold conditions. An RSI reading over 70 would be considered overbought, and a reading under 30 would indicate oversold conditions.

It is time to join the tech giant and get these awesome perks. It sure does know how to keep its workers happy, although, the same cannot be said for all tech companies.\n\nIt has now become a tradition for the company to give out the latest products to employees each year, workers expected the amazing Pixel Smartphone this year. But this time, the employees received an email that informed them that this year will be a donation to charity. The tech giant has donated approximately $30 million worth of products to schools on behalf of its workers. This holiday season, the workers will be able to learn the art of simply giving.\n\nThe donations might not be a cost efficient move for Alphabet, but it does indicate a change in the company’s culture and changes with the new CFO, Ruth Porat.

Alphabet donated $30 million worth of Chromebooks, phones, and associated tech support to schools on its employees’ behalf.\n\nAlphabet likely would have spent around the same amount of money on its holiday gifts, so it's not exactly a cost-saving move.

(GOOGL): Google's Plans to Launch Two New Flagship Smartwatches ...", "\nMaybe Google Can Save the Smartwatch Market" ], "article_text" : [ "The search engine giant, Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, recently came under the limelight as it was recently reported that the company is planning the launch of two flagship smartwatches, which will be powered by the Android Wear 2.0, during the first of 2017. The news has ignited excitement among the users as many were desperately waiting for the tech mammoth to introduce new variants of smartwatches.\n\nThe recent move by the search engine giant indicates it is pretty serious towards achieving its market ventures in the smart watch industry. Several rumors had been floating in the tech space that the smartwatch industry is slowly losing its demand, but the latest confirmation made by the search engine giant about its upcoming launch seems to be a part of the company's effort to convince users that the smartwatches are still in demand.\n\nMoreover, the company's upcoming smartwatch will not have Pixel or Google branding but will be branded by the firm that is manufacturing them. According to Android Wear's product manager at Google, Jeff Change, Google has partnered up with a manufacturer. However, he refused to reveal the name of the manufacturing company but said that it had manufactured smartwatches in the past.\n\nMany reports indicate that the search engine giant is planning to integrate innovative features such as Android Pay and Google Assistant in the smartwatch in a bid to entice users to purchase the device. Also, it is pertinent to mention that the company is planning to roll out the final developer preview of Android Wear 2.0 as early as next month, and it is expected to include support for both Android Pay and Google Assistant.\n\nIn any case, it wouldn't be wrong to say that the tech mammoth is making all its efforts to acquire an upper hand over its rivals and increase its market share in the smartwatch industry.", "I wouldn't go so far as to say that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has failed in catalyzing the smartwatch market over the past year and a half, but I also wouldn't say that Apple Watch has been a blockbuster success. Sure, Apple Watch is easily the most successful smartwatch to date, but that doesn't actually say a whole lot since it's one of the first wearable devices in the nascent category. There isn't much competition to begin with.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) technically beat Apple by a few months, with Android Wear devices becoming available in late 2014. Since then, Apple has taken over and Android Wear has hit a wall. The search giant just re-acqui-hired some smartwatch engineers in preparation of its big 2017 push, as Android Wear 2.0 was recently delayed until next year amid lack of hardware partners. Meanwhile, just days after Google unveiled the Pixel, the first smartphone that it fully designed, rumors surfaced that the search giant was working on its own flagship smartwatches.\n\nIt turns out those rumors were at least partially true.\n\nA tale of two flagship smartwatches\n\nIn an exclusive interview yesterday with The Verge, Android Wear product manager Jeff Chang confirmed that the company has two flagship smartwatches in the pipeline for the first quarter. The wearable pair will be the first devices to run Android Wear 2.0. Despite the smartwatch market's recent hesitation, Google still wants to show consumers that smartwatches are viable products that can add value to people's lives. Simply put, Google wants to save the smartwatch market.\n\nHowever, Google isn't designing the smartwatches entirely by itself, nor is it manufacturing them. Instead, Google is taking the same approach that it did with the Nexus phones of yore, where it collaborates with a third-party original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to develop the devices, which will primarily carry that OEM's brand. Chang declined to specify which OEM it is partnering with, beyond noting that it is a current Android Wear partner. That's a sprawling list, but more than likely it'll be one of the familiar Android OEMs like Huawei, Samsung, LG, or Motorola, among a few other candidates. Notably, HTC has not released an Android Wear device (yet), so although it is manufacturing the Pixel, we can safely rule out the Taiwanese company.\n\n2017: The year of the smartwatch?\n\nThe key to unlocking the smartwatch market's potential will be to empower devices for general purposes. Thus far, manufacturers have focused heavily on fitness functionalities, given wearables' natural applications for tracking activity metrics. Whether or not Android Wear 2.0 can deliver this remains to be seen, although it has potential. The major headliners of the update will be stand-alone apps, additional user customizations, and requisites like messaging and notifications.\n\nWhile Google can't singlehandedly save the smartwatch market, the subsequent and persistent competition will inevitably improve all products within the category, and that may do the trick." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.02383271490414348, 0.1304315476190476 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.5677643784786642, 0.5000779478458049 ], "publish_date" : [ null, { "$date" : "2016-12-23T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

(GOOG) And Its Technical Chart Creates A Compelling Picture" ], "article_text" : [ "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has created a compelling message for traders in the most recent trading. That message has grown stronger as the technical chart setup has developed into a more composite picture for the stock. This is the breakdown as we see it. There’s only one thing better than one tool when trading stocks and that is two tools. For many trading is all about fundamentals – their one tool to rule them all. But people in this camp miss out when they ignore the power of technical charts. Use them in in addition to the fundamentals, and you become near-unstoppable.\n\nThe 50 and 200 SMAs for GOOG have created a marked trend which is now helping traders to make solid decisions regarding the stock. It’s a trend that is now unmistakable. Based on the trend levels presented by both indicators, the overall sentiment towards GOOG is best described as bullish. This trend has created a unified opinion across the trading floor and it is clear that the overall outlook for the stock is now established as positive. But it’s not just the outlook that’s being affected for the stock. Thanks to the consolidated opinion on GOOG, activity has also seen a pronounced trend. Under current sentiments the volume activity and subsequent trend has created a weak outlook from buyers and sellers. For traders that have invested emotionally in the outcomes surrounding GOOG, the current trend being solidified is somewhat telling. It is unsurprising in the case of GOOG, that the current trend has created some indifference among traders regarding the stock. In terms of consistency, it is clear that both the 50 and 200 SMAs have done their job in bring traders the overall trend-picture currently being seen for GOOG.\n\nThere is of course more to the tale than just what the SMAs have presented. For those added details, we can take a look at the Relative strength indicator (RSI) and Stochastic measures, both of which give deeper insights into the overall sentiment of buyers and sellers. SMAs will tell alert you to price direction, but when it comes to judging what buyers and sellers are doing, few indicators are better than RSI and the Stochastic. It as this level of technical data that a trader can determine whether a stock is currently overbought is oversold. The current picture for GOOG is of course very telling based on these two additional measures. Based on current readings, GOOG’s 14-day RSI is 47.03%. Taken on the standard scale of measurement for RSI, this suggests that GOOG is neutral, suggesting that the stock is relatively stable in terms of price movement up or down. The stochastic reading offers another solid measure of whether the stock is either overbought, or oversold. In the case of GOOG, Stochastic readings gathered over the last 30 days have created a score of 47.98%. This suggests GOOG is neither overbought or oversold at prevailing levels.\n\nIf you really want to extract the maximum information and slant from a stock, there’s really no better way than combining the above technical indicators with other more deeply ingrained technical measures. By this point in the analysis of GOOG, it is clear that other technical indicators are saying essentially the same things. Specifically the -1.17 has birthed a negative overall sentiment when measured over the previous 30 days or so of trading. Over the longer-term GOOG has underperform the S&P 500 by -3.1. This has, unsurprisingly, created lower volatility levels when compared with similar stocks of the same grade and class. Historical volatility is no less consistent. The historical volatility picture for GOOG is shown in the reading of 10.69%. GOOG has clearly shown its full hand by the overall input of these technical indicators. But there is one final measure that when added to the already rich mix, shows in full color what GOOG is doing. The indicator is the Average True Range, and based on the current 1.02 reading, GOOG is certainly worth paying attention to.\n\nGOOG couldn’t be clearer in terms of the kind of action required in light of the picture shown by its technical indicators." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.09547979797979793 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3074084595959596 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-23T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

We’ve already given you a heads up about the device’s lens flare flaw in a previous issue of Pixel’s camera, but now, numerous users have reported some peculiar problems with its camera app.\n\nA number of complaints have surfaced on Google’s product forum about the bizarre issue with Pixel’s camera app. Reports source the camera app to lock up while showing purple and pink lines all across the screen. The original thread was posted on the forum in late October, and since then, numerous such reports have flooded online forums.\n\nInitially it seemed that only the pre-installed camera app was suffering from the purple & pink lines. But now, some users have reported the same issue with third-party apps that uses camera. Reports indicated the fact that the issue was most likely caused by low connectivity of cellular service and that only international models of the Pixel family were affected.\n\nThe company and its representatives on the forum quickly responded to the issue, and provided users with some hands-on troubleshooting tricks to counter the camera issue; however, the problem still persists. A number of users have also reported that replacement devices sporting sub-par cellular connectivity faced the same problem.\n\nTo date, it is still unclear as to what is causing this bizarre issue, and how can poor connections be the reason behind it? What can be done to tackle it? And when is the fix for the camera app flaw coming? However, Google’s first and foremost responsibility has always been to cater the needs of its customers. The Country Caller believes that the search giant will soon come up with a solution.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube has launched a new feature called \"Super Chat\" which has given creators another way to make money and even fans to interact with YouTubers easily. The feature’s timing is perfect as the company announced its plan to stop monetization of videos known as “Fan Funding.” Thus, now creators have been given another way to earn money from their content.\n\nSuper Chat will allow viewers to pin a comment on live broadcasts; a dollar bill symbol will also be seen in the chat window. Users will be able to choose through a slider to select how many dollars would they like to send to the particular YouTuber they enjoy.\n\nThe more the user will pay, the more comments will get pinned. Once the payment is made, the comment will be highlighted in another color so that live streamers can flag the paid comment. In case that particular comment is pushed off the stream, creators will still be able to click through paid comments thanks to the colorful pins which will appear at the top of the window screen.\n\nSuper Chat is simply a replacement for Fan Funding which will keep creators interested in the platform. The product manager of the company, Barbara Macdonald, said that this is one way fans will be able to reach their favorite creators on the platform and vice versa. Fan Funding was launched back in 2014, through which viewers were able to make payments by choice to creators they enjoyed. Now FF will accept sign ups but will keep on working for channels that have it till the February 28, which is when it will be discontinued.\n\nThe new tool will be available in 20 countries to creators, while viewers in 40 countries will be allowed to buy Super Chat messages. Fan Funding is being discontinued because it was not used on a large scale in the first place. Hopefully Super Chat might not give the same result. The tool is for users above 18 years, who own credit cards, but kids might be able to use it if they use their parents’ credit cards.

(NASDAQ:FB) has been in the eye of storm recently due to issues like fake news and overstatement of metrics. However, advertisers are not going to flee its platform. In fact, Facebook is slowly taking the fight to industry leader Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in terms of online video viewership and advertising. New Research also shows that video content is outperforming all other types on Facebook. Here's how Facebook is edging closer to YouTube, slowly and steadily reducing its web video supremacy.\n\nFacebook Is Challenging YouTube And TV For Ads\n\nFacebook has been testing the introduction of a dedicated video tab inside its mobile app among a select group of users over the past year - a move Morgan Stanley analysts predict will help the social network capture a greater share of the TV ad market. This move will also help Facebook take on Youtube, trying to become a complete web video portal. This may also eliminate Facebook's weakness in the delivery of video content, which is still very much focused on distribution and in-feed viewing. Whereas YouTube benefits from discovery and intent.\n\nYouTube’s biggest strength is its ability to offer customers a continuous viewing experience across multiple connected devices. Facebook seems to have come up with an answer to this as well with another of their recent move. Its new feature allows live streaming of videos on your TV. 85% of videos on Facebook are watched without sound where as Youtube has a more immersive experience. YouTube thus serves as a more complete, cinematic experience than Facebook. If the new dedicated video tab becomes operational then this competitive advantage of Youtube can be reduced to a great extent.\n\nTV ad revenue in the US totaled close to $70 billion in 2015, according to PwC’s Media Outlook. Consumers continue to increase their time spent consuming digital media, which has put pressure on traditional TV ad spenders to increase their ad budgets on digital channels like Youtube and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). The dedicated video tab will solve advertisers reservations about Facebook videos being too fragmented and interspersed between feeds. So Facebook may take a huge pie of digital video advertising revenue from Youtube.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nHow Close Can FB Get To YouTube\n\nThe category YouTube belongs to is \"Google websites,\" which contributed $16.1B or 72.3% of the Google segment top-line in 3Q16. It is not clear actually how much YouTube contributes to top line figures, but it is estimated to be around $3.1B for 3Q16 by Wedbush. Youtube is expected to grow at a CAGR of 30% through 2020. However, slowly and steadily Facebook is catching up. Recently it was reported that Facebook overtook YouTube for Christmas social video campaigns in UK. 90% of all interactions and 60% of all views of Christmas TV adverts on social were via Facebook, while just under 40% of views were on YouTube, proving Facebook is where audiences head to watch and share the content they love.\n\nAlso Read: FB Stock: Facebook Inc Could Gain The Most From A Snapchat IPO In 2017\n\nIn the US alone digital video advertising is estimated to be worth $23.5B by 2020, then the global market size is much bigger. There were 3.1 Trillion Facebook video views between November 2015 and November 2016; that's a staggering increase of 94% year-on-year. With Facebook users spending an average of 50 minutes per day on the site, and over 100 million hours of daily video watch time, the reach and influence of Facebook video content is only set to increase.\n\nThough some of these numbers may not be very accurate due to Facebook's overstated metrics. Even if you go by moderate projections of these numbers, Facebook is well positioned to take on Youtube in digital video advertising space. The ever increasing market size gives these two players enough reasons to fight for.\n\nThe Next Big Digital Ad Revenue Battle Is On Videos\n\nMost of the consumer internet traffic in the future will be around video. According to a Cisco Forecast, videos will represent 69% of all consumer-based Internet traffic by 2017; this is expected to rise to 80% by 2019. Zuckerburg himself has said, “I think video is a megatrend, almost as big as mobile.”\n\nThe only place in videos where Facebook is lagging drastically is original content creation, but here it is taking the Youtube way by paying both individual celebrities and news outlets to use it. There are also recent reports of some famous content creators leaving Youtube and music industry not being happy with payments from Youtube, so Facebook has a ray of hope here as well. (See Also: FB Stock: Don't Sell Facebook Inc Stock, But Do Read This )\n\nThe US digital advertising industry will continue to experience remarkable growth through 2021 to reach nearly $100 billion in annual revenue, driven primarily by the sustained migration of ad dollars from traditional TV to digital video and the continued increase in social spending. Digital video advertising will grow faster than any other segment over the next five years, as consumers shift time spent online to phones and tablets. So we are definitely headed for a ‘war for video supremacy' going ahead.\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nIt will also be difficult to change consumers' default habit of going to YouTube for video content, but for that Facebook needs to come up with the right video offering which will entice both consumers as well as advertisers.\n\nFacebook will deliver close to $31 billion in revenue in 2017 going by a slower growth of 25% over Facebook's TTM sales number. Its sales number can shoot up drastically if it captures a sizeable chunk of the digital video ad revenue going forward and FB stock would gain from this in a big way.\n\nOffering a dedicated connected viewing and search experience is no doubt on the cards. If it can achieve this successfully and maintain its push into premium content, then Facebook may take the top spot as a complete entertainment and social hub. It's really a daunting task to go after YouTube, but the future looks bright for Facebook Inc.\n\nLooking for tech stocks?

(NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nOnline holiday sales proved to be good to these internet giants, as sales are tracking to the analyst’s growth projections of 16% to 18%. However, when looking at this week’s context of the market as a whole, the stocks underperformed.\n\nYoussef Squali has a very good TipRanks score with a 68% success rate and he stands at #27 out of 4,274 analysts. Squali garners 10.3% in his yearly returns. When recommending FB, Squali earns 24.3% in average profits on the stock. When suggesting AMZN, Squali gains 25.8%. When rating GOOGL, Squali realizes 10.2%.\n\n“While Internet stocks rose this week, the index trailed the overall market, reflecting continued rotation into Financials, Energy, Industrials and other categories positioned to benefit most from the President-elect Trump win. YTD the group remains ahead, however, up 21.2% Y/Y,” Squali notes.\n\nGlancing at the bigger picture and thanks to “the strength season-to-date,” the analyst sings the praises of these three key players in the tech sector.\n\n“We feel comfortable with our forecast for 16-18% Y/Y growth in total online sales over the holiday period and continue to view AMZN, FB and GOOGL as prime beneficiaries,” Squali contends.\n\nAs such, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of FB with a $170 price target, which represents just under a 43% increase from current levels.\n\nIn regards to Amazon, a big morsel of news was the unveiling of Amazon Go, a physical store that allows customers to shop for household items without requiring them to check out, with plans for a first store to open in Seattle at the start of 2017.\n\nThe store’s technology will maximize computer vision, sensor fusion, combined with deep learning to allow consumers to pick up and put away items in their shopping bags to carry out once ready to go, thanks to a virtual shopping cart’s tracking abilities.\n\nSquali believes, “While the concept could be potentially disruptive to retail over time, we note that Amazon plans to debut the store initially in Seattle and that a wider rollout could be some time away. We believe that Amazon will likely use this as a test location to refine the offering and gauge consumers’ responses/adoption before rolling it out on a broader basis.”\n\nMeanwhile, online sales, specifically desktop, charged forward 13% year-over-year for Cyber Week, according to comScore data.\n\n“While this is below the 15% Y/Y growth over the Thanksgiving weekend (Nov. 24-27), when the peak shopping season kicked off, it’s still 200bps above the 11% Y/Y growth pre-Thanksgiving, attesting to an elevated level of consumer spending during the peak holiday season (so far),” Squali highlights.\n\nTherefore, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on AMZN with a price target of $1,000, which represents a 30% increase from where the shares last closed.\n\nAdditionally, Squali maintains full bullish steam ahead for Alphabet after an investor conference has highlighted strides toward live television, on back of a strategic alliance with YouTube. The analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of GOOGL with a $1,040 price target, which represents a 30% increase from where the stock is currently trading.\n\n“GOOGL, AMZN take aim at traditional cable bundles.

This Seeking Alpha breaking news item from January 26, 2017, summarizes the report with a couple statistics: the earnings per share of $9.36 missed consensus expectations by $0.26. The top line, at a little over $26 billion, beat by $830 million. The market traded the stock down at the time of this news item by 1.4%.\n\nI get the trading aspect here, but I am a shareholder of Alphabet, and this doesn't impact my long-term thesis at all. Alphabet has a few important things going for it that will create value in the years ahead, making me happy to be patient and not at all discouraged by a negative reaction to Q4 (even if that negative reaction continues on in the trading sessions ahead).\n\nAlphabet: It Knows Search Technologies And How To Monetize Them\n\nSearch engines are indispensable when using the Internet as a tool of research for any topic no matter the motivation (i.e., practical versus leisure), and Alphabet's Google search engine is the blue chip in the space. The company's algorithms are sophisticated and will increase in utility over time.\n\nAlphabet has been very successful at making money from search with advertising. The Q4 press release states that the Google operating segment brought in $7.9 billion in income over the three-month period. For all of 2016, the company as a whole made $23.7 billion in operating income compared to $19.4 billion in 2015. Google search drives this company.\n\nWhy will Google grow? Mobile search will continue to be important in the coming years. It will expand as the culture remains on a post-desktop-PC course.\n\nIn addition, advertisers love how Google and its data help them make better choices in terms of targeting consumers. It's all about targeting, and search engines can deliver on this - especially Google's prime asset.\n\nAlso of note: advertisers need to reach web users. If the culture continues to use the web, then it does so at the expense of other media - this is well-known. An advertiser that wants to reach college kids may not want to advertise in a magazine or a late-night talk show. Instead, it will want to buy ads before a segment of video or on the home screen of big Internet portals. Other media are still important, but all of us are aware of how vital online properties have become in the lives of consumers.\n\nThis core search-engine asset will allow the company to engage other investment opportunities, as I will discuss in the next two sections.\n\nAlpha(other)bet(s)\n\nGoogle is key to the thesis, but Alphabet has a segment it calls Other Bets. This segment captures all the activity of the company's various experiments. For example, Google Fiber is an other bet.\n\nExperimenting with different business models is another reason to own Alphabet. There's something very important to note: in the past, the company seemed to stress (in my opinion) risk taking in this area. Today, the perception is that the company wants to be disciplined about risk. This is exactly what a shareholder wants to hear. The company isn't planning to send people to Pluto or start a subscription service called YouTube Future that shows videos of events that will happen years from now. In my opinion, management wants to stress the practical aspects of experimentation and leave it to the other guy to create the first wormhole.\n\nIn a sense, by buying Alphabet you aren't just buying a great search engine but an overall managerial attitude that will serve investors well - be creative, but be prudent, always with an eye toward keeping the stock going. This attitude also is an asset, intangible though it may be. The memo here is clear: we want to expand, but we don't want to be the place where we throw valuable money at an impractical business-model fantasy. This CNBC article serves as a source for this idea. It mentions the fiber experiment - if one reads between the lines, one might come away with the notion that management realizes the challenged potential with the concept, and is acting properly to not allow the project to take up too much of the company's resources.\n\nFuture Acquisitions\n\nPerhaps even most exciting is Alphabet's potential investment in acquisitions. There are many technologies the company will pursue in the next decade, but when you stop and think about it, probably the biggest thing that management will chase will be purchases relating to YouTube and its attempts at becoming a subscription service.\n\nYouTube is a puzzling asset: it's immensely popular, it is ad-supported, but the company wants people to directly pay for it - hence the YouTube Red service. The latter is an experiment management must continue until it gets it correct. Advertising is a useful, justifiable way of monetizing the video site, but a subscriber-based approach is more attractive - having a mix of the two models will serve Alphabet well. However, the company will need to improve this segment via acquisition.\n\nThe market may in fact be signaling this. This article over at Recode wonders about the possibility of a tech business like Alphabet buying Sony Pictures (there is a rumor that Sony may want to sell this division).\n\nAt some point, Alphabet will make a big acquisition in this area. It will help the company sell subscriptions. Revenue from subscriptions is what a company that is based on giving out much of its stuff for free wants to achieve. When a merger for a concern such as Sony Pictures occurs, it will be good for the stock. Consolidation in the media space, the marriage between tech-data and intellectual properties in this new streaming age, is a theme that a lot of pundits promote. I agree with the theme, and I know I want to continue to own Alphabet ahead of the future acquisitions it makes for its search ambitions and for its YouTube services.\n\nBig Risk: Watch Out For The Rest Of The FANG\n\nThe FANG stocks (thank you, Jim Cramer) are the risk here. FANG is Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Alphabet (i.e., G for Google).\n\nWhy do they constitute a risk? Simple: everything Alphabet wants to do they want to do. They are, in fact, doing it already. Think Facebook and Amazon don't fool around with search algorithms, or that Netflix isn't interested in the kind of data Alphabet is interested in? All of it is fair game. Who is to say Netflix won't fund its own Internet search engine once (or if) it turns extremely profitable from its own subscription service?\n\nAll of these tech companies want to do other things, explore their own other bets (maybe Netflix will one day have a show called Other Bets, about a strange tech company that funds all kinds of weird supernatural experiments; could be a sequel series to Stranger Things). They aren't sitting still, and that would be a concern to an investor.\n\nAlpha(Long-Term)bet\n\nLet's look at the following chart for Alphabet.\n\nI can't predict the future with the above graphic. That isn't my intent. The past oftentimes may not mean a whole lot.\n\nNevertheless, investors always look at the past. It's another data point, for better or for worse. To me, the trend at least tells me that the stock has been heading in the right direction and that the market seems to have confidence, to one debatable degree or another, in the company and its management team.\n\nAs I check other Seeking Alpha articles, I note the bullish sentiment. This article by D.M. Martins Research goes into helpful detail on the other-bets category - read it just for that. But I wanted to mention that the author mentions the possibility of a $1,000 stock price at some future trading date. Stone Fox Capital likewise threw that number into the discussion.\n\nSometimes a lot of agreement on a stock can be a troubling thing (if you want to see some of the cons to the latest earnings report, read this article), but I honestly believe that Alphabet shares will eventually get to this price. The combination of search, speculative investments and an eventual acquisition strategy will support the stock on such a run-up to that level.\n\nAlphabet, in my opinion, is a buy for the long-term portfolio in need of some exposure to the technology sector. As always, perform your own due diligence.", "This article first ran in Term Sheet, Fortune's daily newsletter on deals and dealmakers. Sign up here .\n\nWhen First Round Capital asked startup founders which company they most wanted to acquire their startup, they chose Alphabet more than any other company . Eleven percent of those surveyed voted for Alphabet , 5% chose Facebook, 4% chose Amazon and 4% chose Salesforce .\n\nI recently spoke with Don Harrison, who heads up corporate development at the most significant part of Alphabet – the Google part. We discussed Google’s priorities, what Alphabet’s “new austerity” means for M&A, and whether artificial intelligence (AI) startups are selling snake oil. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\nAlphabet did around 17 acquisitions in 2016 and in 2015. We didn’t see any big swings like we’ve seen in past years. What’s behind that, and should we expect more of the same this year?\n\nIn 2016, we’ll end up doing more than 20 deals. Generally speaking 2014 was a big year from a deal point of view. My team is still suffering from 2014. We generally take the same approach each year. Because we’re product-focused and product-driven, we’re reactive to the environment. When we see products or developments or large companies that are solving a problem in a new way, that drives M&A interest.\n\nWhether its cloud, AI, hardware, Google Assistant, AR, VR, I expect next year to be a lot like this [past] year. The big swings tend to be lumpy. We could at any time do one of the larger deals but it wouldn’t surprise me if there is space between them.\n\nWhich of the sectors you just named are your priorities? Your competitors have been doing a lot of AI deals…\n\n[Google CEO] Sundar [Pichai] has done a good job of bringing areas of focus too the company. We’re definitely AI first. We have been focused on that and we will continue to be. Cloud is a massive focus for us, and enterprise is an area of interest for us. With hardware and the Google Assistant– we’re looking for opportunities there. YouTube is always present for us. AR and VR continue to be investment areas.\n\nHow about valuations in AI? Is it overpriced?\n\nIt’s very hard to apply valuation metrics to AI. These acquisitions are driven by key talent -- really smart people. It’s an area I’m focused on and our team is focused on. The valuations are part and parcel of the promise of the technology. We pay attention to it but don’t necessarily worry about it.\n\nA VC recently told me that AI and machine learning PhD students from Stanford and MIT are banding together and calling themselves companies without really even having an idea or product, as a way to sell themselves in high-priced talent acquisitions. Have you seen that?\n\nThese companies are very early stage and the techniques they’re using are not proven yet. The business models have still to come – so these are very early stage. And so I know you’re being humorous, but the universities are driving the talent.\n\nWhen we do our diligence, we think about whether what they’re producing is worth the investment. And we now have really good people at the company focused on this, so our ability to sniff out in diligence a promising idea or approach versus companies that aren’t bringing a lot of value to the table is pretty good. But because we do investment after investment in this space and have assembled a pretty good team, these founders are excited to come work with us.\n\nThere’s a lot of talk about how the Alphabet restructuring and the hiring of CFO Ruth Porat brought a “new austerity” to the company. In that environment, a deal like YouTube or a hypothetical WhatsApp seems unlikely. Does it mean you’re being more disciplined with deals?\n\nLooking at Sundar’s strategy on the Google side of things, I’ve only seen it grow in the areas we’re focused on and thinking about addressing. Looking at the strategy of the company, I think we’ve succeeded over the last year since we transitioned to Alphabet to be more disciplined about the bets we’re supporting. But our willingness to buy a DoubleClick, or a DeepMind, etc., I’ve only seen excitement about bringing those kinds of opportunities forward. We’ll be just as aggressive as we were in 2006 when we decided to buy YouTube.\n\nThere’s a lot of coop-etition going on lately. Alphabet now competes with its investment Uber, Uber merged with Didi, Didi has investment from SoftBank, SoftBank has Apple as one of its limited partners. It seems confusing, awkward, and full of potential conflicts of interest. How are you navigating that?\n\nCompetition between tech companies is still very much alive. I don’t think we could look at us and Amazon, Apple and Facebook and say there is a lessoning of competition. We seem to be competing as vigorously as we’ve always competed.\n\nThat being said, there is more opportunity – Uber is in transportation, telecoms like Verizon and AT&T are doing things that are getting them closer and closer to technology. You’re seeing a lot of these barriers starting to erode and break down and it’s a chance for competition and a chance for partnership. As technology disrupts, it breaks down these categories and that puts companies in competitive mode and opens the possibility for partnership.\n\nIt’s probably always been this complicated, but more lately we’ve seen technology companies wrestle with this competition. But it’s always been there. I think the introduction of some of the Chinese companies has increased the complications and made partnership both a possibility and something we need to think about.\n\nWith so much competition, do you consider doing deals to keep assets out of a competitor’s hands?\n\nThe rationales come up from time to time but my experience is that they don’t support deals. Generally speaking they provide something to think about, but if there isn’t a product thesis or fit, or we’re not excited about the founder coming to join Google, generally speaking, those aren’t deals that we pursue.\n\nWhat did you learn from Nest and Dropcam deals?\n\nI did both of those deals. I’m excited about the thesis behind them. All deals, all companies, all projects go through ebbs and flows in terms of success and failure, but the general thesis of a smart home is one I believe in strongly. I’m still excited and you see that kind of evolution with Google Home, Alexa and all of the current investments in a variety of smart home categories. I don’t know what lessons you mean, but I might not have learned the right ones.\n\nI mean that there has been negative press about the companies after they were bought. Would you structure those deals differently now?\n\nM&A will never be 100% successful and we learn from every deal we do, and so not to pick on any specific deal, but I’ve learned, based on relative success of deals we’ve done in the past, is making sure the key leaders at the company share a vision with the founder, making sure the strategy drives the M&A, as opposed to the M&A driving the strategy, and making sure we have good support mechanisms for these companies after they come in.\n\nX is shutting down failed projects. Will we see divestitures?\n\nI think Niantic [creator of the popular Pokemon Go game] is our most famous divestiture. [Laughs.]\n\nWe have done divestitures and I’m a fan of us thinking about that actively. Google is still very much in growth mode. When I look at Sundar’s and Alphabet’s strategy, I see broadening the vision. We should continue to make good bets across a variety of areas and recognize that some of those aren’t going to succeed and divestiture becomes a good home.\n\nSketchUp [a 3D modeling business] is an example from [2012]. Niantic is a current example. I’d like to be open to this in the future. Discipline is important and divesting is a tool for that.\n\nMany are expecting corporate tax holiday to drive M&A this year. Agree or disagree?\n\nThere’s been enough commentary on tax reform that we’ll be thinking about that this year." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1636897259574251, 0.1226668250448738 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4770542019435824, 0.5039784605638264 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-01-30T19:13:23.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-30T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

It’s always been known that devices running Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android operating system are much more susceptible to being infected than Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhones. However, the situation may be even worse than we realized.\n\nSource: Check Point Software Technologies\n\nA mobile security research team posted on Friday that it scanned devices owned by two large companies and found Android malware pre-installed on smartphones from 38 different manufacturers.\n\nThat discovery should concern both corporate IT departments, and consumers. And it once again validates Apple’s “controlling” iPhone approach.\n\nAndroid Malware Illustrates the Downside of Google’s Approach\n\nFrom the launch of the first iPhone in 2007, Apple retained full control of its iOS operating system and installed it only on its own hardware. Apps can only be downloaded from the App Store and these are checked and vetted by Apple engineers.\n\nWith limited hardware configurations, Apple is able to test iOS thoroughly for all iPhone users. The company is aggressive about pushing out new iOS versions (79% of all iPhones are running iOS 10), and in the event of a security issue, it’s able to quickly push out system updates to address it.\n\nWith Android, GOOGL took a very different approach from Apple. It went wide open, licensing Android to dozens of different smartphone manufacturers. Users are free to tinker with the operating system and they can download apps from virtually anywhere — not just Google Play. This open approach helped Google to dominate the smartphone industry, with nine out of 10 new smartphones running Android.\n\nBut the approach makes smartphone security a nightmare.\n\nAndroid updates often require manufacturer and/or carrier cooperation. As a result, only 2% of Android devices are running the latest version of Android, while the majority are running software that’s at least several years out of date.\n\nFreedom to install questionable apps plus an older version of the operating system has let Android malware run rampant. At one point it was estimated to account for 97% of all mobile malware.\n\nCheck Point’s Pre-Installed Android Malware Discovery\n\nCheck Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: CHKP ), an IT security company, reported in a Friday blog post that it had scanned the smartphones for two large companies (identified only as “large telecommunications company” and a “multinational technology company”) and discovered Android malware had been pre-installed on smartphones from 38 different hardware manufacturers.\n\nAndroid malware identified ranged from adware to mobile ransomware capable of encrypting all data on the device until a fee is paid to unlock it. Some had been added to the smartphone ROM, meaning reinstalling Android would not remove it. And none of this malware was downloaded by users. The smartphones arrived at the two companies pre-infected, with installation happening “somewhere along the supply chain.”\n\nNext Page" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1130634071810542 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.5554214413037941 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-13T13:04:07.000+0000" } ] }

With this, digital advertising has suddenly witnessed a major boom with two of the largest tech companies capturing a lion share of the market. Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are claiming the throne in the digital ad market, Cantor Fitzgerald contends in a research report released today.\n\nThe firm’s observation of growth trends for the two tech giants reveals that they have been driving \"a disproportionate share\" of the revenue growth being garnered into the digital advertising industry. The firm goes on to say that next year, Google and Facebook will together account for “virtually 100% of all incremental dollars” generated in the industry.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald talks about the great deal of creativity and innovation that is coming from these two tech players. This trend further suggests that digital advertisers aren’t going to spend their dollars on all other competing platforms either. Rather, they’d prefer getting their ads published in the best medium possible i.e. Facebook and Google. The firm, therefore, expects to spend on all other competing platforms likely to remain flat for next year and may see a decline beginning 2018.\n\n“We remain constructive on Goolge and Facebook given their massive, yet expanding audiences/reach, their data and highly engaging mobile and video ad formats, all at a compelling valuation, in our view,” writes Cantor Fitzgerald in its research report.\n\nFurthermore, the firm believes that Google and Facebook would command nearly two-third of all global digital ad spend for the current year and the next. Google would command 46.5% and 47.5% of total global digital ad revenue in 2016 and 2017. While Facebook is growing faster considerably, it falls as a decisive second at 15.7% and 19.2% share for 2016 and 2017, respectively. However, together, these companies represent and control almost 2/3 of all global spending on digital ads currently. The firm writes that this trend may become problematic for traditional advertisers and ad agencies if it continues to sustain longer term.\n\nOne of the striking reasons for these two companies to have grown much faster than the entire sector on average is their scale and size. Both these bigger peers have become faster helped by a positive and greater network effect on usage and daily average users. High momentum around their product innovations has also contributed to reaching out to much wider audiences, thus inducing spending by digital ad industry." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.05612778730703261 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3704802744425385 ], "publish_date" : [ null ] }

We have every reason to believe it will continue,” said Schmidt, a software engineer who is the executive chairman of Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google.\n\nSchmidt expressed confidence that the unsalaried work of the board would continue while acknowledging that he has received no assurances as yet from the Trump transition team or from retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, Trump’s choice for defense secretary.\n\nThe forecast for the continuation of the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, or DIUx, another creation of outgoing Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, is less certain. DIUx was set up last year with the goal of speeding the process of getting new technology from “non-traditional sources” into the hands of warfighters\n\nThe National Defense Authorization Act passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama limited funding for DIUx, and Pentagon officials said its future would be in question in the new administration.\n\nHowever, DIUx has a defender in retired Adm. William McRaven, the former head of U.S Special Operations Command and a member of the Defense Innovation Board. At the board’s meeting Monday, McRaven, who organized the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, said that keeping DIUx “seems like a no-brainer.” He called the creation of DIUx “one of the great decisions of Secretary Carter.”\n\nWhile stating that the Defense Innovation Board would likely continue into the next administration, Schmidt was less sure that all of the current board members would agree to stay.\n\n“I have indicated I would be very happy to serve under [the Trump administration], and I believe all, or everyone but maybe one, will continue” on the board, said Schmidt, who was a major contributor to Obama’s election campaigns.\n\n“I’m just assuming one or two might choose [to leave], but I don’t know. My current expectation is everyone would stay on. No one has told me they are leaving, but it’s also the case no one has been asked by the new administration to stay because the new administration doesn’t exist yet,” Schmidt said.\n\nBoard members Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist and director of New York City’s Hayden Planetarium, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman have been critical of Trump.\n\nBoth Hoffman and Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder who was criticized by Trump during the campaign, were not at the board meeting Monday. Tyson was present and indicated that he would stay.\n\n“All the carefully selected quotes that you find in these halls [of the Pentagon], they pledge allegiance to the Constitution,” Tyson said. “And I have yet to see a quote that talks about the president. So I think there is a higher mission statement that we all live by here.”\n\nCarter set up the Defense Innovation Board last April, and the board met for the first time to consider recommendations in October. Carter then approved three recommendations to create the post of chief innovation officer at DoD, boost the number of “cyber recruits” in the military and set up a DoD center on artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nAt the meeting Monday, the board considered and approved several other recommendations.

Its investment will start over the next several days and be completed in the second half of the year, Temasek added.\n\n...", "Alphabet’s health-focused subsidiary Verily, formerly Google Life Sciences before the great corporate alphabetization, has received an $800 million investment from Temasek, the majority of which is to be delivered mostly over the next few days, with a smaller portion of funding coming in the second half of 2017.\n\nTemasek is an investment company based in Singapore, with investments across a wide range of industries and global offices around the world. The investment firm is described in a press release as focusing on companies tackling long-term trends, and Verily definitely fits the bill with its efforts to address issues like deteriorating vision and Parkinson’s disease.\n\nVerily is also doing work on disease detection, including via efforts to bring to life a real-world Tricorder, mimicking the fictional performance of the device with the same name depicted in the Star Trek franchise. Stat News reported last year that Verily’s efforts on this front weren’t turning out quite as hoped, however.\n\nStill, Verily’s portfolio also includes a project to establish a healthy baseline for human beings, down to the genetic level, as well as develop a health tracking wristband designed for actually monitoring patients as a prescription device, and efforts to help develop ever more advanced surgical assistance robots. It’s also looking to build better bugs (actual insects) in an effort to combat disease transmission.\n\nThe investment will result in Temasek getting a minority stake in Verily, and Temasek will also get to nominate one of its own as a board member for the Alphabet-owned company. Verily CEO Andrew Conrad also noted in the press release announcing the investment that Temasek will help the company strategically as it looks to build out its business in Asia and beyond the U.S.\n\nVerily is moving towards more commercialization of its work through this new investment, and it’s not the only Alphabet subsidiary to begin to pursue commercial applications of its work with more apparent urgency. Waymo, which previously existed as Google’s Self-Driving Car project, also recently took a number of steps towards making its primarily research-focused organization more of a potential revenue center.", "Alphabet Inc.’s medical arm Verily Life Sciences LLC is getting a major influx of cash from a Singapore-based investment company, boosting the odds of taking their futuristic approach to healthcare into Asian markets.\n\nTemasek Holdings Pte Ltd, a state-owned firm, is investing $800 million in Verily, according to a statement from the company Thursday. In exchange, Temasek will get a minority stake in Verily and a seat on its operating board.\n\n“With a substantial network and insights into the economies in Asia, Temasek will provide valuable guidance as we look to ex-U.S. markets with our development partners,” Verily Chief Executive Officer Andrew Conrad, said in the statement.\n\nTemasek’s investment supports the move by Alphabet CEO Larry Page to run each of his subsidiaries as independent companies. The units, which work in disparate industries, vary in their autonomy from Google’s infrastructure and corporate support. To date, Verily has been funded by Google’s massive advertising revenue.\n\nThe agreement could also signal Verily’s plans to expand into China. About 23 percent of Temasek’s portfolio is in China, the largest by underlying asset exposure after Singapore, according to the company. Google pulled most of its services from China in 2010, citing political reasons. But Alphabet has not said whether this ban applies to the other companies under its umbrella.\n\nVerily aims to develop software and hardware for the healthcare field. The group debuted Google’s experimental research lab with a smart contact lens that measures glucose. It has since expanded to a myriad of medical projects, ranging from specialized spoons for Parkinson’s disease patients and recently to a sterile mosquito breeding effort to combat the Zika virus.\n\nThe company primarily makes money through licensing. It has cut deals with several traditional pharmaceutical companies such as Novartis AG, which is developing the contact lens, and Biogen Inc. Verily has also funded a robotic surgery company with Johnson & Johnson and started a bio-electronics joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline Plc.\n\nVerily resides in the tech giant’s so-called Other Bets bucket, the corporate units apart from Google. Verily is one of three in the group that brings in revenue, the company has said. Smart-home device maker Nest and high-speed internet service Google Fiber are the other two. Altogether, the Other Bets unit generated $197 million in revenue during the third quarter.\n\nIn 2015, Alphabet put $869 million in capital spending into the Other Bet companies.\n\nTemasek has a net portfolio value of $180 billion and recently said it has increased its focus on North American technology ventures.

Value investment tends to focus more on the long-term fundamental and actual worth of companies instead of volatility based on market overreactions amid good or bad news around stocks. In its third-quarter letter to the investors, Trapeze Asset Management called the post-election rally in the markets as the “most bizarre” occurrence in the finance world. The fund thinks that the prime mover of this unprecedented rally is rising interest rates. Rate hikes are helping banks and financial institutions according to the hedge fund, but they are not “necessarily” good for the overall economy. Trapeze expects more rate hikes from the Federal Reserve in the near future.\n\nTrapeze Asset Management’s strategy involves buying positions in small and large cap companies and selling them when they rise close to their respective Fair Market Value (FMV). Let’s take look at some of the important stocks which were sold by the fund in the third quarter as they reached their FMVs.\n\nWe follow over 700 hedge funds and other institutional investors and by analyzing their quarterly 13F filings, we identify stocks that they are collectively bullish on and develop investment strategies based on this data.

Meanwhile, Alphabet’s stock closed at $830.94 an increase of $1.41 or 0.17%.", "Published By: Ken Bock on January 17, 2017 09:55 am EST\n\nSoon you will be able to make payments through Google Assistant with your Pixel and Nexus phones. This hint was provided by a beta version of the Google App; users might be able to pay for items they purchase via voice commands.\n\nThe beta update of the application might have payment options, similar to Amazon’s Alexa. It may allow users to perform various tasks, such as ordering an Uber or purchasing clothing items. Additions to the services will also include an expansion of third-party APIs. Many things that have been seen in the APK file suggest that these rumors of mobile payments via the assistant might actually be true.\n\nIt is not yet known what exactly will the assistant be used to specifically pay for, but it is possible to be very similar to Amazon’s Alexa. Uber is already available on Google Home; users might be able to shop on Google Express Shopping. Users may be required to provide an address for the delivery, which might be taken care of by Google API.\n\nThese reports have been made by XDA developers who believe that these features are about to come very soon. Google Assistant has managed to become more productive and handy in the last few months, and may soon begin to give tough competition to Amazon’s Alexa. This new shopping feature will also be ideal for users who enjoy shopping online, and should go well with Google Home, which was previously known as Google Cast.\n\nIf Google Assistant enables users to shop, it will surely have more to offer than Alexa, which is mostly focused on online shopping. However, customers interested in this feature are advised not to hold their breath, since there has been no official word over these speculations or when this update will come out officially. It has been seen in the latest APK, but it has not come to Google Play Store as of yet." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.2105306762203314, 0.2678077066965956 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4927951933124347, 0.5446333707444819 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-01-17T00:00:00.000+0000" }, null ] }

(GOOG), and Tyson Foods ..." ], "article_text" : [ "Shares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are on a recovery track as they have regained 23.55% since bottoming out at $663.28 on Jun. 27, 2016. Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost -3.41% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 6.18% so far on the year — still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -3.98% from $853.5 , the 52-week high touched on Mar. 21, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 11.72% for the past 12 months.\n\nBrokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to buy Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)’s shares projecting a $970.75 target price. What do this target means? Price targets reflect what the analyst believes a stock will be worth four quarters into the future. Are investors supposed to sell when the stock hits the target? Price targets frequently change, depending on the outlook for a company’s earnings. Sometimes it may seem like it, but analysts don’t just pull their price targets out of thin air. Typically, they estimate what the company’s earnings and cash flow will be for the next couple of years, and then apply a ratio – such as a price-to-earnings ratio – to those estimates to determine what the future stock price should theoretically be.\n\nGOOG’s revenue has declined at an average annualized rate of about 0% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 22.2% looks attractive.\n\nWhile there are a number of profitability ratios that measure a company’s ability to generate profit from the sales or services it provides, one of the most important is the net profit margin. It tells us what percentage of revenue a company keeps after all its bills are paid. While the higher this number is, the better, there is no gold standard. That’s why this number shouldn’t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company’s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, Alphabet Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at 21.58%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 16.64%, and the sector’s average is 4.7%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector.\n\nTyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -19.14% since hitting a peak level of $77.05 on Sep. 06, 2016. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -0.98% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 0.62% so far on the year — still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 11.81% higher from $55.72, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Nov. 21, 2016, but are collecting gains at -18.3% for the past six months.\n\nThe good news is there’s still room for the share price to grow. At recent closing price of $61.84, TSN has a chance to add $7.16 or 11.58% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($69) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.4 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 0.16 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride.\n\nFor the past 5 years, Tyson Foods, Inc.’s EPS growth has been nearly 17.9%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 2.27%, annually.\n\nTwo other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company’s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company’s ability to turn an investor’s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders’ behalf. Tyson Foods, Inc.’s ROE is 19.68%, while industry’s is 16.77%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 73.24%.\n\nReturn on assets, on the other hand, measures a company’s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets. TSN’s ROA is 8.36%, while industry’s average is 8.39%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 28.47." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.05251763668430335 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4343430335097002 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-28T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nThe “applied research scientist position” described in a job posting on DeepMind’s website Thursday will be located at Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. It would be the first of “a couple dozen” the company hires, a spokesman said, as DeepMind builds \"a small team\" in the U.S. \"to bridge the gap between Google and our team in London, helping us collaborate even more closely to bring our research breakthroughs to Google users around the world.\"\n\nDeepMind has not previously had any researchers based outside of London.\n\n“The Applied team in Mountain View will be made up of a mixture of software engineers and research scientists who work together to solve real-world problems at Google-scale,” according to the job listing.\n\nThe new hires will have their own offices at Google’s headquarters. Google’s other artificial intelligence research division, Google Brain, which uses machine learning to improve several Google products, also has offices on that campus. Both vie for the highly competitive field of artificial intelligence experts.\n\nDeepMind is divided into two divisions, one of which does pure computer science research and another, called its applied division, which tries to build real-world products and services based on artificial intelligence. About three-quarters of DeepMind’s staff of 350 work for the research division, while the rest work for the applied unit.\n\nThe applied division has partnered with the U.K.’s National Health Service on two pilot projects, including one that uses AI to read eye scans. But its primary customer has been Google itself.\n\nThe division used machine learning to figure out how to improve the efficiency of Google’s data centers around the world, resulting in a 40 percent reduction in the amount of energy needed to cool the facilities and a 15 percent improvement in overall power usage efficiency, which measures the power consumed by the data centers’ computers compared with the total energy the facility uses.\n\nDeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, who heads the company’s applied division, has talked about using similar techniques to try to bring efficiency gains to national electricity grids.\n\nThe company has said its AI technology has also been incorporated into unspecified improvements in how Google displays advertising and in the shopping experience in the Google Play store, which sells apps for Google’s Android operating system.\n\nIn the future, Google may seek to incorporate DeepMind’s recent breakthrough in computer-generated speech, using a technique in which the AI system correctly predicts how to form the next part of a sound wave, to Google products such as its personal digital assistant.\n\nThe newly advertised job’s responsibilities include making reinforcement learning --- which uses rewards, such as points in a game, to teach an AI program how to perform a task -- more relevant to solving real-world problems.\n\nDeepMind is perhaps best known for AlphaGo, an AI agent that earlier this year beat one of the world’s reigning champions in the ancient strategy game Go. The victory was considered a major milestone in computer science because Go has too many possible move combinations for a computer to use raw computational power to win. Instead, it must rely on something more akin to human intuition to develop winning strategies." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.08574154179154179 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4555459207459207 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-15T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

( Source: DeepMind) Elastic Weight Consolidation or EWC computes how important each connection in a neural network is to the task it has just learned and then assigns this connection a mathematical weight proportional to its importance. ( Source: DeepMind)\n\nDeepMind, the London-based artificial intelligence company owned by Alphabet Inc., claims it overcame a key limitation affecting one of the most promising machine learning technologies: the software’s inability to remember.\n\nThe breakthrough, described in a paper published Tuesday in the academic journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, may open the way for artificial intelligence systems to be more easily applied to multiple tasks, instead of being narrowly trained for one purpose. It should also improve the ability of AI systems to transfer knowledge between tasks and to master a sequence of linked steps.\n\nWatch all our videos from Express Technology\n\nNeural networks, software which is loosely based on the structure of synapses in the human brain, are considered the best machine learning technique for language translation, image classification and image generation. But these networks suffer from a major flaw scientists call “catastrophic forgetting.” They exist in a kind of perpetual present: every time the network is given new data, it overwrites what it has previously learned.\n\nIn human brains, neuroscientists believe that one way in which memory works is that connections between neurons that seem important for a particular skill become less likely to be rewired. The DeepMind researchers drew on this theory, known as synaptic consolidation, to create a way to allow neural networks to remember. They worked with Claudia Clopath, a neuroscientist at London’s Imperial College, who is a co-author on the paper. “We have shown it is possible to train a neural network sequentially, which was previously thought to be a fundamental limitation,” James Kirkpatrick, a DeepMind researcher who was the lead author on the paper, said in an interview.\n\nThe researchers created an algorithm, called Elastic Weight Consolidation or EWC that computes how important each connection in a neural network is to the task it has just learned and then assigns this connection a mathematical weight proportional to its importance. The weight slows down the rate at which the value of that particular node in the neural network can be altered. In this way, the network is able to retain knowledge while learning a new task.\n\nThe researchers tested the algorithm on ten classic Atari games, which the neural network had to learn to play from scratch. DeepMind had previously created an AI agent able to play these games as well or better than any human player. But that earlier AI could only learn one game at a time. If it was later shown one of the first games it learned, it had to start all over again. The new EWC-enabled software was able to learn all ten games and, on average, come close to human-level performance on all of them. It did not, however, perform as well as a neural network trained specifically for just one game, the researchers wrote.\n\nAlso Read: Alphabet’s DeepMind is exploring why robots could end up killing\n\nPeter Dayan, a professor of neuroscience at University College London, said DeepMind’s paper might benefit neuroscientists in thinking about how synaptic consolidation works. He said studies by psychologist John Pearce, at Cardiff University, seemed to indicate a very similar mechanism determined which synapses were available or unavailable for new learning.\n\nDeepMind, which Alphabet purchased for 400 million pounds ($486.4 million) in 2014, is best known for having created AI software able to beat the world’s best players at the ancient Asian strategy game Go. That achievement was considered a major milestone in computer science because Go has so many possible moves that a computer cannot simply figure out the best move in every situation and instead must rely on something more akin to intuition – making educated guesses based on its own experience.\n\nFor all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1559506261712144 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4561781029428087 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-15T12:31:00.000+0000" } ] }

(NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stocks worth adding to your portfolio? In short the answer is likely yes, since each of these companies is among the leaders in its respective industry. However, each stock is rather expensive and it is not guaranteed that all of them will outperform the market, at least in the short term. There are many ways to analyze a stock, one of which is to see how smart investors are trading it, which is what we do at Insider Monkey. The smartest investors in recent quarters seem to be, well, robots or quant hedge funds.\n\nWe track over 700 hedge funds and other institutional investors and analyze every quarter the general sentiment among them towards thousands of stock. One particularly interesting group of investors that we follow are quantitative hedge funds, many of which are some of the largest and best-performing funds on Wall Street. We calculated the returns of some of these funds using data from their publicly available 13F filings, and determined that most quant funds managed to outperform the market even though in some instances their picks were less risky than the broader market. For example, the top five stock picks of Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies posted an equal-weighted average gain of 1.17% per month between 2008 and 2012, outperforming the S&P 500 which inched up by 0.29% per month during the same period. When we adjusted returns for known factor returns like size, value, and momentum RenTech’s alpha turned out to be 103 basis points per month. This means this quant hedge fund’s top picks were able to beat the market by almost a percentage point a month by investing in a portfolio of less risky stocks.\n\nHaving said that, we have lined up six quantitative hedge funds: Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management, David E. Shaw’s D. E. Shaw & Co., Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies, Peter Muller’s PDT Partners, and Neil Chriss’ Hutchin Hill Capital. In a previous article, we have discussed most of these funds, as well as their top stock picks. In this piece, we’ll take a look how these funds traded the aforementioned four stocks: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Most of the quant funds in question own shares of each of these stocks, but based on the size of each position and the changes it underwent during the third quarter, we will try to determine two stocks that could potentially represent the best investments.\n\nLet’s start with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), in which all five of the six quants held shares heading into the fourth quarter, while one fund closed its position between July and September. The largest positions are held by D. E. Shaw & Co. and AQR Capital Management, which disclosed ownership of 6.68 million shares and 6.44 million shares, respectively. Moreover, both funds held Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as their second-largest holding and both increased their exposure to the stock over the quarter, but, while AQR Capital increased it by just 14%, D. E. Shaw boosted it by 178%. Other quants that increased their stakes included PDT Partners, which added 17,200 shares to its stake, taking it to 89,500 shares, while Hutchin Hill Capital added 24,900 shares and held 25,000 shares at the end of September. However, at the same time, we have two funds that limited their exposure to the stock. As stated earlier, one investor that sold all of its shares in Apple is Renaissance Technologies, which had previously owned nearly 1.10 million shares (at the end of June). In addition, Two Sigma Advisors cut its stake by 81% and held just 48,531 shares heading into the fourth quarter. So, from what it looks like the quants that we are discussing in this article are overall bullish on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is also supported by our more general data across all hedge funds tracked by us, with the number of investors long Apple jumping to 145 from 116 during the third quarter." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1265873015873016 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3464037698412698 ], "publish_date" : [ null ] }

First, we got a look at how the device would look like, thanks to some leaks. Now, more of details have surfaced about the feature set it will offer. Today, CNET reported that the LG G6 would come with Google Assistant built-in.\n\nThis notion would make the G6 the first phone, apart from the Pixel phones to offer the digital assistant. Users will get access to the chatbot, along with the complete voice command functionality. It seems that this year the focus on personal assistants will be great. These assistants are now considered a big selling point for the devices. Even Samsung is rumored to enter this competition with Bixby - its virtual assistant. The company recently acquired the AI startup Viv Labs to ensure a stellar product.\n\nAccording to CNET, LG was first opting to use Amazon Alexa with the LG G6; however, it decided against it since it felt that the assistant wasn't up to the task. Along with these new features, we already know a few details about the upcoming device. It is reported that the phone would feature a 5.7-inch display with an 18:9 aspect ratio, sports premium metal construction and will be waterproof.

According to reports, Google will focus on two departments for Pixel 2 more than others: camera and CPU.\n\nPixel and Pixel XL sported rear camera lenses that were critically-acclaimed, and even rated by DxOMark as the best smartphone camera to date. You’d then think that not a lot could be change or improved in a camera that was rated as the best ever only a few months ago, but Google certainly seems ready to be seen as the company that likes to sit on its laurels, now that it has launched its premium Android smartphone.\n\nMoreover, a new SoC is also being discussed for Pixel 2, reportedly from two different vendors similar to what Samsung does with the Qualcomm Snapdragon and its own Exynos offerings. However, these improvements might not come without a price, literally; a price bump is also reported for Pixel 2, which could be a slippery slope for Google.\n\nBut even that price bump might be accompanied by a different option for users; a low-end Pixel could also be launched that would help users go for lesser specs for a much-lesser price, if the premium Pixel 2 offering is too tight a squeeze in their budget. Bear in mind though, that all of this is mere speculation and hear-say, and before we get more news from supply chain sources or closer to Google itself, Pixel 2 and its changes are mere dust in the wind.", "In this Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016, file photo, the new Google Pixel phone is displayed following a product event, in San Francisco. Google's head-on rival to the iPhone, the Pixel, is off to a modest but promising start. It is Google's first step in what it says will be a years-long effort to take on Apple where it's strongest. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) The Pixel phone, Google's answer to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy, is off to a promising start—but might have done even better had Google managed consumer demand as smartly as the device's sleek design.\n\nAlthough Google hasn't released sales figures, industry researchers say the Pixel has been a hot item since its October debut was greeted with mostly glowing reviews and the biggest marketing blitz in Google's 18-year history.\n\nBut there were missed opportunities.\n\nGoogle didn't have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people aren't likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two.\n\nGoogle also struck a deal to sell it through just one wireless carrier, Verizon. Although Google's online store sold Pixels compatible with other wireless networks, most people don't shop for phones that way. Of course, it's a moot point if there weren't enough Pixels to sell, but Google likely would have produced more if it had distribution deals with other carriers.\n\nIt's not surprising that Google misjudged the market, given that this is the search company's first stab at making its own phone. Previously, it partnered with various manufacturers on a Nexus line of phones to showcase its Android operating system, but that effort barely made a dent.\n\n\"This was probably a really good learning experience for them,\" says Neil Doshi, an analyst with Mizhuo Securities USA.\n\nThe Pixel's success is important to Google because it wants to ensure there's a stylish Android phone to compete with the iPhone and drive more affluent consumers to its search engine, maps, YouTube videos and other services. Samsung's Galaxy and other phones also run on Android, but those devices have been de-emphasizing Google's services.\n\nIn this Monday, Feb. 1, 2016, file photo, electronic screens post prices of Alphabet stock at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York. Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, reports earnings Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)\n\nGoogle, which is based in Mountain View, California, can afford to make some mistakes as it tries to establish the Pixel because its internet search and advertising network brings in so much revenue.\n\nAlphabet, Google's corporate parent, provided another reminder of its financial might with Thursday's release of its fourth-quarter earnings. The company earned $5.3 billion on revenue of $26 billion during the final three months of last year. Even after subtracting commissions paid to Google's ad partners, Alphabet's revenue totaled $21 billion—a 23 percent increase from a year earlier. The company's profit rose 8 percent from the prior year.\n\nAlthough Pixel sales weren't disclosed, the numbers provided a clue on how the phone did. Google's \"other revenue\" segment, which covers all sales outside of advertising, generated $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, a 62 percent increase from the same time last year.\n\nSome of those gains came from sales of Google's new internet-connected speaker, Home, and its business software services, but Doshi believes most of the increase was generated by the Pixel.\n\nHe estimates Google sold 1 million to 1.5 million Pixels during the fourth quarter. That's still just a sliver of the estimated 77 million that Apple sold during the same period (Apple is scheduled to release its numbers Tuesday). Pixel sales are also well below the roughly 15 million Galaxy S7 that Samsung sold during that device's first quarter on the market.\n\nStill, analysts say the Pixel did exceptionally well for a new phone with little brand recognition.\n\n\"Without question, Google has a hit on its hands and is building a platform for success,\" says Jeff Moore, principal of Wave7 Research. Wave7 estimates that Pixel accounted for 12 percent of activations in December compared with 51 percent for iPhones and 26 percent for Samsung devices.\n\nLocalytics, which tracks app activity on nearly 2 billion smartphones, also reported Pixel activations have steadily increased since sales began, especially around the Thanksgiving weekend and the holidays.\n\n\"It looks like it has the potential to be a strong competitor to the likes of Apple and Samsung,\" says Josh Todd, Localytics' chief marketing officer.\n\nExplore further: Alphabet profit up as 'big bets' show promise (Update)" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1572192513368984, 0.154004329004329, 0.155757105213627 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.2917112299465239, 0.4784271284271284, 0.4510053955706129 ], "publish_date" : [ null, null, null ] }

(AMD) and ..." ], "article_text" : [ "With Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) introducing its new Zen-based Ryzen desktop into the market and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) announcing YouTube will now be offering a TV subscription to its user base, analysts from Rosenblatt and Baird are riding the bullish train on these two tech giants. One analyst believes Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) should be quaking, as AMD prepares to take the market by storm. Meanwhile, one of the top analysts on the Street is confident on Alphabet’s standing, predicting long-term growth lies ahead. Let’s dive in:\n\nAMD Offers Better Performing Desktop Than INTC at a Fraction of the Cost\n\nRosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann sees this week as an enticing time to chime in on AMD with the chip giant primed to accelerate desktop gains and re-capture the market from competitor Intel, thanks to AMD’s new Ryzen release. March is about to treat the chip giant well.\n\nIn reaction, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of AMD with a $16.50 price target, which represents a 13% increase from where the stock is currently trading.\n\nMosesmann sees AMD’s zen launch as one that is enough to rattle INTC investors, as he explains, “Zen-based Ryzen 7 desktop x86 CPU (available now) has disrupted the desktop PC gaming segment with the value proposition of half the price (of a ~$1K high end 8-core i7 series from Intel […] at better performance (~5%). Fair enough. AMD should gain share in desktops. The angle here is that gamers are likely to use that $500 savings to spend on a better display, or GPU card, or storage solution. An incremental tail wind for GPU spend. BUT the real take-way: The 8-core Ryzen 7 is a 95 watt rated CPU, over 30% more thrifty on energy than Intel’s 8-core i7 6900K. This is an eyebrow-raising event to say the least and likely due to a very efficient design not easily solved by Intel in the near-term (process or architecture-wise).”\n\n“We are in the camp of AMD re-capturing 10% or more of the x86 market in dollars (PC and server) as they did 7-8 years ago,” Mosesmann surmises.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, which measures analysts’ and bloggers’ success rate based on how their calls perform, five-star analyst Hans Mosesmann is ranked #357 out of 4,503 analysts. Mosesmann has a 54% success rate and realizes 12.3% in his annual returns. However, when suggesting AMD, Mosesmann loses 24.4% in average profits on the stock.\n\nTipRanks analytics demonstrate AMD as a Buy. Out of 22 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 10 are bullish on AMD stock, 10 remain sidelined, and 2 are bearish on the stock. With a loss potential of 25%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $10.92.\n\nAlphabet Raring to Take on Amazon/Prime and Netflix with New YouTube TV\n\nAlphabet revealed yesterday YouTube is ready to make a serious play into the over-the-top (OTT) content world by entering a highly-anticipated TV subscription offering into the mix. From the eyes of Baird top analyst Colin Sebastian, this move affirms Alphabet is “[…] taking OTT more seriously,” and he commends the undertaking as strategic.\n\nTherefore, as YouTube TV takes careful “aim at offline ad budgets,” the analyst reiterates an Outperform rating on GOOGL with a price target of $960, which represents a 12% increase from where the shares last closed.\n\nSebastian opines, “YouTube TV announcement suggests Google taking OTT more seriously. While long-rumored, yesterday’s announcement of YouTube TV subscription serve more formally established Google/YouTube as a player in the over-the-top (OTT) content and distribution market, and set to compete more directly with legacy cable/satellite networks as well as pure-play online subscription alternatives (e.g. Amazon/Prime Instant Video, Netflix.) We believe Google/YouTube is well positioned in the market with a large 1 billion+ active user base, significant streaming/download capabilities, and resources to license and create content.”\n\nIn fact, the analyst projects this step will not only generate further subscription revenue growth, but the news could also […] accelerate the migration of linear TV ad budgets online.”\n\nOverall, “Investments in original content likely to continue. We believe accelerated investment in owned/licensed and live content (YouTube mobile live streaming rolled out to channels with >10,000 subscribers) will be an important long-term driver of YouTube growth,” concludes Sebastian.\n\nColin Sebastian has a very good TipRanks score with a high ranking of #17 out of 4,503 analysts and a 78% success rate. Sebastian earns 18.9% in his yearly returns. When recommending GOOGL, Sebastian garners 17.0% in average profits on the stock.\n\nTipRanks analytics exhibit GOOGL as a Strong Buy. Based on 28 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 26 rate a Buy on Alphabet stock, 1 maintains a Hold, while 1 issues a Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $1,002.00, marking a 17% upside from where the stock is currently trading.\n\nMore stocks covered by top performing analysts can be found here." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.116456358956359 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.5389937989937991 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-02T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

Traditional new ratings such as “Buy” and “Outperform” ratings in established Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks and S&P 500 stocks come with upside targets implying gains of 8% to 15% at this stage in the bull market.\n\nWith a new analyst coverage from Barclays’ Ross Sandler, Amazon and Alphabet are given far stronger upside targets. Facebook’s call looks more traditional in the upside. Notes have been provided on each call, as has the market reaction and the views of analysts from Thomson Reuters.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) was started with an Overweight rating and was assigned a whopping $1,120 price target. That implies upside of close to 30%, and it blows away the consensus analyst target price of $941.38 despite being well under the street-high analyst target of $1,250.\n\nBarclays called Amazon out as being — “arguably the best story in the space, with the most open-ended growth opportunity.” They also called Amazon the most highly functional organization with the largest total addressable markets that will be among the first $1 trillion market cap companies in the years ahead.\n\nAmazon shares were up the most of the three stocks on Wednesday, up $18.96 (2.2%) at $874.96. Its 52-week range is now $585.25 to $876.36, with that 52-week high being from the same day.\n\nALSO READ: 7 Analyst Stocks With 50% to 100% (or even more) Upside\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was started with an Overweight rating at Barclays and the firm assigned a $1,065 price target. This target represents almost 27% upside in the parent of Google, and the Thomson Reuters consensus analyst target is $986.92. This call is almost as strong as the street high analyst target of $1,100 in the Thomson Reuters universe.\n\nBarclays noted that Alphabet’s pace of innovation is high. That is particularly in the case of it updating many core applications in conjunction with its own advanced machine learning, or artificial intelligence. They also noted that Google is expanding its reach in the cloud and in hardware.\n\nAlphabet’s shares were up $9.82 (1.17%) at $850.45 late on Wednesday, versus its 52-week range of $672.66 to $874.42.\n\nFacebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) was also started with an overweight rating at Barclays. The firm’s $154 price target implied upside of less than 9% and their price target is actually under the Thomson Reuters consensus target of $160.32.\n\nWhat stands out about the Barclays call here, and what makes the 9% upside puzzling, is that the firm now sees close to 10 years of strong fundamentals coming down the pipe. Barclays called Facebook at best pure play in consumer Internet around the secular growth in mobile advertising.\n\nFacebook shares were up $0.96 (0.7%) at $142.72 late on Wednesday.

(on.recode.net/2gqbVbq)\n\n\"I plan to tell the president-elect that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can,\" Oracle Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz told Reuters in an emailed statement.\n\n\"If he can reform the tax code, reduce regulation, and negotiate better trade deals, the U.S. technology community will be stronger and more competitive than ever.\"\n\nAmazon.com Inc CEO and founder Jeff Bezos was also invited and is likely to attend, Recode said citing \"numerous\" sources with knowledge of the situation.\n\nFacebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAn Intel spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe gathering will take place Wednesday at Trump Tower in New York City, Recode said. (Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York; Editing by Alan Crosby)", "Reportedly, technology leaders are set to meet President-elect Donald Trump in a summit to be held on Wednesday (Dec 14, 2016).\n\nPer The Wall Street Journal, the small selective group is expected to include top-executives from Apple Inc. ( AAPL ), Alphabet Inc ( GOOGL ), Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ), Cisco Systems, Inc. ( CSCO ), Facebook Inc ( FB ), International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM ), Intel Corporation ( INTC ), Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) and Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ), along with Tesla Motors Inc’s ( TSLA ) Elon Musk.\n\nThe event is significant for the technology and allied sector as it grapples with growing uncertainty over Trump administration’s economic policies and its impact on the industry.\n\nNotably, top-most technology leaders of the Silicon Valley had openly protested against Trump’s rhetoric during election campaign. The President-elect had threatened to force technology companies like Apple to bring their overseas manufacturing operations back to the U.S.\n\nMoreover, Trump’s views over antitrust enforcement, trade protectionism, immigration policy (particularly issuance of H1B visas used to hire skilled foreigners) and net-neutrality (Donald Trump is known as a criticizer of this policy) are some of the major headwinds for the U.S. technology companies like IBM, Alphabet and Netflix, Inc. ( NFLX ).\n\nAnother concern is Trump’s determination to cut clean energy spending.\n\nMost of the big technology companies have been moving toward clean energy with the help of government tax breaks. Any spending cut will certainly be a dampener on these plans.\n\nTechnology Sector and Donald Trump – Common Ground\n\nDespite the verbal volleys and pre-election enmity, it is now quite clear that none of them — Donald Trump nor the Silicon Valley bigwigs — can ignore each other. For the sake of smooth running of their businesses as well as the U.S. economy, a “common ground” is necessary as observed by the Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Gallant.\n\nCorporate tax reform that has been blatantly advocated by the President-elect since early days of his campaign is an issue that can bring technology leaders and Donald Trump to a truce.\n\nPer data from Moody’s Investors Service Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle together made up almost 30% ($504 billion) of the $1.7 trillion in cash and cash equivalents held by U.S. non-financial companies in 2015. According to figures from the WSJ: “Apple alone holds about 91% of its $237.6 billion in cash offshore.”\n\nNotably, the U.S. government currently levies a 35% tax rate on repatriated cash, which Trump has promised to lower to 15%. An ideal restructuring of tax rates will enable companies like Apple to bring back a major part of their offshore cash to the U.S.\n\nWill Technology Stocks Rebound?\n\nSince Donald Trump’s selection (Nov 9), we note that the Zacks Computer & Technology industry has returned a modest 2.12% as compared with S&P 500 Composite’s gain of 4.22%. However, we believe that the upcoming meet will ease out some of those concerns that will eventually help the stocks to rebound.\n\nWe use our VGM Score to track technology stocks that shows characteristics to outperform the broader market. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.\n\nHere we pick four stocks that have a favorable combination of VGM score of ‘A’ and Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nMoreover, these stocks have returns of more than 15% since the election of Donald Trump.\n\nNext Page", "Bezos, Musk and Trump have sparred with one another before\n\nMain topic of meeting said to be job creation in the U.S.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos and Tesla Motors Inc. CEO Elon Musk will be among those attending President-elect Donald Trump’s gathering of technology industry leaders Wednesday in New York, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nAn invitation to the meeting went out last week from members of Trump’s transition team, including venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Oracle Corp. co-CEO Safra Catz, Cisco Systems Inc.’s Chuck Robbins and Facebook Inc. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg plan to attend. Alphabet Inc.’s Larry Page and Eric Schmidt will be there too, as will Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook, according to people familiar with the matter. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty -- who is on Trump’s advisory panel of business leaders -- will also attend, said a person familiar with her plans.\n\nThe main topic of the meeting scheduled for 2 p.m. Wednesday is likely to be job creation, one of the people said.\n\nWhile support for Trump was thin among technology executives during the presidential campaign, Bezos and Trump clashed the most publicly. The Amazon founder mockingly tweeted that he would send the Republican candidate to space on one of his rockets, and Trump accused Bezos of purchasing the Washington Post to gain political influence in the nation’s capital to help his growing e-commerce empire.\n\nBezos is doing the responsible thing for Amazon shareholders in attending the summit even though it promises to be a \"groveling session made for reality TV,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc.\n\n\"Bezos has to participate because he and his company were singled out,\" Pachter said. \"He has to be honorable and protect his shareholders.\"\n\nTechnology leaders in Silicon Valley and beyond had openly signaled an uneasiness with Trump, with most favoring Hillary Clinton -- contributions to her campaign were 114 times the level they were for Trump, according to statistics compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Over the summer, a group of about 140 industry figures sent an open letter decrying Trump’s views on immigration, internet security and government investment, which they said would stifle innovation and growth.\n\nCommon Ground\n\nOther significant issues for the industry that could be discussed are possible repatriation of overseas earnings and corporate tax reform, said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.\n\nCisco’s Robbins said those issues are among “pretty important potential changes we could see in the corporate arena” under Trump.\n\nSpeaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in response to a question about how a change in repatriation rules or tax reform would affect Cisco’s strategy, Robbins said a shift on bringing back foreign earnings is “not being positioned as a tax holiday. It would be a permanent solution which we would be very happy with.”\n\nA lower tax rate is “where I think the jobs get created,” he said. “So we’re optimistic and we’ll see how it plays out.”\n\nAtkinson said the meeting may address China, where several U.S. tech companies have struggled to find a foothold. Recode reported earlier that Sandberg would be there and that Bezos was likely to attend. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the main topic of the meeting.\n\nThe gathering will also be a chance for tech’s leaders to find some common ground with the new administration.\n\nBezos and Trump have had a long-running spat, played out largely via Twitter, beginning last December after the candidate attacked the Washington Post for publishing unflattering reports about him.\n\n“The Washington Post, which loses a fortune, is owned by Jeff Bezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, Amazon,” Trump said.\n\nIn June, Trump’s campaign revoked the Post’s press credentials, accusing the newspaper of being a front for Amazon’s political agenda. The newspaper later was the first to report on the “Access Hollywood” footage from 2005 of Trump making lewd comments about women.\n\nFollowing Trump’s victory in November, Bezos sought to strike a conciliatory tone, tweeting, \"I for one give him my most open mind.\"\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nMusk’s attendance brings a triangle of tension to the meeting. He and Bezos are both tech moguls who made their fortunes on the internet and then plowed them into space exploration. The two have sparred publicly via Twitter about the accomplishments of their space exploration companies: Musk owns Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and Bezos owns Blue Origin LLC, which are both trying to advance space exploration with rockets that can be reused like airplanes.\n\nBezos’s first-ever tweet celebrated Blue Origin sending a rocket to the edge of space and landing it back on Earth. Musk initially offered kudos, then in a subsequent message said: \"It is however, important to clear up the difference between ‘space’ and ‘orbit’\" to highlight the current technology gap between the two ventures." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1686480186480186, 0.08681547619047621, 0.09163316841888269 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.5100233100233099, 0.4942857142857142, 0.4068729385693671 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-11T18:29:49.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2016-12-13T14:27:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2016-12-12T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

(GOOG)‘s current share price. Normally this spread should be in positive territory, indicating that analysts expect an investment’s value to increase over time. So is with Alphabet Inc.. The median target of analyst views collected by Yahoo Finance was as much as $187.92 below GOOG’s recent stock price. That’s the optimistic view from Wall Street.\n\nThe stock has actually made strong gains in the past year, as the company has gathered a 10.77% return in the past twelve months. But even with this move, there is still plenty of room for the company to come back from a longer term perspective, and especially if we look to recent lows for the company as well.\n\nThe company’s share price is down -4.39% from previous highs of around $853.5 per share on March 21, 2017. On the bright side, the company’s share price has been on the rebound, up more than 51.6% since hitting lows of $663.28 on June 27, 2016.\n\nFinally, from a technical perspective, there’s a strong possibility that the stock could enter into a new bull market after finding strong support between $807.16 and $812.37. In terms of pullbacks, $822.68 level is the first resistance point. Technical analysis can help recognize key technical price levels in the stock. Investors can use these support and resistance levels to refine their entries and exits from stocks.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) price is pointing towards neither exit nor entry barriers, according to a technical analysis tool called the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Last session Alphabet Inc. RSI was seen at 36.61. RSI measures the speed and change of a stock price to warn investors when a stock’s momentum has carried it too far. An RSI reading above 80 indicates that a stock is overbought while anything below 20 is oversold.\n\nWith these kinds of figures it is worthy to note that Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has been put into a buy territory, but there are few other spots to consider. The Stochastic %K for GOOG is 20.65. Stochastics is a momentum indicator that uses basic support and resistance levels and integrates with the trend to give accurate buy or sell signals to traders. For stochastics, readings below 20 are considered oversold and you would only take buy signals if the indicator is below that level. A value of 80 is considered overbought and sell signals occurring below that level would be ignored. This leads to longer trades and should result in fewer losses.”)\n\n14-day Williams %R for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) moved to around 87.1. The interpretation of Williams %R is very similar to that of the stochastic oscillator, except that the stochastic oscillator has internal smoothing. The oscillator ranges from 0 to -100. No matter how fast a security advances or declines, Williams %R will always fluctuate within this range. Overbought and oversold levels can be used to identify unsustainable price extremes. Simply put, readings in the range of 80% to 100% indicate that the security is oversold while readings in the 0% to 20% range suggest it is overbought." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.08666105499438832 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4170229276895943 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-03-24T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

Google is using its aftermath to burnish its bona fides in Trump's political orbit.\n\nThe Alphabet Inc. unit posted a job listing for a manager of \"conservative outreach\" on its policy team 10 days after the election. The company is searching for a Washington veteran to \"tell Google’s story in an elevator or from a podium,\" according to the description on Google's career website.\n\n\"As a member of Google's Public Policy outreach team, you will act as Google’s liaison to conservative, libertarian and free market groups,\" the listing reads. \"You are part organizer, part advocate and part policy wonk as you understand the world of third-party non-governmental advocacy organizations.\"\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nGoogle has hired former Republican operatives before and this job isn't new (the previous policy specialist in the role once worked on Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign). But the listing suggests the internet giant is mobilizing to push its multi-faceted agenda with the incoming administration. Google is likely to voice positions on several key political issues, including data encryption, antitrust, telecom rules and autonomous vehicles. On several of them, Trump's policies are uncertain.\n\nThe company has kept relatively quiet since the election. In an interview with the BBC the week after, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai noted how the results reflected a deep divide in the U.S. \"We need to figure out how to constructively engage with the new administration and hear the voices of people,\" Pichai told the British broadcaster. A Google spokesman declined to comment on Monday.\n\nPrior to the election, Eric Schmidt, Alphabet's chairman, was more vocal, expressing willingness to help Hillary Clinton's campaign, according to e-mails obtained by WikiLeaks. He was photographed at a Clinton gathering on the evening of the election wearing a \"staff\" badge.\n\nAlthough Google eschewed lobbying in its early years, it has turned into one of the largest corporate forces in Washington. Alphabet has spent $11.9 million so far this year, ranking it in the top five among U.S. companies, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nIts top lobbyist is Susan Molinari, a former Republican Congresswoman from New York. Her father, Guy Molinari, a luminary in the state's party, spoke out against Trump in 2015. In September, he told a New York City newspaper he was reversing his position and endorsing the party's nominee.", "Google is looking to hire a \"conservative outreach\" manager based in Washington D.C., for its public policy team, to act as the company's \"liaison to conservative, libertarian and free market groups\" following Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election.\n\nA job post on Google's careers page says there is an opening for someone who can \"tell Google’s story in an elevator or from a podium\" and work to advance Google's public policy goals with partner organizations on shared projects. Applicants need to have a minimum of eight years of direct experience in or around national politics, either in government or in advocacy roles, as well as direct experience working with conservative groups, advocacy organizations, think tanks and foundations on issue campaigns or public policy advocacy.\n\nGoogle has hired Republican operatives in the past, including a former policy specialist who worked on Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, Bloomberg reports. The company, which falls under the Alphabet Inc. conglomerate, has a financial interest in influencing public policy particularly concerning privacy and Internet usage.\n\nLast month, Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, told the BBC that the U.S. was \"deeply divided\" in the wake of Trump's surprising victory. \"I tend to look forward and I think we need to figure out how to constructively engage with the new administration and hear the voices of people,\" he said." ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1243371212121212, 0.08456439393939394 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3557765151515151, 0.2482007575757576 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2016-12-05T00:00:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2016-12-06T00:00:00.000+0000" } ] }

Prior to the reported new employment, she was the vice president of government policy at eBay and before that, she served as Yahoo’s deputy general counsel and held key policy positions at AOL.\n\nMawakana’s hire has come at a time when Google plans to sue Uber over stealing one of its designs via the company’s former engineer, Anthony Levandowski. She would, however, be focused on handling government policy rather than private litigation.\n\nGoogle’s self-driving project has been in the works ever since it was first showcased at the Google I/O 2011. The company seems to have taken a different approach to self-driving technology compared to Uber.

(NASDAQ: AMZN)'s CEO Jeff Bezos, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)'s chairman Eric Schmidt and Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA)'s CEO Elon Musk were among the most visible. There was, however, one name many investors may not be familiar with: Alex Karp.\n\nKarp runs a private Silicon Valley company called Palantir Technologies, is a software developer who received backing from the CIA's venture capital arm and has held contracts with other government agencies.\n\nCoincident or not, the relatively unknown company was co-founded by Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley investor, Trump supporter and member of his transition team.\n\nAs noted by CNBC, every company that took part in Trump's tech summit was valued at more than $100 billion with the exception of Tesla and Palantir which is valued at just $20 billion.\n\n\"I don't like the way it looks having Karp in that room,\" Norman Eisen, a former U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic who worked on President Barack Obama's ethics initiatives told CNBC. \"Even if it had a much larger market cap or if he were a much bigger personality, it still looks as if [Thiel] is using the transition for personal advancement.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the argument can also be made that Silicon Valley is small enough for these types of connections to occur at many companies. For example, Thiel was an early backer in Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) and the social media empire sent its chief operations officer Sheryl Sandberg to represent the company at the meeting.\n\nPosted-In: Alex KarpNews Politics Events Movers Tech Media General Best of Benzinga\n\n© 2017 Benzinga.com.

(NasdaqGS:GOOGL)\n\nInvestors considering positions in Alphabet Inc. (NasdaqGS:GOOGL), might be interested in the Gross Margin Score of the company. The shares currently have a score of 5.00000. This score is derived from the Gross Margin (Marx) stability and growth over the previous eight years. The Gross Margin score lands on a scale from 1 to 100 where a score of 1 would be considered positive, and a score of 100 would be seen as negative. The low score of 5.00000 for Alphabet Inc. indicates a top score for stability and growth.\n\nChecking in on some valuation rankings, Alphabet Inc. (NasdaqGS:GOOGL) has a Value Composite score of 59. Developed by James O’Shaughnessy, the VC score uses five valuation ratios. These ratios are price to earnings, price to cash flow, EBITDA to EV, price to book value, and price to sales. The VC is displayed as a number between 1 and 100. In general, a company with a score closer to 0 would be seen as undervalued, and a score closer to 100 would indicate an overvalued company. Adding a sixth ratio, shareholder yield, we can view the Value Composite 2 score which is currently sitting at 62.\n\nAfter a recent scan, we can see that Alphabet Inc. (NasdaqGS:GOOGL) has a Shareholder Yield of -0.002204 and a Shareholder Yield (Mebane Faber) of 0.00196. The first value is calculated by adding the dividend yield to the percentage of repurchased shares. The second value adds in the net debt repaid yield to the calculation. Shareholder yield has the ability to show how much money the firm is giving back to shareholders via a few different avenues. Companies may issue new shares and buy back their own shares. This may occur at the same time. Investors may also use shareholder yield to gauge a baseline rate of return.\n\nAt the time of writing, Alphabet Inc. (NasdaqGS:GOOGL) has a Piotroski F-Score of 7. The F-Score may help discover companies with strengthening balance sheets. The score may also be used to spot the weak performers. Joseph Piotroski developed the F-Score which employs nine different variables based on the company financial statement. A single point is assigned to each test that a stock passes. Typically, a stock scoring an 8 or 9 would be seen as strong. On the other end, a stock with a score from 0-2 would be viewed as weak.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NasdaqGS:GOOGL) has a current ERP5 Rank of 4143 . The ERP5 Rank may assist investors with spotting companies that are undervalued. This ranking uses four ratios. These ratios are Earnings Yield, ROIC, Price to Book, and 5 year average ROIC. When looking at the ERP5 ranking, it is generally considered the lower the value, the better.\n\nShifting gears, we can see that Alphabet Inc. (NasdaqGS:GOOGL) has a Q.i. Value of 36.00000. The Q.i. Value ranks companies using four ratios. These ratios consist of EBITDA Yield, FCF Yield, Liquidity, and Earnings Yield. The purpose of the Q.i. Value is to help identify companies that are the most undervalued.

Waymo declined to comment on Uber's filing.\n\nThe court fight has intensified Alphabet's rivalry with Uber, one of the Internet giant's largest investments, and reflects an escalating talent war in the burgeoning autonomous-driving arena as tech and auto companies alike compete for skilled engineers. sentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nBoth companies believe the robocar market will be worth hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars a year.\n\nIf the central claims in the high-stakes case are moved into arbitration, the proceedings would be closed to the public.\n\nMr Levandowski, who now heads Uber's self-driving division, was accused by Waymo of downloading 14,000 confidential files before he resigned in January 2016. He isn't named as a defendant in Waymo's February lawsuit.\n\nInstead, Waymo sued only Uber and Otto, the self-driving startup formed by Mr Levandowski and acquired by Uber in August for US$680 million.\n\nUber has said it wants to keep fighting Waymo's patent-infringement claims in court, while moving the allegations of trade-secret theft and unfair competition into arbitration.\n\nThe San Francisco-based startup also contends Waymo's decision to omit Mr Levandowski as a defendant was a deliberate end run around his contract to keep the case in court.\n\n\"Waymo especially should not be allowed to avoid arbitration where it has alleged pervasive collusion between Levandowski\" and Uber, especially as the claims are founded on alleged misconduct by the engineer while he was a Waymo employee, Uber said in its filing.\n\nThe company also noted that Mr Levandowski was mentioned by name 35 times in Waymo's amended complaint filed March 10.\n\nUber said Mr Levandowski's arbitration agreement applies to \"all disputes with anyone\" arising out of his employment with Waymo, which was spun off in December from Google to its parent, Alphabet.\n\nUber also contends its own bid for arbitration is supported by Waymo's use of the same process against Mr Levandowski.\n\nCharlotte Garden, an associate law professor at Seattle University who's been following litigation involving Uber, said it's significant that Uber itself isn't part of the arbitration agreement it's trying to invoke.\n\nWhile the language in that agreement is \"quite broad,\" it may not go as far as Uber asserts, she said Wednesday.\n\n\"There is at least some ambiguity about whether that language was intended to cover only disputes between Levandowski and people or entities that were related to Google, rather than between Google and the entire world.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.04736842105263157 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4344298245614035 ], "publish_date" : [ null ] }

NBCUniversal executives unveiled the Snap partnership to advertisers Wednesday as part of the annual ad sales presentations known as the “upfronts.”\n\nAs in the prior deal, NBC will be able to sell ad slots on its Snapchat video content.

He said the vast majority of that audience was under the age of 35.\n\n“We will take to the market and into our Olympic discussions that unique opportunity to get in front of a very young audience during the period of the Games,” Mr. Zenkel said.\n\nSnap’s ability to show momentum in attracting ad dollars is key to its growth and to supporting its valuation of over $24 billion. Some analysts expect the company will reach revenue of $1 billion in 2017, more than double the $404 million it generated last year. But it is operating in a highly competitive environment in which giants Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.s’ Google are sucking up digital ad dollars.\n\nAhead of the IPO, the company had been courting Madison Avenue aggressively. It met with media-buying arms of ad giants including WPP WPPGY +0.37% PLC, Omnicom Group Inc., Publicis Groupe SA, and Interpublic Group of Co s., seeking ad-spending commitments of $100 million to $200 million from each firm for 2017, roughly double or triple what these firms spent on the platform in 2016.\n\nSnap went public at $17 a share earlier this month. While its stock has been volatile in recent weeks, it has stayed above the IPO price and was at $22 in early afternoon trading Wednesday.\n\nWrite to Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.com and Maureen Farrell at maureen.farrell@wsj.com" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.1158253588516746 ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3770175438596491 ], "publish_date" : [ null ] }
