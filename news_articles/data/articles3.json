This one was for the launch of the Galaxy S8, the company's flagship smartphone. This is a make-or-break moment for Samsung - at least where it comes to its position as the world's biggest smartphone maker.\n\nSource: Samsung\n\nThis is the time where Samsung has to convince consumers to forget about the Galaxy Note 7, exploding battery and all.\n\nThe Galaxy S8 is the phone that will take on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and its 10th anniversary iPhone 8 (or iPhone Edition ). And it has to hold off Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and its Google Pixel Phone. In other words, there's a lot riding on the Galaxy S8.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Samsung's most important smartphone, ever.\n\nGalaxy S8: Near Bezel-Free Infinity Display, No Home Button\n\nApple isn't the only one working to banish bezels and buttons from its phones. Samsung had the same idea and this year it's taken big steps in that direction. Its new Galaxy flagship has no side bezels - just screen right to the curved edge - and its greatly reduced them at the top and bottom. It calls this the Infinity Display - a name Dell sort of already coined with its XPS 13 laptop.\n\nThis requires a pressure-sensitive virtual home button located beneath the display, and moving the fingerprint scanner to the back. The hardware buttons along the edges do remain, resulting in a huge display housed within a relatively small form factor. Although, adding vertical space has resulted in a \"stretched\" aspect ratio. Samsung does note it has worked with Google to ensure that extra screen real estate gets used. The display isn't just big, it's sharp and is the first to get mobile HDR certification.\n\nTwo Sizes\n\nThe Galaxy S8 comes in two sizes. This time the Galaxy S8+ features the same design as its smaller sibling (unlike last year where the larger model got a curved Edge display), built around the Infinity Display. With that new design, the plus model offers a whopping 6.2-inch display, while even the standard Galaxy S8 has a 5.8-inch screen - without getting cumbersome (thanks to minimizing the bezels).\n\nIn comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus display is 5.5-inches.\n\nBixby to Take on Siri and Google Assistant\n\nAI-powered virtual assistants have become key features on smartphones. Apple has Siri and Android has Google Assistant - although Google did keep that as a Pixel Phone exclusive for a few months.\n\nLikely in response to that Google exclusivity move, last fall Samsung bought Viv , an AI startup from the creators of Siri. That acquisition paid off with Bixby, Samsung's own AI agent. Samsung considers Bixby important enough that the company previewed the technology a week before the Galaxy S8 launch, and also gave Bixby a dedicated button on the new Galaxy smartphone.\n\nWhere Siri and Google Assistant are focused on answering questions and helping users to accomplish tasks, Bixby does this to an extent, but is currently positioned more as a helper to make using supported applications easier.\n\nKey Galaxy S8 Specs\n\nAs is expected with a new generation of a smartphone, the new Galaxy receives significant hardware upgrades, including a snappy new CPU.\n\nQuad HD+ Super AMOLED Infinity Display with HDR support (5.8-inches and 6.2-inches)\n\nQualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Snapdragon 835 CPU with 4GB RAM\n\n(NASDAQ: ) Snapdragon 835 CPU with 4GB RAM 64GB storage, expandable using microSD cards\n\n12-MP dual-pixel primary camera, 8-MP front camera\n\nFace recognition security\n\nIris scanner biometric security\n\nIP 68 dust and water resistant\n\n3000mAh battery (3500mAh for S8+) with fast charging\n\nGigabit LTE and Gigabit Wi-Fi ready\n\nUSB-C\n\n3.5mm audio jack\n\nWireless charging optional\n\nOptional DeX dock for use with keyboard and monitor\n\nSamsung Pay, Samsung Pass support\n\nHigh performance, $99 ear-buds tuned by Harman included\n\nWeigh 5.3 ounces and\n\nAvailable in black sky, orchid gray, arctic silver, coral blue, maple gold\n\nSamsung Connect\n\nSamsung is making a play for the smart home. Samsung Connect is a take on Apple's iOS Home app - and like Siri, Bixby can use it to control your smart devices by voice. But while Apple dropped out of the router business, Samsung is introducing its own, the Samsung Connect Home mesh router.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nYou've seen Samsung's new flagship smartphone and it looks pretty impressive. But how much does it cost? And when can you get your hands on one?\n\nThe Galaxy S8 goes for $750, while the Galaxy S8+ will set you back $850 (carriers may sell for less). Both models are available for pre-order starting March 30, and will go on sale beginning April 21. Samsung will also be selling a new, improved Gear VR headset and controller (free with pre-orders) and a new version of its Gear 360 VR camera.\n\nIs the New Galaxy S8 Good Enough?\n\nThe big question, of course, is whether the new Galaxy S8 is good enough: Good enough to take on Google's smartphone ambitions with its Pixel Phone; good enough to hold its own against the iPhone 8; and perhaps most importantly, good enough to finally put the Galaxy Note 7 behind it.\n\nWe should have a good idea once SSNLF releases Galaxy S8 launch sales numbers. But based on what we saw at today's Samsung Unpacked event, the company has a real shot at staging a smartphone comeback.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Samsung (SSNLF) Introduces the Galaxy S8 With Infinity Display appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Last year, Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) made a big splash when it won the rights to stream 10 of the NFL's Thursday Night Football games. The social network quickly sold all of its ad inventory for the games, and it was immensely profitable for the company (if at a relatively small scale). Twitter reportedly sought to bring in $50 million in ad revenue from its content partnership with the NFL, and probably exceeded its goal. Considering it paid just $10 million for the streaming rights, that's a good deal.\n\nBut there's no guarantee the NFL will renew its deal with Twitter. Other big tech companies like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google are also reportedly interested in the rights as well. Let's take a look at what Thursday Night Football might mean to each interested company.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nTwitter\n\nTwitter knows what it's getting with the NFL and the NFL knows what it's getting with Twitter. Twitter has a relatively broad established global audience that already talks a lot about sports on its social network. Last year's results show that at least a few of them are willing to stream the game on the same platform they go to talk about it.\n\nBut Twitter's viewership numbers may have been a bit disappointing, particularly for advertisers. Twitter averaged just 200,000 to 300,000 viewers per game on average. Twitter prefers to point to the 3.5 million unique viewers per game on average, but the television ratings standard use average audience. By comparison, the television broadcasts consistently had over 10 million viewers and even topped 20 million viewers on occasion.\n\nThose ratings are noteworthy because marketers paid quite a bit for Twitter's ads -- around $250,000 for a package of 20 ads during the games and some pre-roll ads on NFL highlights. That's nearly half of what advertisers paid for the television broadcasts to reach an audience about 2% the size. Twitter is switching to guaranteed viewership on some video ads, so the NFL deal might not be as lucrative for Twitter this time around.\n\nFacebook\n\nFacebook offers similar benefits to the NFL as Twitter, but it has a scale that's five times larger. While Twitter is generally considered the place to discuss live sports events, Facebook still has the potential to attract a much broader and engaged audience. Facebook boasts that its users spend 50 minutes per day on average across Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. With a broad portfolio of apps, Facebook should be able to promote and attract a much bigger audience than Twitter.\n\nA deal with the NFL could help Facebook seed its dedicated video section. The company is interested in paying for premium video content to attract users to watch and upload more video to the social network. Facebook is also testing midroll video ads to directly monetize videos on its platform, and Thursday Night Football could provide a nice playground for the ad format.\n\nAmazon\n\nWhile Amazon doesn't sport the same audience as Facebook or even Twitter, it's certainly willing to pay up for the NFL streaming rights. In fact, it offered $15 million for the rights last year, $5 million more than Twitter ended up paying. The NFL ended up going with Twitter for its ability to reach a global audience.\n\nBut things have changed at Amazon over the last year. Most notably, Amazon expanded Prime Video globally in December. It's also been negotiating for the rights to stream sports that are less popular in the U.S., but very popular internationally like auto racing and soccer. If Amazon can put together a package of sports rights for its international subscribers, becoming a destination to stream games, it could convince the NFL to take a shot with it.\n\nOf course, the NFL will likely stipulate that Amazon stream the games to everyone, not just Prime subscribers. Nonetheless, Amazon could use it as a marketing tool for Prime Video as well as way to grow its burgeoning advertising business .\n\nYouTube\n\nYouTube is currently facing some backlash for placing ads next to objectionable content. A deal with the NFL could provide a boost to YouTube's reputation as a place for premium digital video content. At the same time, YouTube's current reputation struggles could deter the NFL from making a deal in the first place, as the league is very brand conscious.\n\nYouTube is making a play for more television ad dollars, particularly with the impending release of YouTube Unplugged, its over-the-top linear television service. The company will already be selling television advertising for YouTube Unplugged, and it could use Google's ad targeting data to maximize its ad revenue. That factor will put it at the top of the list for its ability to successfully monetize an investment in Thursday Night Football, which could enable it to come in with the highest bid among the companies in this article.\n\nOverall, each company has a lot to gain from winning the rights to Thursday Night Football. Twitter certainly has the most to lose if it doesn't win, considering analysts already expect a decline in ad revenue this year. The NFL is expected to announce a winner in the next month or so, since it announced the Twitter deal last April.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Twitter\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The acronym covers popular stocks like Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) - formerly Google, making up the \"G.\" But after delving into that from 10,000 feet, I wanted to jump specifically into GOOGL stock.\n\nI was very upbeat about Alphabet in the assessment. Despite the optimism, though, we suggested waiting for a pullback. In fact, our very words were :\n\n\"At just a hair under all-time highs, now may not be the best time to buy. A retest of its 50-day moving average near $840 and a further decline to its 200-day moving average near $800 would offer better entry opportunities.\"\n\nSo with GOOGL stock stumbling of late, where does it leave us?\n\nAccording to the charts, right where we wanted.\n\nAlphabet's Issues\n\nAlphabet's YouTube ran some controversial ads. Running alongside them, though, included ads from McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD ), AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) and others. As a result, many of these brands have pulled or suspended their advertisements with the search and video giant. That sounds like bad news, and at least temporarily, it is.\n\nThe news pushed Alphabet stock below its 50-day moving average for the first time since late-December. However, my first thought was immediately that if one didn't want to buy the stock immediately after the breach of the 50-day MA, they could wait until it hit the 100- or 200-day moving averages, or safer still, wait for a bounce.\n\nThat's just what we've gotten.\n\n\n\nGOOGL stock has since rebounded off the 100-day and is now challenging its 50-day moving average. A breakthrough here would mean enormous things for the stock, including a push toward all-time highs.\n\nWe took a look at Alphabet's technical aspects, but what about its fundamentals?\n\nWhat Makes GOOGL Stock Look So Good?\n\nWhen we sorted through the FANG stocks, Alphabet was our favorite in regards to fundamentals.\n\nFirst, consider its brand. There is no question who is the undisputed leader in search. There's a reason people don't say, \"I don't know, Bing it.\" Or \"who knows, just Ask Jeeves.\" Google is the king of search and until the internet dies, it's unlikely GOOGL will either.\n\nIn fact, Alphabet's Google site is the most visited website in the world. Interestingly enough, its YouTube property is ranked second. Even Google.co.in - the Google used in India - is ranked seventh in the world.\n\nAlphabet has a grip so strong it's unlikely it will ever be broken. For a long-term shareholder in GOOGL, that's money in the bank.\n\nAs the quarters and years go by, Alphabet's core businesses will continue to line investors' pockets. Its consistency is attractive, but other bets look promising too.\n\nFor better or for worse, Alphabet takes some chances known as \"moonshots.\" Take for instance, the company's self-driving car business. Alphabet's been at this one for a long time. Renamed Waymo, the unit has been making breakthroughs, which is very promising in this suddenly strong growth market. Without moonshots, Waymo would have never been created. It's what makes Google, Google.\n\nHowever, these moonshots can be bad news when they don't pan out and cost too much money. The minds that started Google changed the internet forever. And while they're excellent product people, they didn't make for the best financial overseers.\n\nBring in CFO Ruth Porat, and that changes. Porat left Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) and joined Alphabet in May 2015. The stock, stagnant for a year, boomed 50% in the 18 months following her hire.\n\nStreaky earnings results were replaced with consistent beats. She tightened budgets in a way that curbed careless spending yet still gave teams the flexibility they needed. Alphabet now has better transparency with the Street as well as a share buyback.\n\nThe Bottom Line for Alphabet\n\nPerhaps the best part of GOOGL stock is the valuation. While not cheap necessarily, the valuation is reasonable. Trading with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21, Alphabet is forecast to grow earnings 19.3% annually for the next five years.\n\nThrow in expectations for ~18% and ~15.5% respective sales growth for this year and next, and Alphabet becomes even more attractive.\n\nWith a stellar brand, reasonable current valuation, long-term growth and strong management, GOOGL is poised for success well into the future.\n\nLuckily, investors now have a chance to buy.\n\nBret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips .

Additionally, in partnership with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Nvidia announced development of the HGX-1 Hyperscale GPU Accelerator , which promises improved performance and standardization for cloud-computing servers.\n\nSource: Nvidia\n\nThese tools will also serve NVDA stock investors (indirectly, of course), as they further the company's rise to the top of the AI industry ladder.\n\nAndroid Central described the Jetson TX2 best, saying :\n\n\"The people who will build this technology of the future will need the tools to do so. In 2017, NVIDIA is doing its part, and the Jetson TX2 is the embodiment of this idea.\"\n\nSimply put, the Jetson TX2 is a mini supercomputer that can process massive amounts of data on the spot, which can be a huge advantage for technology developers who would otherwise have had to upload all that data to an online server for cloud computing.\n\nWhat's more, NVDA's Jetson TX2 is capable of \"edge\" machine learning, a term that refers to the ability of the module to process, interpret and analyze data without the need to first upload it to the cloud, then download the resulting information and details. The TX2 has served its purpose quite successfully and it has helped Nvidia achieve its goal of simplifying developers' processes by reducing the number of steps required to garner important data.\n\nAs far as the HGX-1, NVDA believes that:\n\nThe HGX-1 hyperscale GPU accelerator will do for AI cloud computing what the ATX standard did to make PCs pervasive today. It will enable cloud-service providers to easily adopt NVIDIA GPUs to meet surging demand for AI computing.\n\nMore Iconic Brands Rely on NVDA Than You Might Realize\n\nHistorically, Nvidia has been known for its industry-leading graphics cards. But, NVDA stock is much more than a computer GPU maker. Sure, the company still produces some of the most advanced GPUs that make hardcore gamers drool, but graphics processors are actually capable of much more.\n\nWhile high-end GPUs will, obviously, improve PC video quality and reduce or eliminate that annoying screen lag when you're playing a first-person shooter game, they're also used for a surprising number of non-visual applications.\n\nFor instance, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) use Nvidia GPU technology in the development of their respective driverless cars. Volkswagen AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS: VLKAY ) and Daimler AG's (OTCMKTS: DDAIF ) Audi brand have also been using Nvidia GPU units in their own driverless vehicle development projects. These companies use the NVDA Drive PX2 - which, according to Forbes , shares the renowned Tegra Parker silicon as the Jetson TX2 .\n\nBeyond just autonomous vehicles, though, Nvidia GPU devices have been used by medical scientists and pharmaceutical companies to investigate and better understand the effects of aging. Using GPUs made by NVDA, biotech companies such as InSilico employ AI to analyze large data sets and \"emulate human brain function\" in an attempt to combat diseases related to old age and reduce the cost of healthcare.\n\nSimilarly, at its annual Open Compute Project summit earlier this month, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) announced a cutting-edge AI server dubbed Big Basin, which features \"no less than eight Nvidia Tesla P100 GPU accelerators.\"\n\nBottom Line on NVDA Stock\n\nAll things considered, Nvidia stock's meteoric rise in the field of artificial intelligence shows no signs of slowing. With the release of the Jetson TX2 module, coupled with the upcoming HGX-1 accelerator, NVDA stock has addressed - seemingly quite successfully - mobile/field R&D as well as the cloud computing needs of AI developers.\n\nFor Nvidia stock, this is a solid sign that the past year's 213% gains will continue.\n\nAs of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Why Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Will Keep Jumping Higher appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOne of the key reasons Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) - while it was still called Google - grew from nothing to an advertising behemoth in just a few years lies in the fact that much of what it offered was automated. Without the need for human intervention, it could cost-effectively offer ad space to advertisers with the click of a button (and payment, of course). This did wonders for GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: Brionv via Wikimedia (Modified)\n\nThere does come a time, however, when a \"hands off\" approach to … well, pretty much everything can cause problems.\n\nAlphabet stock holders were made well aware of that reality just last week when a couple of advertisers suspended their ad spending at YouTube when it was realized their advertisements prefaced some distasteful hate speech that surfaced at the popular online video venue.\n\nIn its defense, the company didn't know. As was noted, ad placements are essentially automated. On the other hand, it's arguable to say GOOGL should have known something like that could happen, and prevention measures should have been put in place. The debacle may force Alphabet to operate its advertising service with at least a little more human involvement.\n\nA Big Mistake for GOOGL Stock?\n\nAlthough several companies pulled the plug on their YouTube ads, AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) were a couple of the bigger names that called it quits … at least for the time being.\n\nThere was no specific event that prompted the boycotts, nor is it a brand new realization. But, the matter had been boiling over for a couple of weeks now, with an anti-Semitic clip video called \"Jewish World Order\" serving as the poster child of how vile the digital video venue can be, and how damning the power of association can be to a brand.\n\nIt's theoretically not supposed to happen. Aside from the fact that ads are intended to be targeted to a plausible potential customer, but knowing that automated filters aren't perfect, human judgment can also play a role in determining the appropriateness of an ad placement. Still, that's clearly not working either.\n\nAlphabet responded:\n\n\"We don't comment on individual customers but as announced, we've begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear. We're also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers' brands.\"\n\nIt's the right thing to do, but a little too late.\n\nImpact on Alphabet Stock\n\nAnd it's not just an embarrassing gaffe that will blow over, as most do. Nomura Instinet believes the advertiser boycott will shave $750 million off of the company's top line over the course of the remainder of 2017 .\n\nThat, however, isn't much in the grand scheme of things.\n\nYouTube was projected to drive $7.7 billion in revenue for that three-quarter stretch. Alphabet has done $90.3 billion in revenue for the last four quarters. Of course, inasmuch as YouTube isn't profitable, the impact on the per-share profits of GOOGL stock may be nil.\n\nNot all analysts are convinced the high-profile flub is going to do any lasting damage, however. Morgan Stanley calculates that the affected part of the company's ad business only makes up 10% of the organization's revenue machine , and boasts millions of advertisers. RBC Capital's math follows up on Nomura's calculation, pointing out that even in the event of a 10% lull in that arm's revenue, it would still only translate into a 1.7% lull in total revenue.\n\nBottom Line for GOOGL Stock\n\nIt's still not clear what, if anything, Alphabet specifically intends to do about the miscue and the subsequent fallout. And the plausible fiscal impact of the damage done is little more than guesswork at this point. Those matters, however, may be secondary.\n\nWhile Google may still be the king of search and display ads and GOOGL stock is still one of the top picks in the industry, this is another dent in the company's reputation - and its operation. The automated approach of pairing up ads and publishers was clever when it was the only option, but the whole business of internet advertising has changed. Alphabet stock didn't change enough with it.\n\nCase in point: Last year, an internet advertising arrangement called Header Bidding became all the rage. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) took that ball and ran with it … and customers love it . Rather than adapt on the future of digital display ads, GOOGL doubled down on its version of the ad-selling approach that distinctly lacks the transparency so many Header Bidding users love. Most observers expect Alphabet stock to lose market share as long as it refuses to face Facebook head-on.\n\nNone of this means GOOGL stock is doomed, but between being lapped by Facebook and now clearly being unable to guarantee appropriate ad placements to its biggest customers, investors should start to ask some tough questions about Alphabet's sales and delivery model.\n\nAs of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Might Have a Chink in Its Armor appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "As self-proclaimed smart investors, we should always be looking between the cracks to find the stocks that are either revolutionary, innovative or so disruptive to an industry it causes a technological or systematic shift from the way things get done. Apple ( AAPL ) changed the way we communicate, Amazon ( AMZN ) changed the way consumers shop and Alphabet 's ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) Google changed the way people use the internet to find an infinite wealth of information within a second of pressing a button on a keyboard. But, there is always room for more disruptions.\n\nHere's the new kid on the block, Aqua Metals Inc. ( AQMS ), a company that may be on the verge of joining this list of disruptive elite to become the first and only company that has the technological capacity to reinvent the lead-acid recycling industry. As far as Aqua Metals is concerned, smelting, the environmentally poisonous method of recycling lead from used and discarded batteries, should be a thing of the past. With the patent-pending AquaRefining method, not only is the company's method a technological breakthrough, it is one that can be quickly endorsed and sponsored by both lawmakers and environmentalists alike. Even legislators supported by the fat wallet lobbyists will have a hard time explaining why they do not support this method of extracting lead-acids over existing and now antiquated ones.\n\nAquaRefining uses water\n\nThe technology is very advanced and, without a doubt, may be hard to comprehend at first glance. How is this for innovation - the technology uses room-temperature water to extract and recycle lead-acid from batteries. Vastly different from smelting, the patent-pending AquaRefining technology is a room-temperature, water-based process that is fundamentally non-polluting. Because of this non-firing method, the modular systems not only allow the extraction of lead-acid compounds, but simultaneously improve environmental impact and provide the ability to scale production to meet rapidly growing demand for lead-acid based products.\n\nBuilding the first AquaRefining facility in Nevada's Tahoe Reno Industrial Complex, the company's focus is to reduce the refining inefficiency, costs and toxic waste associated with conventional smelter-based recycling of lead-acid batteries. The technology not only delivers a breakthrough process, but it also produces a better product at a higher yield and eliminates toxic waste. Of additional value is the process significantly reduces the permitting process. Building a new AquaRefining facility requires a substantially smaller capital expenditure over the construction of smelting facilities.\n\nIndustry endorsements\n\nThe stock is now trading at $18.15 a share, up from approximately $13 at the start of the year. While the stock has been reacting extremely well over the past several months, Aqua Metals is still somewhat under the radar as far as retail investors are concerned. That is not to say the recycling industry is not recognizing the potential for this company to grow exponentially over the next decade, as well as being able to provide significant and beneficial environmental impact from its processes.\n\nAqua Metals received prestigious recognition from the ICIC Innovation Awards in 2016, was the winner of the Sustainable Technology Award at the IChem Global Awards in 2016 and is a 2016 Platts Global Award Winner in 2016. Apparently, the company is not some alchemist's dream of turning sand into gold. To the contrary, it has already proven its technology, is advancing its strategy and has already become a revenue-producing company.\n\nBolstering confidence, in February of this year the company signed a breakthrough agreement with Johnson Controls (JCI), which provided a tremendous first step forward in working with global leaders in the responsible recycling of automotive batteries. Under the terms of the agreement, Johnson Controls will become the first licensee for AquaRefining technology. In doing so, Johnson Controls will supply the company with batteries to recycle as a service, and Aqua Metals will be part of a closed-loop cycle with Johnson Controls. Additionally, Johnson Controls will purchase AquaRefined metals produced by the company and has also agreed to buy just under 5% of its outstanding shares of common stock.\n\nFurthermore, Interstate Batteries, an industry giant, has also taken a substantial interest in the company, purchasing a stake in Aqua Metals as well. Under the terms of the agreements made in 2016, Interstate Batteries has agreed to supply more than a million automotive and other lead-acid batteries as feedstock for Aqua Metals' AquaRefineries. Interstate Batteries will also make a strategic investment of approximately $10 million into Aqua Metals. This strategic investment will be in the form of common stock, a fixed-price note that converts into common stock and two cash warrants to purchase common stock over the next three years. It should be pointed out that, as part of a diversification strategy, Interstate Batteries recently adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan to reduce its ownership stake in Aqua Metals by 430,000 shares, with proposed sales offered at its discretion.\n\nGetting the lead out\n\nIndustry disruption is good. For investors seeking a ground floor breakthrough opportunity, Aqua Metals may offer the closest thing to newly discovered alien technology on the planet. While I am an Area 51 enthusiast, making the comparison to otherworldly technology is not so off the wall. Aqua Metals is on the verge of replacing decades worth of old technology, substantially reducing toxic waste and environmental damage and replacing a process that is significantly more costly than what the company can deliver in a simpler fashion. And, it is doing this by using room-temperature water, a process that should soon make it into Ripley's Believe It or Not! Hall of Fame.\n\nInvestors should also appreciate the stakes taken by both Johnson Controls and Interstate, which may ultimately lead to additional support for the stock moving forward. Although Interstate is divesting some of its stake for diversification purposes, Johnson has not demonstrated the same willingness to let go of its stake.\n\nIn simplest terms, being disruptive prevents a company from being disrupted. If Aqua Metals was nothing more than a stock in the brainstorming and proof-of-concept phase, investor caution might be more warranted. That is not the case however.\n\nAqua Metals has the processes and facility in place, is producing revenue and its technology is being embraced globally. In that sense, if investors decide to get the lead out and invest at current share price levels, that decision appears to be well supported by industry experts and environmental watchdogs - two factions that have the ability to promote a peaceful transfer of power in the industry. In that respect, Aqua Metals' method of extraction may be both well received and endorsed, providing continued momentum for the company going forward.\n\nDisclosure: I have no shares in any stock mentioned in this article and no plans to open any positions over the next 72 hours.\n\n[This article was originally featured on CNA Finance]\n\nStart afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks look to start their climb higher this morning, though just slightly. All three of the major indices touched-up on their respective 50-day moving averages during trading yesterday to find some support. This is the first time that technicals have had to step in as support since December.\n\nThe next two days will determine success or failure, so traders will spend their days trading both sides of the market for the rest of the week to see how this first test of 2017 plays out.\n\nToday's three big stock charts looks at the price musings of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS ), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN ) as three stocks that are facing similarly critical tests of their technical standings.\n\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS)\n\nThe logistics/delivery company has been locked in a trading range since its disappointing earnings report dropped the shares by more than 10%. Now, after several tests of what has turned into critical chart support, UPS shares are testing $104 for support again.\n\nThe level ($104) can be tracked back to April and May of 2016 as a significant support level, which is why the traders are keying some buying off it now.\n\nThe touch of $104 comes while UPS shares are touching down on oversold readings from the stock's RSI. This indicates that the flow of selling pressure is likely to ebb and fewer buyers will be needed to change the momentum for the short-term.\n\nA break below $104 will target another 4% to 5% decline in the shares as $100 is the next clear line of support. According to our model, the stock remains in the short- and intermediate-term bearish category given the technical breakdowns and the declining 50-day moving average.\n\nAlphabet Inc (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet shares have snapped lower over the last week and now reside in a technical \"rock and hard place\" situation.\n\nGOOGL stock sold out of an overbought situation as it hit $875 right through its first level of support drawn by its 50-day moving average at $843. Friday and Monday's additional selling pressure dropped Alphabet stock to test its 100-day moving average at $825. This is the second time that GOOGL shares have fallen against this trendline for support in as many months.\n\nTraders need to keep an eye on the trend of the 50-day moving average on Alphabet stock as it appears to be transitioning from a bullish ascending pattern to a neutral and potentially bearish declining trend. This will have a negative implication on the price target for GOOGL shares over the short-term outlook.\n\nFor now, maintain an eye on $820, which represents the stock's 100-day moving average. A break below this will see Alphabet move into that short-term bearish pattern with an initial price target of $800.\n\nAmgen, Inc. (AMGN)\n\nAmgen shares continue to recover from the news that their newest cholesterol drug, Repatha, didn't trial as well as expected. AMGN stock has shed about 12% since that news took shares downs.\n\nIt appears that much of the selling has been squeezed out of the market as the stock is landing close to technical support levels that should help to build a case for short-term bulls.\n\nFirst, Amgen shares entered an oversold position last week on the decline below $170. This called for a likely short-term bounce, which has yet to be seen.\n\nSecond, while AMGN shares could slice through their 50-day moving averages, the stock still has two important technical lifelines.\n\nThe 200-day moving average for Amgen shares is trading at $161 indicating potential support. This same price level has seen significant price support and resistance over the last six months, strengthening the argument that we will see buyers enter the market at this price.\n\nFinally, AMGN's 100-day moving average, which just transitioned into a bullish pattern itself, is bringing support at $157 in case Amgen can crack through $161.\n\nBottom line for technical traders is that the headline effect of Repatha is likely wearing off and the technicals, which remains bullish, should bring AMGN stock back into its intermediate-term bullish climb.\n\nAs of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post 3 Big Stock Charts for Tuesday: Alphabet Inc (GOOGL), Amgen, Inc.

With a little help from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and others though, Facebook is now positioned to take a bigger bite out of that pie.\n\nFacebook Rolls Out Header Bidding\n\nIt's not a description that does the idea justice, but it does set the stage - header bidding is a way a website operator, or \"publisher,\" can pick the display ad that pays the most for appearing on a particular web page.\n\nIn the web's early days, it wasn't always clear to an advertiser if the ad space they were buying was worth it.\n\nLikewise, it wasn't clear to a publisher if the ad space they were selling was the best price they could achieve. But, in that the communication of such information was poor, both parties relied on the middleman (usually Google) to do the best it could do, and keep a few pennies per impression for itself.\n\nA lot has changed since the dawn of display ads, though. Namely, not unlike a stock exchange, a buyer and seller of web ads can now see the market's best bid and offer.\n\nIt's not exactly a new idea. Facebook announced it was developing this so-called Facebook Audience in August of last year. That was a soft launch though, and didn't include all of its possible partners that will provide the underlying technology. It wasn't until this week the product officially launched, with Amazon.com's header-bidding platform being one of six ad networks participating , all competing for business.\n\nGoogle Beware\n\nWhile FB stock owners have good reason to be excited, Google is still Google, and is a force to be reckoned with. It won't go down easy.\n\nAnd yet, thus far it has not developed a weapon that it can effectively fend off the growing tide of header bidding. Its best response has been what it calls Dynamic Allocation … a sort of hybrid of header bidding and its traditional ad-sales approach. Advertisers aren't impressed, however, saying it only benefits Alphabet.\n\nSortable's Chris Reid opined last year that the advent of header bidding could drive Google's display ad market share from 90% to something between 40% and 50%. Conversely, publishers participating in the early dry runs of its Audience Network program saw revenue grow between 10% and 30% .\n\nWith those metrics on the table, something explained last year in the wake of the soft launch of Facebook's header bidding plans was very much on target:\n\n\"Google is frankly very defensive because their position is being threatened. If you now amplify that by Facebook saying, 'Hey, wait a second, look, there's a chink in the armor. All these independent companies have found it, why don't we do the same thing and bring our wallet to bear?' We're actually going to start to see an event that could at a very, very substantial level check the Google monopoly.\"\n\nFurther threatening Google is the fact that Amazon and Facebook may be better equipped to build a profile of a particular user than Google is, delivering more targeted ads from one device to the next. In other words, based on a user's PC history, the network can deliver a specific ad to that user on his or her mobile device.\n\nGoogle's user profiles allow for highly targeted ads as well, though that aging approach may not be as refined and updated as the one offered by Audience Network.\n\nBottom Line for FB Stock\n\nThe ultimate impact the new version of Audience Network may have on the profitability of FB stock isn't perfectly clear. There is clearly an upside though, with little to no downside.\n\nTo the extent guesses are being made though, observers are apt to be underestimating the benefit the new scheme will have. Google's size and disinterest in being competitive have given rise to the new competition Facebook is now supporting. Advertisers are already trying that \"something else\" besides Google, and liking the switch.\n\nAs of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Owners, Put This on Your Radar appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Chinese internet search leader Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU) has made a name for itself as one of the leaders in artificial intelligence (AI) in the world's most populous country. It has made no secret about its excitement regarding the prospects for the technology and has hired some of the foremost experts in the field for high level positions within the company. Now, it is getting the Chinese government seal of approval for its trouble.\n\nThe government agency in China responsible for planning economic and social strategies will provide an undisclosed amount of funding to Baidu to develop a national laboratory committed to deep learning, a specific discipline of AI. The \"lab\" will not be a physical structure, but an online network of interconnected researchers sharing data. Baidu will be joined by Tsinghua and Beihang Universities and other academics from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The lab's initial focus will be in the areas of computer vision, biometric identification, and human-computer interaction.\n\nAI will transform industry after industry. Image source: Pixabay.\n\nAI is the new electricity\n\nBaidu's CEO, Robin Li has been outspoken regarding his belief regarding the potential of AI . At the Baidu World Conference in 2016, he stated \"gone is the era of PC, and soon will we say goodbye to the era of mobile internet...We believe that coming is the era of artificial intelligence, which to us is the Baidu Brain.\"\n\nThe Baidu Brain is an AI-based artificial neural network that sorts through reams of data and can detect patterns. Baidu's chief scientist Andrew Ng was a founding member of the team that developed the Google Brain prior to his tenure at Baidu. He is also an adjunct professor at Stanford University, where he taught AI and has made similar statements concerning his belief that AI will be transformational:\n\nI think that AI is a new superpower. AI is the new electricity. Two hundred years ago there was no such thing as electricity. You couldn't talk on phones, there was no electric lighting, you couldn't have a refrigerator. About 100 years ago as we started to build out electricity we saw that transformed not just one industry but industry after industry. We think that AI will similarly transform industry to industry. In that sense it is a superpower.\n\nThis neural network and others like it have led to far-reaching developments in image recognition, natural language processing, voice recognition, and user profiling. These in turn have led to the development of virtual assistants that reside on most smartphones, smart home speaker systems , advances in medical research , and even tools for cybersecurity .\n\nWhite House issues report on AI. Image source: Pixabay.\n\nGovernments worldwide waking up to the potential of AI\n\nChina isn't the only country considering the future of AI. A White House report issued in late December titled Artificial Intelligence, Automation, and the Economy that sought to determine the \"ways that artificial intelligence will transform our economy over the coming years and decades.\" The initial report , Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence , revealed that the US government was spending $1.2 billion on AI research last year and recommended tripling that amount.\n\nLast year, DeepMind, a division of Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google revealed that its AlphaGo AI system defeated South Korea's top ranked player at Go, an ancient Chinese game whose complexity had stymied previous computer attempts to master. South Korea subsequently announced a plan to invest $863 million in AI research over the coming five years. The UK has also announced its intention to invest 20 million pounds in the areas of robotics and AI.\n\nFoolish final thoughts\n\nThis may be the beginning of a new era of government backing for AI. Boston Consulting Group estimates that AI will generate between $100 billion and $120 billion in productivity gains by 2025. Just as big tech companies are racing to stake their claim in this transformational science, so are governments afraid of being left behind.\n\nThe bump from the Chinese government couldn't come at a better time for Baidu -- the company has been struggling to re-energize its slowing growth and has been counting on AI to provide the catalyst. Online marketing, which represents more than 91% of the company's revenue, has fallen 8.2% and 6.7% year-over-year respectively, in its two most recent quarters, and the customers base that produces that revenue have fallen 18.6% and 15.9%. In the last year, the company has spent 14% of its total revenue on research and development expenses, and the majority of that has been on AI.\n\nThe company is banking on AI to reverse course, and now it has some extra backing to do so.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Baidu\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Women comprise 36 percent of Uber's workforce, and almost half of its employees identify as white. For context, Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported that female employees accounted for 32 percent of its total, and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) subsidiary Google noted that females made up 31 percent of its overall workforce in 2015. Google stated that 59 percent of its employees were white, while a reported 56 percent of Apple employees were white in 2015. Approximately 31 percent of Uber's employees were Asian, and 8.8 percent identified themselves as black. Of Uber's total workforce, Hispanic and multi-racial employees comprised 5.6 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. (See also: The Best (and Worst) Companies for Workplace Diversity.)\n\nHowever, minorities are underrepresented in leadership roles at Uber.

They range from charges of sexism to its CEO Travis Kalanick's frank admission that he needed leadership help after a video surfaced of him arguing with an Uber driver. (See also: Uber to Change Culture and Present Diversity Report.)\n\nAccording to Hornsey, transparency about its culture will help the company build trust. In a statement accompanying the report, Kalanick reinforced that message. \"I know that we have been too slow in publishing our numbers – and that the best way to demonstrate our commitment to change is through transparency. And to make progress, it's important we measure what matters,\" he stated. Uber also pledged $3 million Tuesday to support groups that encourage minorities in tech.

Chinese Android users have access to a slew of alternative app stores built by internet companies like Baidu and Tencent as well as smartphone manufacturers like Huawei and Xiaomi.\n\nThird party Android app stores are expected to garner about $36 billion in user spending by 2021 compared to the $10 billion seen in 2016, according to the app analytics firm. Reported by CNBC, App Annie Senior Vice President of research Danielle Levitas said China’s position as the “biggest smartphone channel” isn’t going away even if smartphone sales slow.\n\nThe app analytics firm expects user spending through all Android app stores to come in at about $41 billion this year compared to the $27 billion user spending across all Android app stores in 2016. Apple’s app store, on the other hand, is expected to see user spending of $40 billion this year versus roughly $27 billion in 2016.\n\nApp Annie looks at information from key publishers, discussions with stakeholders, past performance as well as economic situations to issue its forecasts.\n\nThis report comes a few days after technology news website VentureBeat reported that a new free \"app of the week\" section had been added to Google Play.

Oracle’s capex rose 48% to ~$1.5 billion in fiscal 2017.\n\nOracle has targeted the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East, and North America to open more data centers in 2018. Sharing the company’s viewpoint on increased capex, Deepak Patil, vice president of development at Oracle Cloud Platform, said, “This regional expansion underscores our commitment to making the engineering and capital investments required to continue to be a global large scale cloud platform leader.”\n\nInvestment in R&D gives technology players an edge among peers\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s proposal to reduce the income tax rate could lead to cash repatriation to the US. Technology companies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle, IBM (IBM), and Salesforce (CRM) have significant cash levels parked overseas. This proposal could give them the flexibility to fund growth by investing in R&D (research and development) while adhering to their usual policies of returning cash to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Spending on R&D can drive success in innovation and breakthrough technologies.\n\nAs a result, leading technology companies, which are also dominant players in the cloud space, are among the top 20 biggest spenders on innovation. The list included Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Intel (INTC), Microsoft, Apple (AAPL), Cisco Systems (CSCO), and Oracle, according to a recent study by Strategy & Global Innovation 1000.\n\nAs cloud adoption increases, customers are demanding more command over their networks, data protection, and security infrastructure. They are likely to choose cloud platforms that give them the most flexibility. As a result, these software companies are aiming to direct the majority of their R&D spending toward the design, deployment, and maintenance of their enterprise cloud security models.", "Inside AT&T's Proposed Acquisition of Time Warner PART 5 OF 11\n\nTWX’s Turner Segment Could See Significant Transformation in 2017\n\nTime Warner’s expectations regarding distribution of content\n\nIn 2017, Time Warner (TWX) expects the subscription revenues in its Turner business division to see double-digit growth as a result of the renewal of its affiliate fee agreements.\n\nTime Warner stated at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet and Telecom Conference in early March 2017 that it expects the trend of skinny bundles to pick up.

In fiscal 3Q17, the gross margin for SaaS and PaaS stood at 65%, compared to 51% in fiscal 3Q16.\n\nOracle continues to focus on SaaS and PaaS. In fiscal 3Q17, its operating expenses in cloud SaaS and PaaS rose 25%, and company allocated $1.5 billion to R&D (research and development).\n\nOracle is hopeful regarding expansion in its margins as the Saas and PaaS revenues’ contribution to overall revenues increases. Safra Catz, co-CEO of Oracle, stated, “I expect that our total Saas and PaaS gross margin will continue to trend toward 80% over time.”", "Republicans are poised to overturn strict broadband privacy rules introduced under the Obama administration, representing a massive boost to internet service providers that rely on monitoring customer browsing patterns for advertising purposes.\n\nThe House of Representatives voted 215-205 to revoke the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) broadband privacy rules, which required telecom and cable providers such as Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ) to ask customers for permission before selling information, including health and financial data, to advertisers. Last week, the Senate voted to revoke the rules. The White House has said President Trump strongly supports the repeal.\n\nThe regulations, introduced at the end of Barack Obama’s second presidential term, attracted strong criticism from Republicans, who argued that they created an unfair playing field in the digital advertising market. (See also: New FCC Rules to Protect Privacy.)\n\nUnfair Playing Field\n\nRepublicans campaigned to banish the FCC’s privacy laws, which they said are too strict and present an unfair advantage to internet companies such as Facebook (FB) and Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOG). Internet companies are immune from the rules because they are governed by the Federal Trade Commission, a different agency.\n\nCongressional action to overturn the FCC’s regulations was welcomed by the Internet and Television Association, whose members include the nation’s largest cable companies. In a statement, the trade body described the repeal as \"an important step toward restoring consumer privacy protections that apply consistently.\"\n\nDemocrats and consumer groups have fought hard to protect broadband user rights, claiming that service providers should not be able to freely view how their customers browse the web.

's ( MSFT ) valuation has gone up by more than 20% in the last 12 months and the stock price is constantly near 52-week highs. There are several factors behind the new-found momentum of Microsoft stock , including reduced dependency on Windows revenue streams, a surging software-as-a-service portfolio and near triple-digit growth of the company's infrastructure-as-a-service offering, Microsoft Azure.\n\nOne major development in the last six months is the technology giant has decided to put all of its muscle behind its SaaS products, Office 365 and Dynamics 365. Microsoft is in an extremely strong position in the office collaboration market. The company recently announced there are 85 million monthly active Office 365 users around the world. The commercial monthly subscription cost per Office 365 user starts at $5 and goes above $30 for enterprise users, suggesting Microsoft is easily making more than half a billion dollars every month.\n\nThe important point to note here is Office commercial revenues have been growing above 50% for the past several quarters, with last quarter numbers coming in at 47%. If there was enough competition in the market, such high growth would not be easy to come by; and when you factor in the near 45% margin from by its Productivity and Business Processes segment, it is clear Microsoft has an above-average product with negligible market competition.\n\nAlphabet Inc. 's ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) Google introduced several improvements to its productivity suite, known as G Suite, during the recent Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco. Amazon ( AMZN ) is slowly stepping into the business productivity segment as well, recently having launched Amazon Chime, a Skype competitor.\n\nThe competition is slowly getting there, but the problem with productivity applications is users do not like moving to a new application after getting used to the existing one that is already working well for them. In addition, moving an entire company to new productivity tools is a disruptive experience, to say the least.\n\nAlthough the objective of all collaboration software is essentially the same, products from different companies will have different features and functions. A global team that is familiar with Office 365 would find it extremely difficult to move to a competitor's product because the learning curve will be steep, and let's not forget the cost and difficulty involved in migrating to the new application suite.\n\nWith a base of 85 million users (more than one-fourth the size of Twitter 's (NYSE: TWTR ) user base), Office 365 is possibly one of the most-used commercial SaaS applications in the world, and it is growing fast. Similar to the lead Amazon has in cloud service, the advantage Microsoft has over competitors in regard to Office 365 will make it extremely hard to compete with.\n\nThe fact Microsoft has managed to draw attention away from its Windows licensing revenues to its newer cloud-based revenues alone is proof the company has transitioned nicely into the new growth segment.\n\nThe company will still face some cannibalization of revenues - because every new Office 365 customer is one customer lost to its standalone Office application - but the beauty of getting users to subscribe to SaaS applications is Microsoft will now be able to keep adding new functions and services on a regular basis, expanding its portfolio and revenues.\n\nDisclosure: I have no positions in the stock mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.\n\nStart afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nScore one for civil liberties. This week, social networking giant Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) overhauled its privacy policies, blocking police departments from using the site as a means of keeping tabs on users who may also be associated with violent protesting.\n\nOn the surface, it may seem irrelevant to the current and future value of Facebook stock. Most members of the ad-driven platform know they're of no interest to law enforcement officials, and the protestors that were making themselves known on the social media site likely didn't know they were being watched (and therefore didn't alter the way and frequency with which they used the website).\n\nIn other words, so what ?\n\nThing is, it's more than conceivable there were enough users of the Facebook platform that had been steering clear due to privacy concerns - just on principle - to expect them to log on now that their privacy is being protected.\n\nPrivacy Remains Contentious Topic\n\nIt's neither a new debate, nor is it a minor one.\n\nSo, in the grand scheme of things, it's not difficult to believe that Facebook was looking the other way when it knew law enforcement officials were using its platform as a new tool in the war on crime.\n\nThe question Facebook stock holders should be asking: At what point does accommodating every policy and agency request make the website too alarming for even the average user to visit?\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union asked the question, and then answered it in a way that put Facebook in a questionable light . The company responded with a change in its policy.\n\nNew Policies Curtail Pinpointing\n\nAs of Monday, police and other law enforcement agencies can no longer tap Geofeedia's data , which was built to pinpoint where Facebook users are - Facebook completely cut off Geofeedia's access to the site. It's not necessarily a permanent hurdle, but it is one that will remain in place indefinitely on the location-based analytics platform.\n\nFacebook's deputy chief privacy officer Rob Sherman commented: \"Our goal is to make our policy explicit.\"\n\nNew Page\n\nThe clarified policy does not preclude FB from assisting law enforcement officials on a case-by-case basis. Indeed, the company says it still intends to assist police when appropriate. Presumably, this would mean instances where a search warrant has been issued, which requires a reasonable suspicion that retrieving such information would help lead to a successful prosecution.\n\nTwitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) and Facebook unit Instagram also booted Geofeedia from using their websites to gather and sell user information following the ACLU's exposure of the organization's invasive tactics.\n\nBottom Line for Facebook Stock\n\nOn the surface it seems like a potential setback for Facebook, and by extension for Facebook stock. One of the most compelling features of the social media platform to advertisers was the deep, broad, and well-defined data the company could collect about each and every user.\n\nIf it's scaling that detail back - and presumably it's doing so to more developers than just Geofeedia - then the potential value to advertisers is crimped.\n\nDon't overthink it, though, and don't assume there's a cut-and-dried if/then relationship between how invasive a website can be and how valuable detailed user data is to an advertiser. They say they want stratification, but many advertisers are content to promote their product or service to any reasonably targeted consumer.\n\nOn the other hand, consumers are more apt to use caution when it comes to websites that may nefariously collect data on a consumer, even without their consent or knowledge. People have a decent sixth sense when it comes to being unreasonably monitored.\n\nIn other words, a FB that's more interested in basic civil rights is a better investment than one that's not. The trade-off is more than palatable.\n\nAs of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Privacy Revamp Makes Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Even More Attractive appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Marketers will continue to shift a larger percentage of their ad budgets to digital in 2017. U.S. digital ad spending is expected to reach $83 billion this year, up 16% according to eMarketer .\n\nBy far, the two biggest digital advertisers are Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . The two will combine to take 57% of the market this year. That's up from 54% last year as the two combine to take about 74% of all the growth in U.S. ad spend.\n\nEven with the recent introduction of ads on the extremely popular Snapchat from Snap (NYSE: SNAP) and continued pressure from Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , the two giants continue to completely dominate the competition.\n\nImage source: Google.\n\nGoogle search takes $0.78 of every dollar\n\nGoogle's biggest business, search, is also its biggest growth driver. Google's search ad revenue is expected to climb 16% this year compared to its overall revenue growth of 15%. eMarketer expects Google to take 78% of all U.S. search ad spend as it takes share from Microsoft and other smaller competitors. The search giant will bring in about $28.6 billion from search ads this year, according to the research group.\n\nGoogle's growth stems largely from mobile. Android is the most popular mobile operating system in the U.S., and Google is the default search engine on iOS, the second most popular mobile operating system. Microsoft's efforts to penetrate the mobile market largely fell flat, although it is the search engine behind Siri on iOS.\n\nAmericans use Google for about 94% of their searches on mobile. As mobile continues to account for more and more of our time, Google's lead in search will only grow wider.\n\nFacebook dominates display advertising\n\nWhile Google grows more dominant in search, Facebook is increasingly dominant in display ads. eMarketer expects Facebook's U.S. advertising to grow 32.1% to $16.33 billion this year. Google is its next closest competitor, and it's expected to generate just $5.24 billion from display ads.\n\nImage source: Facebook.\n\neMarketer's projection for U.S. ad revenue growth is actually below analysts' consensus estimate for Facebook's overall revenue growth this year. It's worth noting the U.S. is historically Facebook's largest and one of the faster-growing regions in terms of revenue. However, saturation in ad load could cause U.S. ad growth to slow more significantly compared to regions where Facebook has faster user growth.\n\nInstagram will make a significant contribution to Facebook's U.S. ad revenue this year, growing to account for about 20% of Facebook's total on mobile, up from 15% last year. Mobile accounted for 84% of Facebook's total ad revenue last quarter.\n\nThe competition can't touch Facebook or Google\n\nOne of Facebook and Google's biggest competitors in display advertising, Twitter, is expected to see its mobile ad revenue decline for the first time in its history. Its revenue on mobile devices will fall about 5% to $1.15 billion, according to eMarketer. Mobile accounted for 89% of Twitter's total ad revenue in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe expected to decline comes after management provided anemic first-quarter guidance and followed it up by de-emphasizing certain ad products . Twitter is shifting its focus to its most profitable products in order to make good on its effort to become profitable this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Snapchat is a growing force in video ads. Indeed, eMarketer expects the company's U.S. ad revenue to grow 158% to $770 million. Even with its robust growth, Snap's app revenue still only accounts for 1.2% of the total U.S. mobile ad market, and just 4% of the total growth in U.S. digital advertising.\n\nEven with strong competition, Facebook and Google continue to dominate the market as users flock to their services. The trends favor both to continue growing faster than the rest of the industry for the foreseeable future, too.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Facebook\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Snap made its public debut at $17, surged to nearly $30 on the first day, then tumbled back to just over $20 in less than two weeks.\n\nWhy did investors seemingly snub Snap, which some bulls have hailed as the \"next Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) \"? The answer is simple -- six red flags indicate that the stock could slide much lower before it's considered a bargain.\n\nSnap's Android app. Image source: Google Play.\n\n1. Slowing user growth\n\nThe decline of Twitter 's (NYSE: TWTR ) stock taught us that social networks live and die by their active user growth. Without active user growth, advertisers start skipping the platform in favor of faster growing ones. Snapchat's daily active users (DAUs) rose just 3% sequentially to 158 million last quarter, compared to 7% growth in the third quarter and 17% growth in the second quarter.\n\nThat slowdown was likely caused by the launch of new Snapchat-like features for Facebook's Instagram and Messenger apps -- which include Instagram Stories, vanishing Instagram photos, Instant Video for Messenger, and a Messenger Day app which deletes photos and videos after 24 hours. Instagram Stories, in particular, grew its DAUs from 100 million to 150 million between last October and this January.\n\n2. Its cash burn rate\n\nSnap's S-1 filing revealed that it finished fiscal 2016 with just $150.1 million in cash and equivalents -- a 77% decline from $640.8 million at the end of 2015. The company had a negative operating cash flow of $188 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and it burned through $1.14 in cash for each dollar in generated revenue.\n\nSnap will retain $2.3 billion of the $3.2 billion it raised during its IPO. That amount will help Snap tread water for a while, but it might not last long if its cash burn rate accelerates. Susquehanna analysts believe that Snap won't achieve positive free cash flow until fiscal 2020. However, that estimate could be far too optimistic if rivals like Instagram Stories continue throttling Snapchat's growth.\n\n3. Widening losses\n\nSnap's revenue surged 590% to $404.5 million in 2016. But on the bottom line, its net loss widened from $372.9 million to $514.6 million. The company's biggest expenses include multi-billion dollar cloud contracts with Alphabet 's Google and Amazon .\n\nIf Snap can't narrow its losses with such massive revenue growth, things could get very ugly once its top line growth slows down. Snap has also warned in its SEC filing that it \"may never achieve or maintain profitability.\"\n\n4. Unrealistic revenue growth targets\n\nSnap claims that it can generate $500 million to $1 billion in revenues in 2017. That's a very wide range, but analysts are modeling their forecasts on the high-end, with an average estimate of $1.04 billion. However, it's unclear how Snap plans to hit that target.\n\nThe three types of Snap ads. Image source: Snap.\n\n96% of Snap's revenue came from advertising in 2016. Snap's ad products include full-screen video ads, sponsored geofilters, and sponsored lenses. If Snap's user growth peaks, it could possibly boost its number of marketing partners to generate higher ad revenues per customer. But more than doubling its 2016 revenues to $1 billion in 2017 seems like a huge stretch.\n\nResearch firm eMarketer recently trimmed its 2017 ad revenue forecast for Snapchat from $800 million to $770 million. That reduction was modest, but it indicates that analysts aren't certain that it can hit its ambitious growth targets.\n\n5. It thinks it's a \"camera company\"\n\nCo-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel has repeatedly declared that Snap is different from other social networks because it's a \"camera company.\" Tthat statement sounded reasonable because it produced special filters and lenses for smartphone cameras, but rivals like Instagram can easily make similar claims.\n\nSnap's Spectacles. Image source: Snap.\n\nSpiegel didn't say that Snap would sell physical cameras anytime soon, but the company launched its Spectacles Snap-capturing glasses late last year. The devices attracted lots of shoppers, thanks to a clever marketing campaign featuring vanishing vending machines .\n\nIf Snap builds upon that idea, it could start selling other cheap image capture devices to build its brand and differentiate itself from Instagram. However, that move could cause it to burn through its cash even faster and weigh down its bottom line with a low-margin hardware business.\n\nShould you avoid Snap?\n\nSnap looks like a company that went public before it formed a coherent roadmap toward positive cash flows and profitability. Without the ability to reach those goals, Snap remains an incredibly overvalued stock at nearly 60 times sales.\n\nTo put that into perspective, Facebook had a P/S ratio of about 10 at the close of its first trading day. Twitter ended its first day with a P/S ratio of about 11. This means that Snap could easily plummet to the single digits if investors realize that this ephemeral emperor has no clothes.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) are companies that have become known for their large and growing cloud computing businesses. We don't think of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA ) that way. But according to a new report , the Chinese e-commerce giant could make the biggest cloud-induced leap in the coming years, which could be a major catalyst for Alibaba stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe report by Morgan Stanley said that BABA stock could gain the most market share in the increasingly crowded cloud-computing market in the coming years.\n\nThe bank expects Alibaba's cloud revenue from its AliCloud platform to reach $10 billion by 2021, 10 times the $1 billion it sold last year. For perspective, that was 6.3% of the company's total sales last year. In five years, AliCloud is expected to comprise 18% of BABA's total sales.\n\nAliCloud Is a Big Part of Alibaba Stock's Potential\n\nWith the company's sales slowing the last few years - from 215% growth in 2012 to 56% growth in 2014 to 29% last year - an extra $9 billion tacked on to its top line over the next five years would be a game changer. It's just a report, and it's based largely on Morgan Stanley's theory that the cloud \"is a transformational technology like electricity,\" and that its usage should broaden in the coming years. If that's the case, then cloud stocks like BABA stock are \"widely undervalued today,\" the report said.\n\nSo, add that to the long list of catalysts for a stock that's already up 38% in the last year, including a 20% run-up since late December. Alibaba stock took a hit in 2015 when the Chinese stock market went belly up, falling as low as $57 in September of that year. In the 18 months since, it has nearly doubled.\n\nMeanwhile, sales and earnings are projected to perk up again this year: Analysts anticipate 54% top-line growth, which would be the highest in three years, and 43% earnings-per-share growth. And those numbers don't include much help from AliCloud, which is actually expected to decrease (to 4%) as a percentage of sales this year before really taking flight starting in 2018.\n\nGiven its dominance in China's e-commerce market - it's essentially the Chinese Amazon, right down to a recent acquisition of a major online video-streaming entity - Alibaba stock was already a strong long-term investment candidate for any portfolio. Now that BABA, like Amazon before it, is transforming into something much more than an online marketplace, it could be just scratching the surface of its immense potential. The AliCloud will be a huge part of that transformation.\n\nBABA Is AMZN … 15 Years Ago\n\nFifteen years ago, AMZN was merely a place where people could go online and buy books, CDs and electronics. Then it launched Amazon Web Services in 2002, and the stock took off, tripling within a year. In 2010, the company starting producing original content for online streaming; AMZN stock has risen nearly 8-fold since.\n\nPut simply: Alibaba is where Amazon was 15 years ago. Thus, I think BABA stock is in the very early innings of a sustained, multi-decade rally. Buy it now and thank me in 15 years.\n\nAs of this writing, Chris Fraley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post The Jump in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Is Just Beginning appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "There's no doubt about it: We're right smack in the middle of a bull market. The S&P 500 is up about 70% over the past five years and about 18% in the past 12 months alone. While this is great for investors who already own stocks, it means it's more difficult for investors to find attractive stocks to buy today.\n\nBut rest assured there are still some solid long-term bets. Here are three that stand out even in this raging bull market: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Yum! Brands (NYSE: YUM) , and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) . Even after rising about 17%, 14%, and 19%, respectively, in the past 12 months, each of these stocks still looks attractive today.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet\n\nWhile Alphabet, parent company of Google, is a pure technology stock, investors shouldn't automatically assume it's just another risky tech stock. On the contrary, Alphabet's leadership in search has carved out a wide economic moat for the company.\n\nAlphabet's Google advertising business, which comprises about 86% of Alphabet's total revenue, is driven by the company's powerful search business. Helping Google's advertising revenue increase 17% year over year, Alphabet's search business not only remains dominant, but its lead over competition even seems to be increasing. Research company eMarketer recently forecasted Alphabet's share of U.S. search advertising will increase from 75.8% to 80% in 2018, thanks to the company's timely and aggressive investments in mobile search.\n\nWith a price-to-earnings ratio of about 30, Alphabet isn't cheap. But a wide economic moat and persistent strong growth make this stock worth owning.\n\nYum! Brands\n\nYum! Brands offers investors a way to buy into a collection of some of the most well-known food franchises on the planet: KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. With these highly scalable quick-service restaurants under its ownership, Yum! Brands is well positioned to not only grow, but also to pay investors a solid dividend while it's at it; management expects annualized growth in system sales and operating profit of about 7% in constant currency, and the stock currently offers a dividend yield of about 1.9%.\n\nWith a price-to-earnings ratio of about 26, Yum! Brands certainly isn't trading at a deep discount. But its sustainable business model and management's expectations for robust system sales make this stock look tasty.\n\nWells Fargo\n\nAs the biggest bank in the U.S. measured by deposits, Wells Fargo is a bet on a bank with significant scale. Add in Wells Fargo's emphasis of enduring customer relationships, operational excellence, and conservative risk management, Wells Fargo is nearly in a class of its own.\n\nWhile the bank's sales culture created some ethical problems for the company recently, it's worth noting that even famed investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway hasn't sold a single share of the bank amid the high-profile headlines -- a notable move considering Wells Fargo is Berkshire's biggest holding, valued at about $30 billion.\n\nWhile Wells Fargo is up sharply recently, its attractiveness is highlighted by its 2.6% dividend yield and its conservative price-to-book ratio of 1.7 (which is still well below pre-recession levels). Further, the stock still trades at a fairly conservative price-to-earnings ratio of about 15.\n\nIn a bull market like this, a pullback in the overall stock market is certainly possible -- and these three stocks could very well suffer along with the market if this happens. But these are the sort of stocks that have a good chance of performing solidly on a five-year time horizon even if they are purchased at today's prices.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

( FB ), Google and Twitter Inc. ( TWTR ), it has given them one month to come up with detailed plans on how they would comply with EU regulations. If final proposals are not satisfactory, consumer authorities could ultimately resort to enforcement action.\n\nThe European union consumer authorities and organisations have received a growing number of complaints from consumers, who have been targeted by fraud or scams when using social media websites, as well as having been subject to certain terms of services that do not respect EU consumer law, the EU said.\n\nOn this basis, EU consumer authorities, under the leadership of the French consumer authority and with the support of the European Commission, sent a letter to Facebook, Twitter and Google+ last November asking them to address two areas of concern.\n\nCommissioner JourovÃ¡ said,\".... Social media companies also need to take more responsibility in addressing scams and fraud happening on their platforms. I want to thank the EU consumer authorities who have worked tirelessly with the Commission on this important issue over the past months. From today, social media companies have one month to come up with solutions to comply with EU rules.\"\n\nThe companies have agreed to propose changes on two areas: Unfair terms and conditions; addressing fraud and scams that mislead consumers when using the social networks.\n\nThe EU noted that the Social media companies must remove any fraud and scams appearing on their websites that could mislead consumers, once they become aware of such practices. In this connection, national consumer protection authorities should have a direct and standardised communication channel to signal such wrongdoings to social media operators and obtain take down of content, as well as information concerning the traders responsible for the infringements. This is in line with EU consumer legislation and the E-Commerce Directive, which gives the possibility to Member States to establish procedures governing the removal or disabling of access to illegal information.\n\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\n\nhttp://www.rttnews.com", "Analysts haven't been kind to Snap (NYSE: SNAP) since it made its IPO. Not one analyst has given Snap stock a buy rating, and shares have fallen considerably from its opening price at the beginning of the month.\n\nMost recently, market researcher eMarketer lowered its expectations for Snap's U.S. ad revenue from $800 million to $770 million. The reason behind the lower estimate is \"higher-than-estimated revenue sharing with partners.\"\n\nSnapchat offers revenue sharing as an incentive for content publishers to use its Publisher Stories (formerly Discover) format. Snap is also partnering with various media companies to produce original shows, which may provide even more favorable revenue share for the content producer.\n\nLet's take a look at how revenue sharing affects Snap's financials.\n\nImage source: Snap/Author.\n\nRevenue sharing doesn't impact Snap's top line\n\nWhile eMarketer is lowering its expectations for Snapchat, the actual decline in net ad revenue won't show up in Snap's top line. Snap reports gross revenue similarly to how Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) reports Google's revenue. Google lumps in revenue from its network partners with its search and YouTube revenue, and then accounts for revenue sharing as part of its traffic acquisition costs.\n\nThe amount of revenue Snap shares with its publisher partners is then reported as an item in the company's cost of revenue. So, eMarketer may have well said it expects Snap's cost of revenue to come in $30 million higher than originally anticipated.\n\nSnap's Publisher Stories. Image source: Snap.\n\nLast year, Snap says revenue sharing payments increased $48.2 million from 2015, but it doesn't provide a specific amount it paid to partners. That does at least provide a floor, and it's nearly 12% of Snap's $404.5 million in total revenue last year.\n\nFor comparison, Google paid out $10.9 billion in revenue sharing to its network partners (not including YouTube) in 2016. That's almost 14% of its total ad revenue for the year.\n\nRevenue sharing may increase even faster\n\nWhile most analysts expect Snap to grow its top line to around $1 billion this year, its path to that mark may mean less of that revenue makes it past the second line (cost of revenue) on its income statement. Snap has inked several high-profile deals with media companies over the last year.\n\nIt already has deals in place with NBC, ABC, BBC, Turner, New York Time, Discovery, Time, A+E Networks, and VICE to produce original shows for Snapchat. Snap is still actively pursuing these high-profile deals.\n\nIt's important to note that Snap says its revenue-sharing arrangements \"generally do not contain minimum financial commitments to our publisher partners and are generally not tied to specific events or promotions.\" That seems to indicate Snap doesn't pay anything up front for these productions, but Snap may help out with the costs as \"content creation costs\" also show up in management's description of cost of revenue. Content creation costs include personnel-related costs, according to Snap's S-1.\n\nWith the growth of the Publisher Stories platform, investors should expect a stark increase in cost of goods sold due to revenue-sharing and content-creation costs.\n\nCost of revenue is already under scrutiny\n\nSnap posted a negative gross margin last year as its cost of revenue overshadowed its revenue. The biggest factor behind it is Snap's hosting expenses, for which it primarily relies on Google Cloud. It's already committed to spending $3 billion in total on cloud infrastructure over the next five years, which will continue to put pressure on Snap's gross margin as it tries to scale.\n\nAdd to that the fact that one of its revenue drivers is growing content from publisher partners, which contributes to even more cost of revenue. While a few tens of millions of dollars is relatively small compared to the hundreds of millions Snap is spending with its cloud partners each year, Snap's margins are so thin that every dollar counts.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

They compete head-to-head in what many expect to emerge as an increasingly important area of consumer tech in coming years. They're social-media powerhouse Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and messaging platform Line Corporation (NYSE: LN) .\n\nLine made its public debut last July, so the sample size of its trading history is minuscule. However, in the months since its IPO, the respective fortunes of Line and Facebook have diverged to a meaningful degree.\n\nLN data by YCharts\n\nOf course, this only tells any investor a fraction of what he or she needs to know. Let's examine three important aspects of Facebook's and Line's investment narratives, to figure out which stock is the better buy today.\n\nFinancial fortitude\n\nThe comparison of financial might between Line and Facebook is an instance of David versus Goliath. Look at these four important measures of solvency and liquidity for both companies:\n\nCompany Cash and Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio Facebook $29.4 billion $0 $16.1 billion 11.9 Line Corp $1.2 billion $0 $253.4 billion 2.0\n\nData sources: Facebook and Line Corp. investor relations, Yahoo! Finance.\n\nFacebook wins each category by a landslide, but Line is in fine financial shape. It has no debt, has over $1 billion in the bank, and produces plenty of spare cash each year. However, the winner here was inevitable.\n\nWinner: Facebook.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nDurable competitive advantages\n\nThe size contrast between Facebook and Line continues in examining their durable competitive advantages.\n\nAs of its most recent earnings report, Facebook counted 1.86 billion monthly active users (MAUs) on its core social-networking platform, or about 58% of the world's population that has access to the internet. Beyond this, Facebook owns other social-media platforms and messaging services, such as Instagram (600 million MAUs), Facebook Messenger (1 billion MAUs), and WhatsApp (1 billion MAUs), that are seeing large and growing user counts as well. This immense base of users has allowed Facebook to create the most powerful digital advertising this side of Alphabet . Better still, Facebook is moving into emerging areas of technology, including virtual reality, artificial intelligence, live digital video streaming, and much more. Facebook, in short, has quickly ascended to become one of the most important technology companies on the face of the earth.\n\nLine, on the other hand, is far smaller. As of its most recent earnings report, the company counted 217 million monthly active users on its messaging platform, though 76% of its users are concentrated in just four core markets: Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, and Indonesia. Worse, its user growth declined sequentially from 220 million in its Q3 report, suggesting that Line may be feeling pressure from larger global messaging platforms -- like the ones Facebook owns. The company has moved aggressively to monetize its users through products such as paid stickers, games, and a host of other mobile apps, but the jury remains out on whether Line can translate its regional strength in messaging into a sustainable long-term business. Compared with Facebook, it's clear which company enjoys more substantial durable competitive advantages.\n\nWinner: Facebook.\n\nValuation\n\nA meaningful gap exists between Facebook's and Line's valuations, and for good reason. First, look at three of the most commonly used valuation metrics for both companies:\n\nCompany P/E Forward P/E EV/EBITDA Facebook 39.1 20.4 24.7 Line Corp. 111.8 34.6 34.3\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\n\nAgain, Facebook beats Line across all three valuation statistics. Comparing this performance to their projected future growth rates, analysts estimate that Facebook's earnings per share will grow at an average annual rate of 23.5% over the next five years, versus 39.3% for Line -- which has only one sell-side analyst covering its stock at the moment. I think the key question here is to what extent investors believe in Line's monetization capabilities. If Line can indeed grow its EPS at such above-average rates, Line shares could do quite well. However, the cracks that have emerged in its user growth story give me pause. So let's call this section a draw and move on.\n\nWinner: Tie.\n\nAnd the winner is... Facebook\n\nFacebook remains undeniably stronger than Line, even factoring in Line's higher estimated future growth rates. The Asian messaging platform still has plenty of questions to answer about whether it can continue to expand its uses. On the other hand, Facebook is one of the most powerful and iconic companies in all of tech. It stands as the better buy between the two today.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Facebook\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

To most traders, though, it would seem like it's too late to initiate a long position in GOOGL stock by purchasing shares at $870.\n\nLuckily, you and I have the options markets.\n\nWith GOOGL options, we can design trades that allow for a margin of error. That would give us a lot more confidence going forward; otherwise, our stops would kick in on the first few red days.\n\nLess than 30 days ago, I shared a trade that was designed to be a sure thing . Almost $4 per contract in profits came fast. Today, with those profits in my pocket, I want to \"range trade\" Alphabet stock instead. We could all use a little speculative risk in our portfolio.\n\nThe short story of Alphabet is that fundamentally it's as solid as it gets. It's the king of search, and that's a cash cow that just keeps getting fatter. So with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 30, GOOGL's potential is built in somewhat … but I think it's not fully built in. I think what people are forgetting is that Alphabet can still monetize the billions of users on the Android OS much better than it already is.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nTechnically speaking, Alphabet stock is at all-time highs, but still has room to run. I'd just expect some resistance first.\n\nFor now, then, this is what we'll do.\n\nHow to Trade GOOGL Stock\n\nThe bullish side: Sell the GOOGL 13 Apr $845/$842.5 credit put spread for 40 cents per contract. We have an 80% chance that price will stay above my strike where we need it.\n\nThe bearish side: Sell the GOOGL 13 Apr $887.5/$890 credit call spread for an additional 60 cents per contract. Here, given the upside potential in markets, our chances of success are around 75%.\n\nTaking both trades would constitute a sold iron condor for a total $1 in credit. Since we can only lose on one side or the other, our max risk drops, thereby raising my potential yield above 60% on risk. This trade's delta is much higher than my usual points of entry, and that's what makes it a speculative setup in GOOGL stock.\n\nIn this market, I know we'll need to tightly manage this iron condor. So we shouldn't risk more money than we can afford to lose.\n\nNicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com .

The market, with its rose-colored glasses in full effect, interpreted the hike as dovish.\n\nIn reality, the meeting was neither overly dovish or hawkish. The Fed stuck to its playbook of hiking rates and muting expectations going forward. Their infamous dots still project two more planned hikes this year and three more the year following.\n\nNautilus Research published the following chart noting market action following the third rate hike in a tightening cycle.\n\nThe \"three steps and a stumble\" theory was put forth by late trader and market guru Marty Zweig (he wrote a book worth reading, titled \"Winning on Wall Street\" ). Zweig noticed the market has a tendency to considerably underperform following the third rate hike in a hiking cycle. Here's the following from Nautilus.\n\n\"The SP500 has endured significantly below average results from 1 to 12 months after 3rd rate hikes in 11 events back to 1955. Note that 6 (more than half) of those hikes occurred within a year of a major cyclical top for stocks (1955, 1965, 1968, 1973, 1980, 1999). However, the market defied that relationship on the last occurrence in 2004 by rallying for 3 more years... When looking at all hikes - note that hikes are generally bad for stocks, somewhat bad for the US Dollar, and bullish for 10yr yields and commodities.\"\n\nYale economics professor Robert Shiller, of CAPE ratio and \"Irrational Exuberance\" fame, noted the similarities in sentiment between the current market and that of the late tech bubble in a recent Bloomberg article (an analog we've discussed quite a bit ).\n\n\"They're both revolutionary eras, in the tech boom it was a new era of prosperity brought on by the internet. Now it's a 'Great Leader' has appeared,\" Shiller said. \"The idea is, everything is different.\"\n\nBut no matter how you cut it, Shiller said, \"The market is way overpriced. It is not as intellectual as people would think, or as economists would have you believe.\"\n\nGoing off of the chart below, it is safe to say we are transitioning from the greed to euphoria stage. Take a look at magazine covers and article headlines and it is easy to see the market is entering a new level of optimism and complacency.\n\nAs we progress further into the latter innings of this cycle, and as expectations become more and more dependent on a narrowly defined and exceedinglyoptimistic future , it pays to remember the following from Mark Buchanan's book, \"Ubiquity: Why Catastrophes Happen\" (bolding is mine):\n\n\"In this simplified setting of the sandpile, the power law also points to something else: the surprising conclusion that even the greatest of events have no special or exceptional causes. After all, every avalanche large or small starts out the same way, when a single grain falls and makes the pile just slightly too steep at one point. What makes one avalanche much larger than another has nothing to do with its original cause, and nothing to do with some special situation in the pile just before it starts. Rather, it has to do with the perpetually unstable organization of the critical state, which makes it always possible for the next grain to trigger an avalanche of any size.\"\n\nNote, there will be 11 Fed members speaking this week. Who knows what kind of tone they will take, but it should make for an interesting week.\n\n(The above is an excerpt from our weekly Market Brief.

Since Amazon ( AMZN ) has a negligible presence in the software-as-a-service segment, most of that revenue is coming from the infrastructure-as-a-service segment, which continues to grow at double-digit rates.\n\nMicrosoft 's ( MSFT ) cloud segment has been keeping pace with Amazon on the revenue front, and the company reported a commercial cloud annualized run rate of $14 billion during the most recent quarter. But the difference here is the bulk of Microsoft's cloud revenue is coming from its SaaS portfolio. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which houses Azure along with server products and enterprise services, had only $6.9 billion in revenues during the most recent quarter.\n\nBut Microsoft's advantage is that its SaaS lineup, led by Office 365, has been growing at a phenomenal rate, while Azure revenue has been growing near triple-digit rates for the past several quarters. For Microsoft's SaaS customers, Azure remains one click away. In addition, consumers tend to prefer a single vendor when possible because it reduces a lot of integration and development headaches. Microsoft does stand out from other cloud providers for this reason: nobody else has such a strong SaaS and IaaS offering.\n\nMicrosoft has already positioned itself as the one-stop solution for organizations. You can use Azure to take care of your infrastructure, Office 365 for office collaboration and Dynamics 365 for business management. The further the SaaS lead Microsoft registers, the wider the moat for competition.\n\nAmazon and Alphabet ( GOOG )( GOOGL ) have realized this problem and are quickly moving to address the gap. Google announced several new features and services to G Suite, its office productivity application, while Amazon has Workdocs, Amazon Workmail and Amazon Chime under its belt for office productivity. Amazon Chime, a competitor to Skype, was launched earlier this year, and the company updated Workdocs just yesterday.\n\nAmazon is extremely late to the office collaboration game, while Google let the market slip between its fingers. Microsoft already has 85 million monthly active Office 365 users and is growing fast. Switching from one productivity software vendor to another is easier said than done because there are huge barriers like cost, migration and training involved.\n\nEven if Amazon and Google try to undercut Microsoft by keeping their pricing lower than those of Office 365 subscriptions, it will not be enough to poach users because their products have not yet evolved to be comparable to it. What's more, Microsoft keeps expanding Office 365 services at a furious pace, while keeping a tight rein its own pricing.\n\nBy the time Amazon and Google get their respective products up to par with Microsoft's, the giant will have already captured a huge chunk of market share. Amazon's lead in IaaS and Microsoft's lead in SaaS cannot be erased that easily, and both these companies are going to rule these segments for at least the next few years. Considering the operating margins in these two segments, they are going to be very profitable businesses.\n\nDisclosure: I have no positions in the stock mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.\n\nStart afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .", "The solar industry had another busy week with a number of announcements and earnings reports from some of the largest companies in the business. It was so eventful, in fact, that I can't cover everything in this week's roundup, but I can hit the items investors most need be aware of.\n\nAs the solar industry evolves into a more mature market and players define where they think they'll have a competitive advantage, it's time for investors to start looking at where companies fit into the market and whether they'll have a profitable future. With that context in mind, here are the notable news items from the solar industry this week.\n\nX-Series solar panels on a residential rooftop. Image source: SunPower.\n\nSunPower signs a P-Series supply deal\n\nSunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR) has been laying out its plans for the future, and a central piece of its strategy is based on combining the P-Series solar panel (which uses commodity cells to create a slightly higher efficiency \"commodity-plus\" panel) with the Oasis power plant design. The company is essentially transitioning from the utility-scale project-building business to supplying pre-engineered solutions to developers, like utilities. The strategy makes sense, but we had yet to see much indication that it was taking hold in the market... until this week.\n\nSunPower signed a 125 MW supply agreement with NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) to provide its P-Series modules to the developer between June and October of this year. There wasn't any disclosure about whether the deal included the Oasis tracking system or any design services, but even if it's just a panel supply agreement, it would be a positive sign.\n\nIf deals like this continue to come through in 2017 and SunPower is able to supply panels and other services to developers on short lead times, it would be an immensely positive development. One deal isn't a confirmation that the P-Series/Oasis strategy is a success, but it's a step in the right direction for SunPower shareholders.\n\nGoogle takes Sunroof nationwide\n\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google subsidiary started the Project Sunroof initiative in 2015 to try to give customers and installers an easy view of the solar potential of homes around the country. Initially, the project covered just a few cities, but the idea was to eventually roll it out nationwide. This week, that happened.\n\nProject Sunroof now allows people across the country to quickly view an outline of their home's solar potential, and get an idea of what a solar system might cost them. Installers can be plugged into the search to make sales easier, and I would expect some will even use it as a tool to target sales opportunities. This is one big example of how solar is becoming a little easier for customers to understand and see as accessible, particularly outside of traditional solar hubs such as California and Massachusetts.\n\nTrina Solar goes private\n\nIn a deal that has been in the works for months, Trina Solar was finally taken private this week. The $11.60-per-share offer made by a group led by the CEO looked to be on shakier ground late last year as solar panel prices plunged and demand in the solar market declined, particularly in China.\n\nI questioned whether or not the deal would go through given the questionable history of Chinese buyout offers and the decline in the market overall. But Trina Solar is now private, and the fact that the deal went through may mean management sees a brighter future than many investors currently do.\n\nTakeaways from earnings season\n\nEarnings season is about over for the solar industry, and after JA Solar (NASDAQ: JASO) and Vivint Solar (NYSE: VSLR) reported this week, there were a few major takeaways from the end of 2016 and early 2017.\n\nChinese solar panel manufacturers are down, but not out. Gross margins in the fourth quarter were in the low to mid teens at most manufacturers, and while profitability generally dropped, they were able to cut costs and remain near breakeven levels.\n\nNational residential solar companies are generally in decline and having a tough time transitioning to a market where loan and cash sales are the dominant financing option. Sunrun is the one company that has doubled down on leasing, and it's currently going well for the company. But with SolarCity and Vivint Solar seeing installations decline, there's a lot of uncertainty about what the residential solar industry will look like in the future.\n\nis the one company that has doubled down on leasing, and it's currently going well for the company.

After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*\n\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Wal-Mart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\n\nClick here to learn about these picks!\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of March 6, 2017\n\nThe author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned.\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

When growth slows or a recession strikes, the appetite for construction projects takes a big hit. Luckily for investors, we're currently in the midst of a broad economic expansion.\n\nThat has made construction companies, and specifically those of cement and concrete manufacturers, some of the best-performing stocks over the last three years. Vulcan Materials and Martin Marietta Materials have nearly tripled the returns of the S&P 500 during that period, while the smaller U.S. Concrete (NASDAQ: USCR) has gained an incredible 181%.\n\nAlthough there are great fundamentals supporting the stock's rise, investors appear to be suspicious. Slightly over 28% of the the company's shares are traded short, according to numbers compiled by Yahoo! Finance. There's no denying that shares have outperformed most other stocks, but I think investors are wrong to bet against U.S. Concrete. Here's why.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy short-sellers are wrong\n\nThe stock trades at an eye-popping 125 times trailing earnings, but there's an innocent, if not downright weird, explanation. It may sound odd, but the better the stock performs, the bigger the company's GAAP net loss becomes. That's because U.S. Concrete must account for non-cash derivative gains and losses from fair value changes in its issued warrants when the stock price moves down or up, respectively, in any given period.\n\nThe good news is that recent quarterly GAAP net losses have no impact on the company's cash position and have not had major impacts on the share price. The great news is that operations have maintained a strong level of performance for several years in a row.\n\nU.S. Concrete notched $75 million in operating income and $1.17 billion in revenue in 2016. Those metrics grew 235% and 95%, respectively, from the performance achieved three years ago. Operating cash flow reached $112 million last year, which was well above the $24 million achieved in 2013.\n\nIn other words, the stock has certainly earned its 181% gain in the last three years.\n\nUSCR data by YCharts .\n\nThat said, there's a strong case to be made that the company's growth isn't over. Unlike other cement and concrete manufacturers, U.S. Concrete has strategically (and almost exclusively) focused on major metropolitan areas in Texas, New York/New Jersey, and northern California. Those markets were responsible for 38%, 31%, and 25%, respectively, of total revenue in 2016. There are several advantages to that strategy that short-sellers may be overlooking.\n\nFirst, it allows the company to strategically acquire assets to become a major and dominant player in each region and city. Consider that in 2016 alone, U.S. Concrete acquired four smaller ready-mix concrete operators in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. The acquisitions provided the company with 10 ready-mix concrete plants and 189 mixer trucks. In addition to swiping away competition, the acquisitions allow the company to make more competitive bids on larger projects. And in New York City, there are some pretty big projects.\n\nIn fact, the company supplied the concrete that built the new World Trade Center Complex, including Freedom Tower, which was the highest height concrete has ever been pumped in North America. Expansions at LaGuardia Airport and the Modern Museum of Art were also aided by the company, as are other major ongoing projects in the New York, Dallas-Fort Worth, and San Francisco metropolitan areas.\n\nSecond, extending its leadership position in each major market allows U.S. Concrete to have a greater influence on product pricing. The fourth quarter of 2016 marked the 23rd straight quarter that the company achieved year-over-year ready-mix concrete price increases. That has an obviously beneficial impact on revenue and margins, and it has played a huge role in the company's industry-leading margins in the ready-mix concrete segment. Whereas the average material spread margin in the industry was 45% last year, U.S. Concrete achieved 49.2%.\n\nUS Industrial Production: Cement data by YCharts .\n\nThird, operating in urban environments allows the company to benefit from environmental considerations and initiatives, such as LEED building certifications. Humans manufacture more cement than any other material. Unfortunately, cement is also one of the most carbon-intensive materials to produce, accounting for 5% of total global CO2 emissions each year. While certain materials can be substituted into cement production processes, they can significantly alter the performance of mixed concrete. In other words, it's not easy being green.\n\nLuckily, U.S. Concrete is a leading producer of low CO2 concrete. The company's EF Technology can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with cement production by between 42% and 46%. Today, over 30% of concrete used by the company benefits from the technology. That allows it to place highly competitive bids on major construction projects with LEED requirements -- an increasingly important consideration. That's especially true in environmentally conscious San Francisco, where the company has won projects including the Google Bayview Campus, the Workday Campus, and even the Golden State Warriors Arena.\n\nWhat does it mean for investors?\n\nIt takes a bit of digging around the company's primary strategy and the driving forces for the industry at large, but I think short-sellers are wrong about this stock. The only way short-sellers could be right about U.S. Concrete stock is if the American economy heads for a slowdown, which would have much broader consequences. While that's not impossible -- in fact, with recessions occurring every eight years or so, we're \"due\" for one -- it's unlikely to sneak up on investors. The company works off of a backlog of projects that are agreed to years prior, which provides fair warning to shareholders of potential trouble on the horizon. Right now, though, there appears to be consistent growth ahead for the foreseeable future.\n\n10 stocks we like better than US Concrete\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The most recent third-party estimate from Canalys pegs AWS global market share at nearly 34% in the fourth quarter, larger than the next three largest competitors -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , and IBM -- combined (31%).\n\nCompetition is heating up, and rivals are starting to chip away at AWS' dominance.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAWS is hugely important to the Amazon thesis\n\nThat's the underlying theme of a research note from Pacific Crest (via Tech Trader Daily ). Analyst Brent Bracelin is reiterating an overweight rating but slightly reducing his price target from $905 to $895, while expressing some concern that Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are starting to catch up and \"becom[e] more viable.\" The software and search giants both continue to invest heavily in their cloud offerings, both in terms of technical capability as well as geographic expansion and reach.\n\nSince AWS is immensely more profitable that Amazon's core e-commerce business, its results carry a disproportionate weight when it comes to the bottom line, and strong AWS performance has been a key driver of Amazon's rally over the past two years, which has seen shares more than double.\n\nAMZN data by YCharts .\n\nMicrosoft Azure is making inroads at large enterprise customers and government agencies, which are increasingly transitioning their needs away from their own data center infrastructures and toward public cloud platforms. Google Cloud has scored a high-profile win in Snap , which has committed to spending $2 billion with the search giant and is only using AWS as a backup . Google also recently announced a handful of other big wins for its cloud business.\n\nBracelin still believes that AWS has a \"multiyear competitive lead,\" despite rivals starting to catch up in different ways. As a result, he is tempering his expectations for growth for the next two years. Overall, the analyst considers decelerating growth a \"minor concern,\" but it's definitely something that should be on investors' radar.\n\nRising cloud use lifts all infrastructure vendors\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the cloud infrastructure market is growing so fast -- up 49% last year and expected to jump another 46% this year -- that there should be plenty to go around. The cloud infrastructure market could generate a total of $55.8 billion in total revenue this year. Of course, the dominant vendors will compete aggressively, but we're not talking about zero-sum competition.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

IHS Automotive forecasts that autonomous vehicle sales will shoot up from 600,000 units in 2025 to almost 21 million by 2035, clocking a compound annual growth rate of 43%.\n\nThe Boston Consulting Group, meanwhile, expects the driverless car market to create a $42 billion revenue opportunity in 2025 itself, indicating that there is a lot of money to be made in this space. One of the ways to tap this huge opportunity is through technology providers such as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) , as they will play mission-critical roles in enabling autonomous cars.\n\nNVIDIA's GPUs are boosting self-driving technology\n\nNVIDIA is best known for making gaming graphics cards, but its products are in high demand from automakers as well. Tesla , for instance, is using the chipmaker's artificial intelligence-based DRIVE PX2 platform in the Model S and Model X cars. What's more, the automaker is also going to deploy NVIDIA's supercomputer in its mass-market Model 3.\n\nThe Tesla partnership is already delivering results, as NVIDIA's automotive revenue shot up over 37% year over year for the fiscal fourth quarter. The company could sustain its automotive momentum, as it is working with German giant Audi to bring a Level 4 autonomous car to the market by 2020. Level 4 means it can drive itself entirely on its own.\n\nThe two companies showcased an Audi Q7 at CES earlier this year, claiming that the car learned to drive on its own in just four days using NVIDIA's AI-based DRIVE PX2 supercomputer. More importantly, NVIDIA is looking to push the envelope: It's now working on a more advanced supercomputing platform -- Xavier -- that consumes less power but packs more computing capacity.\n\nNVIDIA's graphics processing units accelerate the processing of huge amounts of data in real time, allowing the vehicle to make quick decisions. As the company increasingly turns its attention toward making its self-driving supercomputers better through partnerships with big auto companies, it won't be surprising if its platform ends up powering fully autonomous cars by 2020.\n\nNVIDIA, therefore, looks right on the edge of tapping the driverless car opportunity, as 80 companies are using the DRIVE PX2 platform to develop their technology.\n\nMicrosoft's big data opportunity\n\nDriverless cars, or any connected car for that matter, will generate huge volumes of data from their sensors and cameras that will need storage and processing. Microsoft wants to ingest all this data and then use its artificial intelligence (AI) skills to analyze it to help cars drive better through its Azure cloud-based Connected Vehicle Platform.\n\nImage source: Microsoft.\n\nThe Redmond-based company has picked a sweet spot to tap the driverless car opportunity, as a connected vehicle is slated to produce 20 gigabytes of data per day in 2017 if driven for just two hours. In the case of autonomous cars, the data generation could be at least 10 gigabytes per second. Now, all this data can't be stored on the car itself due to limited storage capacity, creating an opportunity for Microsoft to push its cloud product to automakers.\n\nThe Renault-Nissan alliance has already decided to use the software giant's connected vehicle platform, pledging to put 10 cars with autonomous technology on the road by 2020. Additionally, Indian automaker Tata Motors is adopting the platform to bring connectivity features and predictive maintenance at affordable prices to mass-market vehicles in India.\n\nMicrosoft is also finding demand for its connected car platform beyond automakers. For instance, reinsurance provider Swiss Re will analyze driving behavior with the help of the telematics data collected by the cloud, and then create customized insurance deals for customers.\n\nThe inevitable data increase from driverless and connected cars could power Microsoft's Azure cloud business to new highs in the long run, allowing it to sustain rapid revenue growth from this segment.\n\nImage source: Waymo.\n\nAlphabet's Waymo moonshot could be a big business\n\nAlphabet's Waymo division has the best driverless car technology, according to data from the California DMV. As it turns out, its driverless cars have the lowest incidence rates and the highest miles logged compared to the others testing their technology on California roads.\n\nAlphabet can use its lead in this space by becoming an infrastructure and knowledge supplier to auto companies, and this is what it is probably planning to do. Earlier this year, Waymo announced that it is going to manufacture driverless-technology-enabling sensors on its own so that it can better integrate the software into hardware.\n\nIn fact, the Waymo division has slashed the price of the crucial LIDAR sensor by 90% since 2009, so it makes sense for it to offer a packaged hardware-software bundle to potential customers. The company has already gained a customer in the form of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles for its self-driving technology, with Bloomberg reporting that both companies could eventually roll out a ride-sharing service.\n\nOn the other hand, Honda seems to be warming up to Waymo's self-driving capabilities to accelerate its own driverless car development. The Japanese automaker is now exploring the possibility of equipping its cars with fully autonomous driving technology in cities instead of its earlier ambition of just highway driving.\n\nTherefore, Alphabet's years of leadership in driverless cars make it one of the hottest prospects to benefit from this emerging technology.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For those who don't know, FANG consists of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) - formerly Google.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhy has this group been so successful? Despite a few of them sporting lofty valuations, they are the respective kings of their industries. Facebook dominates social media, Netflix owns streaming, Amazon is the king of e-commerce and Google owns the online search engine.\n\nOver the past five years, Alphabet is the worst performing of the FANG stocks, returning \"just\" 180%. After that, it's Facebook, which has generated 265%. Amazon's 360% return stands out and Netflix's 830% gain jumps off the page. Have these stocks gone too far, though?\n\nI wouldn't necessarily argue that. Some names warrant some extra caution in my view, however. Let's take a further look to see which stocks are worth holding onto and which are worth taking profits in.\n\nFANG Stocks: Facebook (FB)\n\nSource: The Crunchies! via Flickr\n\nWe'll keep the FANG stocks in order, so let's begin with Facebook . Facebook has impressively captivated billions of users through its platform. At last check, Facebook catered to 1.23 billion daily active users, an 18% increase year-over-year. Monthly active users of 1.86 billion increased 17% year-over-year.\n\nEven more impressively, Facebook has found a way to grow its revenue growth. That may seem like a typo, but it's not. FB has managed to not only grow sales on a year-over-year basis, but also accelerate that rate of growth as well. After impressively growing sales in the 40% to 49% range through fiscal 2015, FB has now managed 50%+ revenue growth for five consecutive quarters. Obviously the company has found a way to continually grow and its users are not tiring of its various ad formats.\n\nFB stock is not egregiously priced either; with a forward price-earnings ratio of just 21, Facebook shares are not that expensive with earnings per share expected to grow 28.1% this year and 23.4% next year.\n\nThrow in the fact that Facebook has topped earnings expectations over the past 13 quarters and the stock becomes even more attractive. Shares have been on a tear this year. But a pullback to its 50-day moving average near $131 could be a buying opportunity.\n\nFANG Stocks: Amazon (AMZN)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAMZN stock has also done well in 2017, up 14%. We all know about the decaying retail sector and Amazon's ability to capitalize on that weakness. But judging the future of commerce can be difficult, especially with how quickly Amazon continues to move.\n\nThe biggest concern for Amazon skeptics has been earnings. Despite years of 20%-plus revenue growth, AMZN's bottom line has hugged the flatline. Management argues that it's investing in itself for even more growth and so far, investors have been patient. They've also been rewarded. Over the past 10 years, shares are up more than 2,000%. Thankfully, Amazon started to pad its bottom line with its Web Services cloud business.\n\nWhile I personally love Amazon, I would be a bit leery of AMZN stock at these prices. Just last year we found out the hard way how fast things can change with sentiment. In the beginning of 2016, AMZN stock stumbled from $675 to sub-$500 in just five weeks. That 26% haircut startled plenty of investors, despite the stock rebounding to north of $800 a share within a year.\n\nThe lesson here is simple: Amazon shares are not invincible during pullbacks. Should we get a notable broader market correction, AMZN stock will not be spared. That is the best time to buy the stock . Now that it's through the holiday season and continues to invest at a heavy pace , shares could struggle in the intermediate term.\n\nA decline to its 200-day moving average would be a great place to initiate a long position. That mark is currently near $780 per share. Any further declines could be used to accumulate the stock.\n\nFANG Stocks: Netflix (NFLX)\n\nSource: Via Netflix\n\nNFLX stock is one a lot of investors are kicking themselves over. Shares languished below $100 through most of 2016. At the time, some feared higher content costs and sloppy overseas execution.\n\nThose fears still exist to some point, but Netflix has shown better execution as of late. As a result, shares have catapulted to north of $140. The stock has been consolidating nicely around this level. With the 50-day moving average just below, it appears Netflix may be setting up for a move to new all-time highs .\n\nInvestors who want to buy now could use the 50-day moving average - or a price just below - as their stop-loss. They could also wait for a possible decline to its 200-day moving average, currently just below $115, to buy. Longer-term investors may consider initiating a position in the name, with a plan to purchase more on additional declines.\n\nThe problem with NFLX stock is simple: valuation. Not many investors question the shift in video content consumption. The trend is in favor of Netflix, which holds a dominant position in the streaming world. I consider Netflix a very battleground-based stock. On the one hand, it's trailing P/E ratio of 384 is near the top of its five-year range. On the other hand, its forward P/E ratio is the lowest it's been in the same time frame.\n\nThe streaming offerings from Alphabet's YouTube, as well as Hulu could also be a concern. For now, the bulls seem to be in control of NFLX stock. Should Netflix's execution deteriorate or competition eat into its growth, the narrative may change. But for now, staying long Netflix seems like it will work.\n\nFANG Stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLike Facebook, one of the main attractions to Alphabet is actually the valuation. Trading at 21.8 times next year's earnings, shares of Alphabet aren't priced too expensive. Analysts expect GOOGL to churn out earnings growth of 17.5% next year, along with 19.3% annual earnings growth over the next five years.\n\nAlphabet's founders may have paved the way for internet domination. But there's a new team member to its C-suite that has given GOOGL a much-needed boost. CFO Ruth Porat joined the company in May 2015.\n\nIn the year leading up to her hire, shares had been stagnant, returning just 5%. Since her addition, though, the stock is up a whopping 60%. Does it also seem like a coincidence that Alphabet missed analysts' estimates on at least six straight quarters prior to her arrival? Since then, Alphabet has topped estimates in five of the past six quarters.\n\nAdmittedly, Alphabet's transparency has been better, making it easier for analysts to form estimates. But this added clarity makes it easier on investors and helps lower volatility. For better or for worse, Alphabet takes some gambles. For instance, consider Alphabet's self-driving car unit, Waymo. Porat has not stifled this growth. Rather, she has reigned in expenses and channeled GOOGL's focus. As a result, the bottom line has improved, without future potential being eliminated .\n\nWith a consistent core business in Google and potential upsides in businesses like Waymo, GOOGL stock is attractive. With its dependable growth and a reasonable valuation, it's even better. At just a hair under all-time highs, though, now may not be the best time to buy. A retest of its 50-day moving average near $840 and a further decline to its 200-day moving average near $800 would offer better entry opportunities.\n\nAs of this writing, Bret Kenwell did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nThe post 4 Famous Tech Stocks That Could Lose Their Fangs appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Reuters\n\nUPDATE 1-French ad group Havas says only UK unit pulling adverts from Google\n\n\n\n(Adds Havas statement) PARIS, March 17 (Reuters) - French advertising group Havas said on Friday that it would not pull advertising from Alphabet Inc's <GOOG.O> Google platforms on a global basis, after its British business suspended activity with the U.S. company over concerns about its YouTube website.

Maybe it's due to fear of a sector that, as a whole, is often considered to be higher risk than other, less dynamic industries. But there are a select few companies that, thanks to their dominant competitive advantages, offer an excellent low-risk way for investors to profit from emerging technologies. Read on to learn about one of the best.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAll hail the king\n\nFew businesses are as dominant within their respective industries as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . The parent company of Google gives investors an opportunity beyond a core Internet search business that legendary investor Charlie Munger once described as having the largest competitive moat he's ever seen.\n\nWith a more than 90% share of the global search engine market, Google is the undisputed king of search. Yet it refuses to grow complacent; it's constantly expanding its reach with an ever-growing array of services. It now possesses an incredible collection of platforms that serve more than 1 billion users each, including YouTube, Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Google Play, and now Google Cloud . Together, they serve to expand and strengthen Google's powerful ecosystem and widen its competitive moat.\n\nMoreover, Google generates enormous amounts of cash, to the tune of nearly $26 billion in 2016, which it has used to build a fortress-like balance sheet with more than $86 billion in cash and less than $4 billion in debt. This financial strength allows it to invest aggressively in research and development, and in the acquisition of companies that are leading the way in important new technologies. All of this, combined with Google's renowned culture of innovation, helps it remain at the forefront of technological change.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nOther bets\n\nIt's this innovation that necessitated its reorganization into its current \" Alphabet \" structure. The design is brilliant, as it sends a clear message about what the company has become: a collection of businesses with investments in a far-ranging array of exciting technologies that are poised to pay increasing returns to shareholders in the years ahead.\n\nAlphabet's holding company structure allows disparate businesses -- such as self-driving technology leader Waymo , life sciences company Verily , and connected home device maker Nest -- to be run and scaled independently. Management believes this will give these \"other bets\" their best chance at receiving the resources and attention they need to succeed over the long term.\n\nAlphabet therefore gives investors many ways to win. The company's core Google business is as dominant as they come, which helps to lower Alphabet's overall risk profile. And the company's other bets have in many ways become analogous to an emerging technology fund overseen by two of the greatest minds on the planet: co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. It's the perfect balance of market dominance and optionality; cash flow and reinvestment opportunity; current success and future growth potential.\n\nValuation\n\nAt first glance, Alphabet's forward price-to-earnings ratio in the low 20's may seem a bit expensive compared to the S&P 500's forward P/E of about 18. But if you adjust for the more than $82 billion in net cash it has on its balance sheet -- which equates to about $119 per share -- Alphabet's ex-cash P/E drops to less than 19. On that basis, Alphabet's stock is quite a bargain, especially considering its superior growth rates compared to the market as a whole.\n\nMoreover, investors who buy shares today will be buying alongside Alphabet itself. The company has a $7 billion share repurchase program currently under way -- a figure that's likely to continue to grow along with Alphabet's ever rising cash flows. These share buybacks should further help to support Alphabet's stock price, and they signal management's increasing willingness to return capital to shareholders.\n\nAll told, Alphabet offers retirees an excellent and relatively low-risk way to profit from emerging technologies -- a high potential field that's often underrepresented in retirement portfolios.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares)\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Lower sales also dented operating income, which dropped 36% to $7.4 million. All told, net income tumbled 34% to $5.2 million, and earnings per share decreased 35% to $0.22.\n\nLooking forward\n\nIn response to this challenging retail environment, Movado is implementing multiple cost-saving initiatives and devoting more resources to its e-commerce business. \"Given the evolution of the retail market place, we are consolidating certain operations and shifting a greater portion of our investment into the continued development and growth of our digital footprint, including allocating a larger percentage of our marketing budget to online venues,\" said Grinberg.\n\n\"We are fully committed in our investments in digital and are very pleased with the multiple initiatives underway,\" added President Ricardo Quintero during a conference call with analysts. \"Movado.com was our fastest-growing business unit with double-digit increases and our digital advertising and social media footprint continues to grow and gain traction.\"\n\nTo further adapt to changing consumer preferences, Movado is also expanding its lineup of smartwatches by partnering with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google. \"While we believe in the continued growth potential of the traditional watch category, we are also excited about our recently announced partnership with Google to launch a new smartwatch collection, Movado Connect,\" Grinberg said.\n\nStill, Movado is reducing its workforce in an attempt to cut operating costs by $12 million in fiscal 2018 and $15 million annually thereafter. The company expects to record a pre-tax charge of approximately $7 million to $10 million related to these initiatives, mostly in the first quarter. \"We are decisive in our commitment to become a leaner, more agile organization, rightsized to the current operating environment and making smart resource allocations against the biggest opportunities with a focus on delivering sustainable, profitable growth in the long run,\" Quintero said .\n\nIn all, Movado's fiscal 2018 full-year outlook includes:\n\nNet sales in a range of $515 million to $530 million.\n\nOperating income of $50 million to $55 million.\n\nNet income of $33 million to $36.3 million, or $1.40 to $1.55 per share.\n\n\"Looking into fiscal 2018, we continue to believe there are many opportunities in the watch category,\" added Quintero. \"Innovation is the lifeline of our business and we are committed to continuing to lead, with superior watch design in the traditional watch category as well as in the connected segment.\"\n\n10 stocks we like better than Movado Group\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If you're driving to work and leaving your car in a parking garage all day, you're really not getting the benefits of it being able to navigate and drive itself. They're really meant to be used to be driving all day long. And when you do that, you get a higher utilization out of the vehicle, and that really brings the cost of them down. And you have powerful things behind the scenes. You have neural networks, and all the chips that aren't really cheap. This is really the way that these are meant to be used, to be in fleets. Uber and Hertz and all the large fleets and self-driving taxis are really aiming to do this. As far as South by Southwest, you were asking some of the things we learned, we found out that about half the world's population is in cities today, and that's going to grow to about two-thirds by 2050. So, we're going to be moving from about 3.5 billion people in cities today to 7 billion within the next 30 years or so. And you can't just keep building out more and more suburbs and highways and parking garages as infrastructure to have this many people moving into the cities. It needs to be a better-designed city. And I think we're going to see self-driving cars play a key role in how cities are actually designing themselves to accommodate for the population boom.\n\nO'Reilly: Yeah, I remember another Fool, Armun Asgari, he had that piece back in October, The Race to Autonomy: An Investor's Guide to Self-Driving Cars . It's a bit of a read, but it was awesome. And one of the things that it's common sense that he points out is, the average American family owns 2.2 cars, and it's a $30,000-$50,000 asset that is rapidly depreciating. Wouldn't it be nice to get some use out of that? Wouldn't it be nice if our cities weren't just these monoliths of concrete to park these things that aren't being used 95% of the time? Did you see anything hard or tangible down at the conference there, on this trend?\n\nErickson: There were sessions. It was more academic, as far as what we had seen at South by Southwest. In terms of use cases, though, I think Singapore is one that we can keep an eye on, if you want to see this in action right now. Singapore, of course, is a city that likes to monitor everything. There's no littering there. They're really cracking down on only smoking in certain areas. It's a very oversight city, so, they're really ahead of the curve on monitoring things. Even today, Sean, they have their analog for Uber. It's a company called Grab, who's teamed up with another company called NuTonomy that's already got self-driving cars navigating around the city, picking people up, basically a taxi service that is happening right now. There is an engineer in the passenger seat just for the peace of mind for the riders. But they're planning to have 100 driverless cars within the next year. This is something that's already happening out there -- you can actually get into a car that's navigating itself to the location for you.\n\nO'Reilly: Throughout Singapore, yeah. Can I ask what kind of car is it? I know that Uber was testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh, and I believe they were Volvo crossover SUVs or something. Do you know any of that stuff off the top of your head?\n\nErickson: Yeah, it is Volvo for the U.S. for Uber for self-driving cars. There's also a company called Otto for self-driving trucks, which could be for transport.\n\nO'Reilly: Wow. I have to go to my local Volvo dealership and see if they have an engineer sitting around that can take me out on one of these things.\n\nErickson: I have a crazy futuristic idea for you, also.\n\nO'Reilly: Is this better than the driverless luggage?\n\nErickson: It is. And you knew, when you invited me on the show, being an Explorer , futuristic kind of guy, that I was going to have to throw some ideas like this to you, right?\n\nO'Reilly: I'm all ears.\n\nErickson: The economics are such that the average taxi fare, in the U.S., is charging about $3.50 a mile. Pretty expensive. And it's generally accepted that by 2021, when we're expecting autonomous vehicles to really start going mainstream, that the cost of an autonomous car will cost in the neighborhood of $0.30 a mile. Less than a tenth of the cost today. Now, when you get to that kind of price point, Sean, that opens up a lot of options of who is actually paying $0.30 a mile per trip for customers. And the idea would be, this can be subsidized by advertising companies like Google, where you can get into an autonomous car. Yeah. Get in for a free ride. It'll bring you within a 10-mile radius, or whatever the distance would be. It'll cost Google maybe $3 for your trip, at $0.30 a mile. But in exchange, they have your undivided attention that they can serve you ads in the car.\n\nO'Reilly: Oh, my gosh. I mean, I would obviously just look at my phone or read a book. But that's awesome.\n\nErickson: Yeah, especially when you consider the numbers that you threw out earlier. The average American is spending a third of their household income every year on these rapidly depreciating assets that we call cars. It doesn't have to be that way when you start getting into the discussion of $0.30 a mile.\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

This includes removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. This change will enable it to take action, where appropriate, on a larger set of ads and sites.\n\nGoogle noted that it will also tighten safeguards to ensure that ads show up only against legitimate creators in YouTube Partner Programâ€\"as opposed to those who impersonate other channels or violate community guidelines. Finally, It won't stop at taking down ads. The YouTube team is taking a hard look at existing community guidelines to determine what content is allowed on the platformâ€\"not just what content can be monetized.\n\nGoogle said, in the coming days and months, it is introducing new tools for advertisers to more easily and consistently manage where their ads appear across YouTube and the web.\n\nGoogle will introduce new account-level controls to make it easier for advertisers to exclude specific sites and channels from all of their AdWords for Video and Google Display Network campaigns, and manage brand safety settings across all their campaigns with a push of a button.\n\nIn addition, Google noted that it will introduce new controls to make it easier for brands to exclude higher risk content and fine-tune where they want their ads to appear.\n\nGoogle stated that it will offer advertisers and agencies more transparency and visibility on where their ads are running, and in the coming months it will expand availability of video-level reporting to all advertisers.\n\nThe company noted that it will be hiring significant numbers of people and developing new tools powered by our latest advancements in AI and machine learning to increase our capacity to review questionable content for advertising. In cases where advertisers find their ads were served where they shouldn't have been, the company plans to offer a new escalation path to make it easier for them to raise issues. In addition, the company said it will soon be able to resolve these cases in less than a few hours.\n\nPhilipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, said in a blog, \"We believe the combination of these new policies and controls will significantly strengthen our ability to help advertisers reach audiences at scale, while respecting their values.\"\n\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\n\nhttp://www.rttnews.com\n\nThis article appears in: Stocks , World Markets , Stocks", "Shutterstock photo\n\n\n\n\n\n(RTTNews.com) - SoftBank Group Corp. scrapped a planned $100 million investment in a smartphone startup founded by the creator of Google's Android software, partly because of the Japanese investor's increasingly close relationship with Apple Inc., the Wall Street Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe planned investment would have valued the startup, Essential Products Inc., at $1 billion. It had already been agreed to informally, and final investment contracts were being drawn up, the report said.\n\nThe offer banked on the pedigree of Essential founder Andy Rubin, who sold his previous startup, Android, to Googleâ€\"now a unit of Alphabet Inc.â€\"in 2005, then helped turn its software into the world's most used smartphone operating system, powering devices rivaling Apple's iPhone.\n\nIn January, Apple agreed to commit $1 billion to the Vision Fund. Though Apple didn't block the Essential deal, according to the journal, its investment complicated SoftBank's interest in a competing smartphone company.

Still, a few stocks left investors reeling today, including Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) DryShips (NASDAQ: DRYS) , and Sonic Corporation (NASDAQ: SONC) . Let's take a closer look at what drove these declines.\n\nIs Google losing its advertising mojo?\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet fell a modest half percent after Pivotal Research group analyst Brian Wieser downgraded his rating on shares to hold from buy, expressing concern that advertisers are pulling marketing investments from the internet search titan's platforms over concerns regarding the placement of their ads. To blame, Pivotal says, was a Times of London report (may require subscription) last month indicating video ads from several well-known brands were seen displayed on neo-Nazi and jihadist websites.\n\nImage source: Alphabet.\n\nIn particular, Pivotal notes global advertising company Havas opted to stop spending on YouTube and Google display ads last week, while separate reports indicate several industry giants like McDonald's , HSBC , and Audi are all considering similar moves to pull away from Google advertising.\n\n\"While Google has apologized for the incidents,\" Wieser added, \"and while the scale of the underlying problem may be relatively small in absolute terms, for larger marketers any one instance of an inappropriate brand placement may be enough to seriously harm a brand's business value.\"\n\nDryShips' big offering\n\nNext, shares of dry bulk shipping company DryShips dropped more than 17% after the company filed for a massive $2 billion mixed shelf offering . The move gives DryShips the flexibility to sell a variety of its securities to raise money including common shares, preferred shares debt securities, warrants, purchase contracts, rights, and units, and provides no specific time table or limit to the number of offerings it can employ to do so.\n\nDryships has already gone through a staggering transformation over the past year, from selling ships to pay debt, raising capital and opening revolving credit facilities to solidify its balance sheet, and announcing its strategic expansion in the gas carrier market just over two months ago. But this mixed shelf offering means more dilution for shareholders is likely coming, even after the company's questionable decision to initiate a fixed $2.5 million quarterly dividend a few weeks ago.\n\nSonic gives one analyst indigestion\n\nFinally, shares of drive-in restaurant chain Sonic fell 3% after receiving a downgrade to hold from buy at Canaccord Genuity. Canaccord also reduced its per-share price target on Sonic to $24 from $30 -- shares currently trade just above $23 -- citing a trend of softer sales lately and longer-term concerns over increasing competition from \"non-traditional venues\" like convenience stores.\n\nWhat's more, the analyst firm believes Sonic's recent discounting will continue, and that its lack of new menu innovation will do it no favors in today's difficult dining industry environment. As it stands, investors should receive more clarity on Sonic's business when the company releases fiscal second-quarter 2017 results next week. But in the meantime, this downgrade has pushed Sonic stock to near a fresh 52-week low.\n\nOffer from The Motley Fool: The 10 best stocks to buy now\n\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Image source: Uber Technologies.\n\nTwo explanations for Jones's departure\n\nWhy Jones left depends on who you ask.\n\nIf you ask Uber, or at least Kalanick, Jones' decision to depart followed an announcement that Uber has decided to seek a strong chief operating officer to assist Kalanick in running the compnay. In a note to Uber staff on Sunday, Kalanick said that Jones \"came to the tough decision that he doesn't see his future at Uber\" after the announcement, according to a Recode report .\n\nBut if you ask Jones, it was a little more complicated. In a statement provided to Recode, Jones said, \"It is now clear, however, that the beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber, and I can no longer continue as president of the ride-sharing business.\"\n\nWhy Jones might have decided to get out now\n\nFor starters, Uber's decision to seek a COO was spurred by an embarrassing video that showed Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver over fare reductions that the driver claimed had hurt his income. It also followed a former Uber employee's serious, credible allegation of a pattern of sexual harassment at the company.\n\nUber has hired two outside law firms to conduct investigations related to the former employee's claims. One will investigate her claims specifically, the other is conducting a broader investigation into Uber's workplace practices.\n\nIn what may be related developments, two other executives have departed recently:\n\nUber's senior vice president of engineering, Amit Singhal, resigned after a reporter from Recode informed the company that Singhal had left a prior job at Google following a \"credible\" allegation of sexual harassment.\n\nUber's vice president of product and growth, Ed Baker, also resigned following allegations that he had been seen kissing an Uber employee at a company event.\n\nThere's more. The New York Times reported earlier this month that Uber has been using a software tool called \"Greyball\" to deceive authorities in markets where its service had been pressured by law enforcement or banned.\n\nAnd in perhaps the most dangerous development for the future of Uber's business, Alphabet 's Waymo self-driving subsidiary has sued Uber, claiming that the head of Uber's self-driving research program, Anthony Levandowski, took proprietary technology secrets with him when he left Google in early 2016 to found self-driving truck start-up Otto, which Uber acquired last summer . Waymo is seeking to halt Uber's self-driving operations. (Uber has called Waymo's allegations \"baseless,\" but hasn't yet responded in detail.)\n\nLong story short: Uber's growth story could be in serious trouble.\n\nThe latest sign that Uber could be in serious trouble\n\nTaken together, the recent reports paint a picture of a company where sexual harassment is tolerated, laws are seen as inconveniences to be circumvented, and a showcase technology effort might be based on stolen secrets.\n\nThat's all bad for obvious reasons, and for one reason that might be a little less obvious: Like all tech companies, Uber is in a constant battle to hire and retain top talent. These kinds of stories hurt.\n\nJones, who had come to Uber from Target just six months ago, apparently decided that he had seen enough. But his departure raises a big question: What will Uber's valuation look like the next time it has to raise money -- or when it attempts to go public?\n\n10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's what is likely to happen when Uber goes public.\n\nRight now, Uber is said to be worth $69 billion after taking losses of $2.2 billion during the first nine months of 2016. Its 2016 revenues were estimated at $5.5 billion, and it is not unusual for fast-growing companies to sustain losses as they invest to keep the growth going.\n\nValuing a company at 12.5 times revenue when it seems to be at the peak of its performance may seem to make sense for wealthy Silicon Valley investors, but here in the real world, we have a word for that kind of offer, and the word is no.\n\nTrouble Ahead, Trouble Behind for Uber\n\nUber drivers are not employees. They are, in theory, business partners who pay Uber a commission to bring them work driving people around. They are unlicensed taxi drivers who don't pay for medallions and are thus subject to harassment by the government.\n\nBut the Uber drivers I have met are incredibly professional, and their cars are clean, thanks in part to a \"Vehicle Solutions\" program that lets them rent, lease or buy new or nearly new cars. This is how the company has grown.\n\nBut relying on contractors carries risks . Uber is said to have a \"toxic\" work culture, one rife with sexual abuse , leading to a Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) campaign advocating that customers delete the app .\n\nCEO Travis Kalanick described his corporate culture as \"baller,\" and once joked to a magazine that calling the company \"Boober\" was fine because it got him sex.\n\nPando Daily founder Sarah Lacy has been an especially harsh critic , and political polarization now seems to be having an effect, as rival Lyft has reportedly grown 7% in just the last two months, although both companies have seen less traffic lately .\n\nSelf-Driving Mess\n\nFor investors, Uber's biggest risk may lie in its efforts to get into the self-driving car business.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ), the parent of Google and Waymo , a self-driving car pioneer, has filed a legal complaint charging that Uber stole Waymo's trade secrets by having an employee walk out with them, founding a company called Otto, then buying Otto for $700 million. If Alphabet wins the case, it could take Uber completely out of that business.\n\nUber is also challenging Google Maps, pushing its own system on drivers , one that will make their driving fit corporate needs. It also gives the company a direct online connection to drivers.\n\nUber's fraught relations with competitors, drivers and government is now a global phenomenon . Competition from new entrants is also increasing, even in Africa.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBuying Uber stock is based on a belief that the company will grow, but it's more likely that Uber is now at the replacement end of the curve, where growth slows down.\n\nBuying Uber in hopes of getting into the self-driving \"cars as a service\" craze is also risky, because Uber's ownership of the necessary intellectual property is under question.\n\nThe risk of venture capitalists holding companies through their period of maximum growth is always that they will hold on too long, that they will be unable to exit the investment on their own timetable - that they will, in the end, get too greedy.\n\nThat's what has happened here. When Uber goes public, wait for all lock-up periods to expire before considering an investment. See what its full value is before you buy. Don't bet on the hype of the IPO. Treat Uber as the mature company it is.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist. He is the author of the sci-fi novella Into the Cloud , available at the Amazon Kindle store.

After releasing it exclusively to Prime members in late 2014, the device proved so popular that Amazon was able to quickly open orders to everyone in the U.S. by the following summer. On Christmas Eve of 2015, the Echo was one of the top five items ordered, according to Amazon's annual holiday press release. Last year, Echo device sales climbed nine times compared to 2015's holiday season.\n\nThat's despite the November introduction of Google Home, a competing smart speaker from the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary. During Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call, RBC analyst Mark Mahaney suggested Echo devices, powered by the virtual assistant Alexa, outsold Google Home 10-to-1 in the quarter.\n\nBut Mahaney is changing his tune after conducting a more in-depth survey. \"Home's awareness and installed base could be much closer to Alexa -- with a brand awareness in the U.S. 80% that of Alexa and an installed base that may be close to a third that of Alexa,\" he recently wrote in a note.\n\nIt looks like Google Home is quickly catching up to Amazon's Echo.\n\nImage source: Google.\n\nGoogle plans to keep investing in Google Home\n\nGoogle plans to keep making Google Home a better device by improving its search capabilities and functionality. \"We are going to invest a lot in it over 2017,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai told investors on Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call. \"I think there is a lot of work ahead to make all of this work well for users. And this is the core area where we've invested in for the very long term,\" he added.\n\nGoogle intends to leverage its massive Android platform to continue improving Google Assistant, the artificial intelligence (AI) behind Google Home. At least 200 million devices will have access to the voice assistant, which will provide Google with a lot more opportunities to learn exactly what people are looking for when they say, \"OK, Google.\"\n\nGoogle will also have to improve Google Home's capabilities. The device currently has around 80 Actions, which is nothing compared to the 10,000-plus functionalities available with Alexa. To that end, Google launched the Actions on Google developer kit in December.\n\nStrategy Analytics estimates Google will sell 1 million Google Home devices by midyear. That still trails Amazon's sales by a significant margin. The research group estimates Amazon sold 6.3 million Echo devices last year, and that should go up meaningfully in 2017. Mahaney estimates Amazon will sell 60 million Echo devices by 2020, bringing the install base to 128 million.\n\nGoogle still doesn't know how to monetize voice search\n\nWhile Google Home sales are improving relative to Amazon Echo, it's not clear device sales will follow a similar path. Google Home lacks one of the key functionalities of Amazon's devices: the ability to easily shop on Amazon.\n\nSeventeen percent of Echo owners use Alexa to place orders on Amazon, according to Mahaney's survey. As the number of devices in use grows, Mahaney expects the amount of shopping done via Alexa on Amazon to grow as well. By 2020, sales through the voice assistant could reach $5 billion, according to the analyst's estimate.\n\nGoogle doesn't even have a business model for monetizing Google Home beyond hardware sales. Search and display ads don't work very well on a device with no display.\n\nMoreover, Google doesn't offer a compelling differentiating factor for consumers to pick its device over another smart speaker. Comparatively, Amazon Prime members, of which there's a rapidly growing number , have lots of reasons to pick the Echo, like easy access to ordering things on Amazon or inexpensive use of Amazon Music Unlimited.\n\nAs such, Amazon is poised to win the long-term competition even if Google Home is catching up in the short term.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The stock is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now but reported earnings after the close on Wednesday, March 15. The company posted revenues of $69.79M compared to the consensus of $63.95M. EPS of $0.19 was $0.06 better than the Wall Street consensus estimate.\n\nIn the release, the company guided Wall Street higher. FY2017 is now expected to produce revenue of between $322M to $325.5M and that is comfortably higher than the $300M consensus estimate. The company expects to earn $0.73 to $0.75 for the year and that is also above the $0.65 consensus estimate.\n\nIn late after hours trading, I see the stock at $33.39 up $2.76 or about 9%.\n\nEstimates Likely Moving Higher\n\nWhen a company raises guidance over the consensus you can expect the analysts to adjust their models. These models help them derive their earnings estimates which are used in the Zacks Rank. Since there haven't been any earnings revisions over the last 60 days, ALRM is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the coming days I anticipate the stock to see several upward revisions which should help boost the Zacks Rank for this stock to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nAcquisitions\n\nALRM made a few recent acquisitions and they were touched on during the conference call. During the call, management talked about how the ObjectVideo acquisition will allow customers to track cars and license plates or even customers in a store.\n\nThe Icontrol Networks deal closed in the quarter and the company mentioned how the Piper unit powers a portion of the ADT platform. The industry had been viewed as \"we versus ADT\" but that has changed with the advent of customer home protection services offered by cable companies.\n\nAn analyst questioned if the company was looking to a product offering around cars, and while the company would not commit on a specific answer, it was clear that it could be something coming down the road. Many times during the call management noted that they were maintaining a healthy level of spending for R&D. Having an expandable platform is key because the security business has been changing very rapidly.\n\nFollow Brian Bolan on Twitter @BBolan1\n\nOutlook\n\nAs we think about the changes in home security, it is clear that people are adding devices and services thanks to the relative ease of the internet. Management noted on the call that people want these products and services to come from one source.\n\nAs an example, I have a Google Cam (formerly Dropcam) and while it is accessible via its own app I would like to see it be usable via my Amazon echo. Yes the Google Nest is controllable via the voice recognizing tool, but I would like more functionality. I often search on Amazon for devices that are compatible with Alexa since I have power out that is controlled by another company. It too has its own app and with only a few devices having multiple apps is already a pressure point for me.\n\nWith the strong revenue guidance, management believes that its products and services will be well received by customers.\n\nAnalysts Notes Coming\n\nAs I look at where most recommendations are, I see a few potential upgrades tomorrow. Goldman Sachs started coverage of the stock with a Neutral rating on January 31 and a $31 price target. The analyst for the firm asked about the potential for organic growth from Icontrol which allowed management to talk about how they were going to hold their cost structure constant and could expect about $66M in EBITDA which translates to better than 20% margin. It is possible that Goldman Sachs ups the stock to \"Buy\" tomorrow.\n\nRaymond James downgraded the stock back on August 16 as the moved their rating to Market Perform from Outperform. Imperial Capital has the stock as \"In-line\" with a $30 price target.\n\nRoth Capital started coverage on October 3 with a buy and a $33.50 price target. Don't be surprised to see that price target moved to $37.50 range.\n\nMaxim Group initiated with a buy rating and $37 price target on December 1. They are clearly the most bullish on the stock and for good reason. I would look for the Maxim price target to expand to $40 or more given the recently posted results.\n\nTrading Range?\n\nThe stock has a 52 week high of $34.43, but don't be too surprised to see a new level reached tomorrow. Why do I say this? Well back on October 31, 2016 some unusual call buying was spotted in ALRM. The call was a $35 strike with a March expiration. At the time, the stock was $29 and change so it was a pretty big reach. I see those same calls closing at $0.17 with open interest of 856 - so not anything to get too excited about.\n\nWhat did catch my eye on the option chain was all the puts that moved the day of earnings. The 27.5 strike that expires on Friday saw 729 contracts vs open interest of 898. Check that open interest level tomorrow to see if those were all premium sellers as the put was paying $0.42.\n\nI like the chances of several price target increases coming tomorrow. There is an outside chance we get an upgrade on the stock as well. Throw in the idea that some mildly aggressive calls were bought several months ago I and I like the chances of this stock trading over $35 on March 16 or soon thereafter. Either way, look for this stock to become a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in a day or two.\n\nAlarm.com Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlarm.com Holdings, Inc.

Last year, the social network's sequential monthly active user growth stalled and even temporarily turned negative. Meanwhile, Twitter's revenue growth rates have decelerated rapidly and its stock price has plummeted nearly 70% in two years.\n\nGoing further, there isn't a clear end in sight to Twitter's revenue challenges. A new report by research company eMarketer (via Recode ) forecasts Twitter's U.S. mobile ad revenue will actually decline in 2017 compared to 2016 as Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google gobble up marketers' rising spending on mobile advertisements.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nTwitter's missed opportunity\n\nIn 2017, Twitter's U.S. mobile advertising revenue will decline from $1.21 billion last year to $1.15 billion, eMarketer estimates. A quick glance at Twitter's financials in the company's most recent quarter suggests this estimate is realistic. Twitter's $382 million in U.S. advertising revenue in Q4 was down 7% from the year-ago period. And given that 89% of Twitter's global ad revenue during the quarter came from mobile, it's safe to say that Twitter's mobile ad revenue in the U.S. probably isn't faring too well.\n\nWhat's unfortunate about Twitter's struggling mobile ad business in the U.S. is that it's happening at a time when marketers are spending more on mobile ads. Total mobile ad spend in the U.S. is expected to increase 25% in 2017 compared to 2016, eMarketer estimates.\n\nUnlike Twitter, advertising juggernauts Google and Facebook are well-positioned to snap-up this incremental spending. The two companies' combined share of U.S. mobile ad spend will increase from 54% in 2016 to 57% in 2017, eMarketer estimates. But eMarketer estimates that Twitter's share of U.S. mobile advertising revenue will decline from 2.6% in 2016 to 2% in 2017.\n\nTwitter management likely agrees that it won't be keeping up with Google's or Facebook's growth rate in 2017. In the company's fourth-quarter shareholder letter, management said, \"escalating competition for digital ad spending\" could present challenges for advertising revenue growth in 2017.\n\nImage source: Twitter.\n\nCan Twitter reinvigorate growth?\n\nLooking further into the future -- perhaps toward the end of 2017 and into 2018 -- Twitter's domestic advertising revenue could start growing again. Management believes that the company's recent reacceleration in user growth will drive revenue growth. But it's going to take time as management expects \"advertising revenue growth to continue to lag that of audience growth in 2017,\" the company explained in its fourth-quarter shareholder letter.\n\nBut if Twitter does return to mobile ad growth in the U.S. toward the end of the year or in 2018, don't expect growth rates to be very high. Not only may overall growth in U.S.-based mobile ad spend be much slower by then, but Twitter's anemic 3% year-over-year growth in U.S. monthly active users during the company's most recent quarter -- notably below Facebook's 5.5% year-over-year growth in U.S. monthly active users in the same period -- suggests the user growth won't be much help for Twitter in driving domestic ad revenue growth.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Twitter\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For the most part, Twilio stock has been trading in a tight range.\n\nSo might there be an opportunity? Perhaps TWLO stock has bottomed out and is poised for a move on the upside? Well, to see, let's take a look at three pros and three cons:\n\nThree Pros to Twilio Stock\n\nPowerful Platform : TWLO has a suite of powerful cloud-based applications, allowing for SMS, chat, voice calling and video. A developer can easily embed this technology into an app, providing access to a sophisticated communications network.\n\nThe business model is also enticing. That is, payments are only required when there is usage of the Twilio service.\n\nAs a result, the company has been able to quickly attract developers. Note that there are over 1 million accounts.\n\nGoing Upmarket : TWLO has an Enterprise Plan, which is focused on large customers that have tough requirements for compliance, security and administration. A key part of this was the recent granting of ISO 27001 certification, which is a global standard for security.\n\nWhile still in the early stages, the Enterprise Plan is showing encouraging results. For example, in the latest quarter TWLO snagged a major airline as well as Capital One Financial Corp . (NYSE: COF ) and the Blue Cross Blue Shield companies.\n\nAccording to CEO Jeff Lawson, on the most recent earnings call : \"We are seeing really good response in terms of the enterprise. Again, I would say this is our developer first model at play where developers are the ones bringing Twilio into the enterprise just like they've brought us into a number of different types of technology first companies.\"\n\nGrowth Opportunity : Companies like Uber, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) have raised the bar when it comes to apps and cloud technologies. Customers have come to expect that they can get quick service with just a few taps.\n\nThis is where TWLO is so powerful. The company's systems can easily allow for must-have features to remain competitive.\n\nSo in light of this, it should be no surprise that the market opportunity for Twilio stock is enormous. According to research from IDC , it's estimated at about $45.4 billion.\n\nThree Cons to Twilio Stock\n\nCompetition : It's certainly fierce. Just some of the rivals include Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Vonage Holdings Corp. (NYSE: VG ), CallFire, Nexmo and Bandwidth.com. In fact, some of TWLO's own customers could wind up being competitors, such as Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ). And telecom operators like AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) could leverage their own networks to take on TWLO.\n\nGranted, the low-price strategy of the company has probably been a key in maintaining marketshare. But then again, this may make it tough for it to ultimately get to profitability on a GAAP basis.\n\nCustomer Concentration : It is fairly heavy. Last year about 30% of revenues came from only 10 customers. Keep in mind that FB's WhatsApp represented 9% and Uber was over 10%. It's important to note that TWLO also generally allows customers to terminate their contracts at any time.\n\nNow this is not to say that these customers will suddenly bolt. Again, TWLO has continued to invest in R&D and to provide strong service.\n\nYet there are still risks. Let's face it, large companies can certainly leverage their power to exact better terms, especially when there are alternatives available.\n\nValuation : Even with the plunge in Twilio stock, the multiple is still at hefty levels. Note that the price-to-sales ratio is roughly 10X. Even for a fast-growing cloud company, this is steep.\n\nTake a look at some of the valuations in the industry:\n\nBottom Line on TWLO stock\n\n(NYSE: NEWR ) 8X(NYSE: BOX ) 5.3X(NASDAQ: APTI ) 3X\n\nTwilio definitely has a strong platform and it has continued to innovate it. Going forward, the company should benefit from the megatrends of cloud computing and mobile.\n\nBut for now, it's probably best not to take a position in TWLO stock as the valuation remains fairly high. Let's face it, there are cheaper alternatives available when it comes to fast-growing enterprise plays, such as NEWR, BOX or APTI.\n\nTom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbook and is the author of various books, including Taxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.

Consumers are spending much more time on social media sites like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) , Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) , Snap 's(NYSE: SNAP) Snapchat, and YouTube -- the subsidiary of Google, an Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company.\n\nBut if advertisers are going to replace television ads with digital ads, they'd prefer to buy them the same way they buy those old TV commercials. Twitter is happy to oblige. The company started offering guaranteed views for pre-roll video ads, and it's also letting marketers decide what content its ads run against, according to a report from AdAge .\n\nBack in July, former COO Adam Bain described Twitter's ability to attract television ad spend as a huge opportunity for the company. With Twitter's revenue expected to fall this year, Twitter needs to do everything it can to attract those budgets.\n\n\"The Starters\" is Twitter's first live show created as part of its deal with the NBA. Image source: Twitter.\n\nA bigger focus on video ads\n\nLast month, Twitter decided to reassess its direct response, promoted tweets, and TellApart products, and focus more intently on video ads. That's where Twitter sees the potential for its highest return on investment after slashing its marketing and sales personnel by 9% last fall.\n\nThe company has been growing the amount of video on its platform by integrating Periscope, partnering with major media companies, and shifting to an algorithmic-based timeline so it can push more videos into users' feeds. In the fourth quarter, Twitter streamed more than 600 hours of live premium video from content partners, attracting 31 million unique viewers. Deals with the NFL, NBA, Bloomberg, and others has opened up a lot of high-quality video ad inventory similar to television.\n\nBy offering guarantees on marketers hitting their target audiences, Twitter should be able to attract more TV ad budgets. Television networks also offer guarantees, and use extremely popular events to make good on them if they fail to hit the mark with the original ad run. Twitter has the advantage of more advanced targeting capabilities than television, which should enable it to dynamically insert ads based on users' profiles, and more easily make good on those guarantees.\n\nBut Twitter has a lot of competition\n\nTwitter isn't the only company competing for television ad budgets. Snap explicitly talks about the decline in television viewership among millennials, its primary demographic, as a massive opportunity for it to capitalize upon. Snapchat has several ad formats, and it's currently focusing on increasing the number of video ads it can show in users' stories, publisher's stories, and live stories.\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook is going after the television ad market by developing more video features on both its flagship app and Instagram. Facebook now has a dedicated video section within the app, and the company is seeding it with high-quality content. It's been testing mid-roll ads to grab more ad revenue as it faces saturation of its regular newsfeed ads.\n\nYouTube has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of shifting ad budgets, and now it's looking to prove its worth with literal TV ads. The impending launch of YouTube TV will provide a few ad slots per hour for YouTube to fill in its over-the-top streaming TV service. If YouTube can prove results better than regular television commercials, it may attract more ad spend to its main platform, as well.\n\nCan Twitter take the pressure?\n\nWith a growing number of options for marketers to buy high-quality digital video ads, Twitter has to do what it can to stand out from the crowd. It's notably outsized by both Facebook and YouTube, and Snapchat boasts much better engagement and the demographics marketers look for.\n\nOffering guarantees, and more say on what kind of content ads are paired with, is a good start, but those offers are easily replicated. YouTube, for example, already offers the option to buy into Google Preferred, which lets advertisers select specific packages of the most popular YouTube channels. If the guarantees make a big difference in buying trends, don't expect Twitter's victory to last long, as Google and Facebook quickly jump on board with their own guarantees.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Twitter\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Competition has the tendency to drive down profits, but a great business can buck this trend. A competitive advantage isn't enough; the best businesses have durable competitive advantages, what Warren Buffett calls an economic moat. Trying to beat a company with a moat isn't impossible, but it's often not worth the cost.\n\nWe asked three of our contributors to each discuss a company that fits the above description. Here's why Mastercard (NYSE: MA) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , and Waste Management (NYSE: WM) are three of the best businesses, and the best stocks, we've ever seen.\n\nA toll bridge on global commerce\n\nBrian Feroldi (Mastercard): While there are a lot of great business models in existence, I must admit that Mastercard's is the one I most admire. Mastercard plays a crucial role in connecting merchants, customers, and financial institutions together to enable digital commerce. In exchange for its services, Mastercard takes a small swipe off of each transaction. With trillions of dollars flowing through its network each year -- yes, trillions -- those small fees add up to the tune of more than $10 billion in annual revenue.\n\nAll that revenue is wonderful, but what I really love about Mastercard's business is its operating leverage. In essence, this means that Mastercard's costs are largely fixed, so processing one more transaction costs the company next to nothing. Thus, every additional transaction that the company can incentivize on its network almost turns into pure profit. Since consumers have been ditching cash and checks in favor of credit and debit cards for years, Mastercard's profit margin has skyrocketed.\n\nMA Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts .\n\nLooking ahead, I see no reason for this trend to change. While credit and debit cards are ubiquitous in developed markets, they only represent 15% of global transactions. That suggests that this company has decades of room left for revenue and profit growth. If true, then Mastercard's stock stands a good chance at continuing to thump the market from here. That's why I've made this company one of my biggest personal holdings and have no intention to sell my shares anytime soon.\n\nAn incredible technology company\n\nTim Green (Alphabet): The amount of cash that Alphabet's Google throws off is made even more impressive by the fact that the company is still growing at a double-digit rate. Revenue from Google grew by 20% in 2016 to $89.5 billion, with the business producing operating income of $27.9 billion. While Google does face threats, ranging from social media companies like Facebook to e-commerce giant Amazon , the company's products are so deeply embedded in people's lives that upending its business model would be a herculean task.\n\nGoogle dominates search, leaving its competitors fighting over the scraps. Products like Gmail, Maps, and the Chrome browser have become the standards, giving Google a massive base of users. Google's Android mobile operating system powers more than 85% of all smartphones sold, and its Chromebooks now account for more than half of all U.S. classroom devices sold. All of this feeds into it advertising business and its cloud computing business.\n\nImage source: Alphabet.\n\nThe success of Google allows Alphabet to subsidize its moon shots. From self-driving cars to internet access delivered via balloons, Alphabet is betting billions that one of these long-shot ideas will take off. Many will lead nowhere, but the potential of each idea is enormous.\n\nAlphabet is one of the most successful companies in history, and that success has been sustained by significant competitive advantages. Even if none of Alphabet's moonshots pay off, the company should continue to thrive well into the future.\n\nThe best kind of business: The ones you use daily but never even consider\n\n\n\nTyler Crowe (Waste Management): I think of some of the best businesses to be in are the ones that we don't consider on a daily basis. Those day-to-day tasks we take for granted and think nothing of paying for the service. Is there anything that fits that description better than handling our refuse? Companies that collect and properly dispose of our trash are incredibly valuable services that we barely notice. Behind the scenes, though, it is a business that has more competitive advantages than one can count. That's what makes Waste Management the kind of company that leaves me in awe of its business model.\n\nThe most obvious advantage a waste handling industry has is geography and regulations. The ability to open up a new landfill for proper waste disposal faces mountains of regulatory scrutiny as well as the \"not in my backyard\" mentality of local communities. So those companies that can get a landfill up and running have near-monopolistic reign over a particular region. If that weren't enough, it's extremely capital intense to build and maintain a fleet of collection vehicles. These types of strategic benefits keep competition low in specific regions and give those operating in a particular community incredible pricing power.\n\nFor investors in Waste Management, it has translated this economic moat into a value-generating machine. While no one will ever be blown away with the company's growth rates, it continues to generate gobs of free cash flow that is used to buy back stock and increase dividend payments. These sorts of shareholder-friendly initiatives have made Waste Management an incredible stock to hold for decades at a time.\n\nWM Dividend data by YCharts .\n\nIt's hard to disrupt a well-entrenched business in the waste-handling industry, and that makes Waste Management a stock that should tug at the heartstrings of long-term investors.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Mastercard\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

With all the hype, investors may be asking themselves: What's the best way to invest in this growing trend?\n\nLet's look at three companies with solid artificial-intelligence programs: e-commerce titan Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Google search parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , and cognitive-computing leader International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM) .\n\nAmazon's Echo smart-home speaker, powered by AI-based Alexa. Image source: Amazon, Inc.\n\nAmazon.com\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos believes that AI could be the fourth pillar of the company's business, behind its e-commerce, its cloud hosting unit Amazon Web Services (AWS), and its Prime membership program. Alexa, the company's virtual assistant and AI poster child, hosts a variety of products that leverage her AI foundation, including the Echo smart-home speaker , the smaller Dot, and the portable Tap, as well as the Fire tablet and Fire TV Stick. Using natural-language processing and cloud computing, these products respond to voice commands, and AI allows Alexa to learn continuously the more the products are used. Developers have created more than 10,000 \"skills\" that provide a variety of functionality, from ordering pizza to scheduling a ride-share.\n\nAmazon has also been leveraging its deep-learning innovations by deploying them across AWS as managed services available to its customers. Lex, similar to Alexa, can build sophisticated chatbots; Rekognition provides image-recognition capabilities; and Polly reads and recites text. Amazon grew its revenue to $46 billion in its most recent quarter, so its AI contribution is currently microscopic, but that could change. RBC Capital Markets predicts that Alexa could contribute an additional $10 billion annually by 2020.\n\nGoogle Home smart speaker system. Image source: Google.\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle has been investing heavily for years in a sub-discipline of AI called deep learning , and the result of that research is an artificial neural network, christened the Google Brain. By combining massive amounts of data with complicated algorithms, the system recognizes patterns and learns in a way similar to the human brain. The company has infused the knowledge gained into a vast array of its businesses, using AI to improve the reliability of its ubiquitous search, decrease the energy consumption of its servers, and catalog images from its Street View mapping cars.\n\nIts AI-powered Google Assistant, the company's entry in the growing list of virtual personal assistants , is available in many of the company's branded devices and is the foundation for its Google Home smart speaker system. Google Assistant interacts with the company's Photos, Maps, Keep, Calendar, and other services, provides the ability to stream music and movies to Android mobile devices, and controls home-automation products. Google is also a well-known pioneer in the area of AI-based autonomous driving.\n\nWith $26 billion in revenue for the most recent quarter, Alphabet will notice little effect from Home just yet; this is a new product, so we don't have data for how popular it is, but the potential market is huge. Activate.com estimates that smart speakers will be in 21 million homes by 2020.\n\nWatson employs advanced analytics to \"see\" medical images. Image source: IBM.\n\nIBM\n\nIBM's Watson might be best remembered for its winning stint on the popular TV game show Jeopardy! , but Watson hasn't been resting on its laurels. You won't see consumer-facing products coming from Big Blue, but the company has developed a wide variety of business partnerships using the abilities of its cognitive AI supercomputer. Watson's earliest foray was into the field of healthcare, where it has been tasked with cancer research, immunotherapy, diabetes management, and genomic sequencing. Most notably, Watson was recently able to correctly diagnose cancer patients, agreeing with oncologists in 99% of cases. The cognitive computer also successfully diagnosed a rare form of leukemia in a case that had baffled doctors -- all within 10 minutes after being fed the data.\n\nWatson has partnered in other fields, improving the accuracy of tax returns , providing cybersecurity , and improving regulatory compliance for financial institutions. Watson is a bet on AI-based cognitive computing, data analytics, and cloud computing, as the company moves away from its legacy hardware and IT services business. IBM has yet to disclose Watson's contribution, but \"strategic imperatives,\" where Watson's revenue is reported, grew 13% in 2016 to account for 41% of total revenue.\n\nFoolish final thoughts\n\nThese companies are at the forefront of the AI revolution, but AI innovations represent only a portion of their total business. Investors should avoid investing in any of these companies based solely on the advantages represented by AI.\n\nThat said, if you like any of these companies and are interested in adding AI to your portfolio, each offers that opportunity. While it may be difficult to quantify many of the benefits, we do know that AI can help increase revenue and efficiency, provide a compelling and productive ecosystem to consumers, and provide new opportunities for business.\n\n10 stocks we like better than IBM\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Only three years old, Workflow founders and investors received what TechCrunch called \"a solid payday.” We don’t know what that means given that terms of the deal were not disclosed. However, what we do know is that Workflow, whose motto is \"spend less taps, get more done,” is one of the most-popular apps on Apple’s App Store.\n\nFor only $2.99, Workflow connects apps and functions that allows users to automate the things they do most often on their Apple devices. For example, by generating shortcuts and placing the corresponding icons on their home screen, users can request an Uber just from a single tap, using a preset location. Likewise, with one tap, Workflow users can receive the top news stories from the day or order a Starbucks (SBUX) latte without opening the Starbucks app.\n\nThere are several reasons why Apple bought Workflow, which awarded Workflow with an Apple Design award at its annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 2015. Workflow, which is also available on Apple Watch, has been praised by Apple for features such as VoiceOver and and drag/drop. But given the rapid rise and dominance of Amazon’s (AMZN) home speaker, combined with Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google Home, Apple can now integrate Workflow with its voice-activated assistant Siri.\n\nLikewise, Apple CEO Tim Cook has shown tons of interest in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI). Workflow’s ability to make different apps talk to each other could be the missing piece Apple has been seeking to fully immerse itself into HomeKit. And the fact that Apple has already made Workflow free on Apple devices, removing the previous $2.99 price, suggests Apple is serious about ramping up the number of people who uses the app.\n\nAll told, this move also underscores the extent to which Apple is aggressively looking to grow its Services segment, which accounted for 9.2% of total revenue in the first quarter.

Last season, Twitter paid $10 million for the same rights.\n\nAlthough, its not clear how much the winning bidder will have to pay this year, it's likely to be far less than the $450 millionCBS Corp. and NBCUniversal are collectively paying to broadcast the same 10 games.\n\nTwitter had claimed that around 3.5 million people watched each game, on average.\n\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\n\nhttp://www.rttnews.com\n\nThis article appears in: Politics , World Markets , Stocks", "Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is already a dominant force in digital display advertising. eMarkter expects the social network giant's share of the U.S. market to climb to 39.1% this year, as it sells more than three times as much display advertising as its next closest competitor, Google. The Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company is expected to generate $5.2 billion in U.S. display advertising this year.\n\nBut Facebook's ad revenue is largely confined to its own properties, such as Facebook and Instagram. The Facebook Audience Network (FAN) -- its ad network -- generates only a few hundred million in annual net ad revenue for the company. That number could get a significant boost in the near term, as Facebook just announced it's rolling out header bidding to all mobile web publishers. That represents not only a significant opportunity for Facebook to increase its network ad revenue, but a threat to Google's display ad business as well.\n\nImage source: Facebook\n\nPublishers love header bidding\n\nHeader bidding is a system that levels the playing field when it comes to selling ads online. Previously, whenever you loaded a web page, that publisher would check ad networks one by one until it found an advertiser willing to pay a reasonable price to populate the ads on the site. Since Google is such a dominant force in advertising, publishers' searches usually started and ended with Google.\n\nHeader bidding allows publishers to collect bids from multiple ad networks at the same time and receive the highest bid for its ad inventory. As a result, publishers receive more revenue for their ads, and smaller ad networks stand a fighting chance against Google. The more ad networks supporting header bidding, the better it is for publishers. Facebook says publishers in its tests saw a revenue increase of 10% to 30%.\n\nImage source: Facebook\n\nAmazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) notably developed a header bidding solution last year in an effort to potentially grow its advertising business . Given Amazon's prowess in cloud computing -- supporting hundreds of major websites -- its integrated cloud-based solution could prove extremely popular with publishers. Now, Facebook is partnering with Amazon and several other header-bidding system developers to bring its ad network to more publishers.\n\nGrowing the ad network\n\nFacebook's audience network still represents a small part of Facebook's revenue. It reached a $1 billion run rate at the beginning of 2016, but that's gross revenue. Facebook only keeps a small percentage of that figure as net revenue.\n\nDuring Facebook's second-quarter earnings call last year, CFO Dave Wehner told analysts: \"The overall growth is still being driven predominantly by Facebook. Instagram is clearly making a contribution, as is the Audience Network.\"\n\nThat may change later this year, however, as Facebook faces ad load saturation. But with the social network's steady user growth and continued increases in engagement, Facebook's enormousness will still be tough to overshadow.\n\nNonetheless, the growth of FAN will certainly help Facebook offset some of the slowdown at its flagship app. In fact, since the audience network uses the same targeting data as Facebook's in-house ads, Facebook advertisers may be inclined to start buying more ads on Facebook, especially if header bidding increases its ability to win bids on publishers' websites.\n\nFAN represents an opportunity for marketers to reach Facebook's audience outside Facebook and even expand beyond Facebook. Management says FAN offers 16% greater reach than Facebook alone and now reaches 1 billion people monthly.\n\nThe impact on Google\n\nThe value of FAN to publishers is that Facebook requires marketers to bid the same on FAN ads as on its own ads. Therefore, third-party publishers get the same (presumably high) rates as Facebook. If Facebook's average bid is higher than Google's, it could force Google to lower its take rate from publishers.\n\nLast year, Google generated $15.6 billion in gross revenue from its network partners. It also paid out $10.9 billion in revenue sharing to those publishers, about 70%. In fact, publishers' revenue share from Google has increased two percentage points since 2014, when header bidding started becoming popular.\n\nGoogle said that \"the increase in Network Members' TAC [traffic acquisition cost] rate was primarily driven by the shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying.\" As more ad sales shift to header bidding and more ad networks like Facebook join the fray, Google stands to see that number continue climbing, unless it wants to lose out on some of that $15.6 billion in gross revenue it generated last year.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Facebook\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But is it time to buy GOOGL stock's pullback? Let's take a look at what's behind the price action, the technical picture and a limited-risk options strategy on Alphabet to better navigate the environment.\n\nSource: Travis Wise via Flickr\n\nThe consensus view earlier this year had been any political risks facing Alphabet would surely be coming out of China or from Capitol Hill. But it was a problem from across the pond and from our European neighbors in the U.K. that sent shares of GOOGL tumbling this week.\n\nFor the weekly period, shares of Alphabet are off about 4% after influential foreign ad buyers lashed out about how their ads had been placed alongside terrorist and other extremism media on Google's YouTube. For its part, Alphabet is taking action and looking to improve its \"brand safety controls.\"\n\nImprovements aren't happening soon enough for some though. Earlier this week, as Barron's noted, France's Havas SA , the world's sixth largest marketing agency, stated it had pulled the plug on all client advertising in the U.K. from both YouTube and the Google Display Network.\n\nAnd now American companies are joining the ranks in protest as well.\n\nIn the interim and while the controversy plays out with bulls like Pacific Crest and bears, or at least alarmists , chiming in, we can take a visual look at how things are playing out in GOOGL stock.\n\nGOOGL Stock Daily Chart\n\nJust prior to this week's sudden and volatile bout of profit-taking, GOOGL stock had been making all the right technical moves. Since the beginning of 2017, shares of Alphabet managed to successfully clear the prior all-time highs, rally, establish a successful test of support and then proceed to even higher highs.\n\nNow - despite the quick drop of around 4% this week - our view is Alphabet could be setting up as a pullback entry. For the more quick-fingered among us, the hammering of shares by Thursday's close actually formed a bullish hammer low.\n\nThe reversal pattern has some backing from an oversold stochastics condition and received price confirmation early Friday as GOOGL stock moved above the candlestick's high of $841.69.\n\nIs it perfect? No. There has been some distribution, the current setup is modestly below the well-watched 50-day simple moving average and trends do eventually end.\n\nPersonally and given the mixed evidence, I'd rather look at entering into GOOGL stock if it were to trade down into a support zone from around $795 - $825. The potential area of support holds a couple retracement levels, the 200-day simple moving average and a second test of the prior highs, and amounts to a correction of up to 9% within the bigger picture's established uptrend.\n\nGOOGL Long Put Butterfly\n\nGiven my belief that the hammering may not be completely done in Alphabet, I like the idea of an atypical approach to positioning for downside and buying stock at lower levels.\n\nWith GOOGL near $840, the April $835/$820/$805 is priced for $2.20 or better. The bearishly targeted butterfly achieves its maximum profit of $12.80 if shares fall 2.5% to $820 on expiration. More achievable, the limited risk spread maintains a profit range from $807.20 to $832.80 and prior to that third Friday, gains can even be realized outside the targeted price zone.\n\nIf GOOGL stock actually begins to rally in a material way, I would personally look to cut risk using a money stop of 50%, or $1.10. While the initial debit is small, holding on and remaining on the wrong side of price action in a name the trader ultimately wants to own at lower prices doesn't make sense.\n\nWere shares of Alphabet to fall below $805, the trader will be out the full debit. However, if the end game is buying GOOGL on weakness as it enters the support zone, knowing the most you'd pay for the stock is $807.20 and possibly a lot less, is worth considering.\n\nInvestment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) has a hit on its hands with its artificial intelligence -based Alexa virtual assistant and the products powered by the digital darling. The Echo smart home speaker, its miniature sibling the Dot, and the portable Tap have taken the world by storm. Alexa was the hit of the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, and its family of products, which also includes the Fire TV stick and Fire tablet, were top sellers on Amazon.com during the 2016 holiday season.\n\nIf Alexa suffers from one key disadvantage, it's the lack of a smartphone to call home . Apple 's(NASDAQ: AAPL) Siri resides on the iPhone, and Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google Assistant lives on the company's Android ecosystem. With opposing virtual assistants taking up residence on hundreds of millions of phones worldwide, how would Alexa ever compete? Several recent developments are making this disadvantage less of an issue.\n\nJust one Amazon product powered by Alexa. Image source: Amazon.\n\nCall me\n\nRecode is reporting that Amazon is planning upgrades that would allow Alexa-powered devices to initiate phone calls using voice commands. This new communication functionality would extend to other Alexa devices, working in much the same way as an intercom. If true, this capability would partially address the disadvantage compared to other digital assistants, which are primarily smartphone-based.\n\nAmazon is taking other steps to counter its virtual assistant's marked deficiency. Amazon reveled this week that Alexa would soon be found in Amazon's official iPhone app, already one of the more popular downloads in Apple's app store. Users will be able to tap the microphone button inside the Amazon app to access Alexa, which essentially brings its myriad of skills to the iPhone. And it won't be the only phone sporting Alexa. Earlier this year, Chinese phone giant Huawei revealed that its Mate 9 phone would be the \"First smartphone with Amazon Alexa.\" With these recent announcements, it probably won't be long before Alexa is available on Google's Android phones.\n\nAlexa gets an upgrade. Image source: Amazon.\n\nIn my house\n\nEstimates for sales of the Alexa family of products vary. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) estimates that 8.2 million US consumers own an Alexa-powered device. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated total sales at 11 million by early December 2016, but admit that number is too low, having missed out on the high-volume Black Friday and holiday sales. Including strong holiday sales, those numbers could be in the range of 13 to 15 million. With an estimated 125 million U.S. households, Alexa could be nearing a 10% penetration rate.\n\nWhat have you done for me lately?\n\nAlexa's popularity seems to stem from more than the mere novelty of the product. Amazon released a skills kit early on that encouraged developers to create voice commands, which connected Alexa to their products and services. Amazon recently announced that developers had published more than 10,000 skills for the virtual assistant, giving it the clear lead in terms of usefulness. With that many choices, you might wonder how to find the skills most useful to you. Alexa has that covered, with a Skill Finder feature that also presents a \"skill of the day\" for the asking. Other popular offerings include games like the Potterhead quiz for Harry Potter fans, trainer tips for fans of Pokemon Go , ordering your favorite Domino's pizza, and even help deciding what to watch on TV or at the movies.\n\nFoolish final thoughts\n\nAddressing the key disadvantage that stood between Alexa and consumers is an indication of how seriously the company views its ecosystem. The family of products have even been prominently displayed in Amazon's growing number of bookstores. Early sales won't make a dent in Amazon's revenue, a gargantuan $44 billion in the company's most recent quarter, so why the big push? A recent analyst note may provide a clue. Mark Mahaney and Jim Shaughnessy from RBC Capital Markets predict that it could be worth an additional $10 billion in annual sales of devices and products by 2020. With that much riding on Alexa, it's no wonder that Amazon would go to such lengths to up its game.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But despite major initiatives by megacorporations Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) , and others, there are major road blocks ahead for the driverless car revolution. A recent McKinsey report highlights five of them.\n\n1. Pricing\n\nNo matter how incredible an innovation might be, it's useless if it's not affordable. Although Alphabet's Waymo has clocked more than 2 million road miles in its autonomous vehicles, McKinsey estimates that self-driving cars are \"unlikely to be available before 2020.\" Alphabet and others are inching closer to commercializing their products. A partnership with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE: FCAU) will, for the first time, take Alphabet's autonomous driving technology out of its peculiar \"panda car\" and into 100 Pacifica Hybrid minivans in early 2017. But those minivans aren't for sale, and, if they were, would probably cost magnitudes more than an average minivan.\n\n2. Consumer Understanding\n\nVideo source: Waymo via YouTube\n\nEven if driverless cars become affordable, no one will buy them if they don't understand them. That means that self-driving car companies need to educate consumers on the advantages of autonomous vehicles. Informational videos like the one above produced by Alphabet's Waymo are an important start, and others like Tesla Motors are producing their own video vignettes to make self-driving cars salient. Tesla Motors and others have a clear business incentive to make self-driving seem mainstream, and the more that their message is spread, the brighter the future for their sales and sustainability.\n\n3. Safety/Security issues\n\nConsumer understanding goes hand in hand with a major concern about autonomous technology -- safety and security. At no point was this clearer than in May 2016, when Tesla Motors reported the first driver fatality while its Autopilot technology was engaged. The tragic crash occurred when neither the driver nor Tesla Motors' technology recognized a truck's white-colored trailer crossing its path on a highway. There will certainly be more tragedies in the future of autonomous vehicles, and it will remain a continuing challenge and the highest priority for self-driving car companies to minimize safety and security issues. However, it's also important to remember that these high-profile cases can cause over-reactions, and sticking to statistics can help investors, companies, and consumers alike identify the best autonomous option for investing, manufacturing, and purchasing.\n\n4 & 5: Regulation and Technology\n\nAs with all new innovations, regulation and technology can make or break a revolution. The McKinsey report is quick to note that regulation is a hurdle, rather than a never-ending issue. It makes sense, then, that Ford, Alphabet, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo Cars have all joined together to create the \" Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets .\" Rather than rally for \"wild west\" free market competition, these companies want to see a sensible framework of standardized regulation upon which they can confidently build their new business units.\n\nTechnology isn't a hurdle, but there is a minimum threshold below which driverless cars will never be the norm. Companies like Alphabet's Waymo and Tesla Motors are aiming for full autonomy, while others are taking the more step-wise approach of offering semi-autonomous additions like Audi's \"Traffic Jam Assist.\" The McKinsey report estimates that, once regulation and technology issues have been resolved, \"up to 15 percent of new cars sold in 2030 could be fully autonomous.\"\n\nHit the brakes?\n\nImage Source: Getty Images.\n\n2017 will not be the year self-driving cars take over our roads. Pricing, consumer understanding, safety/security, regulation, and technology issues will continue to impede this industry's revolution. But Alphabet, Tesla Motors, and others are making steady gains on addressing these issues, and the ultimate widespread adoption of autonomous technology is almost inarguable. Forward-looking investors with long-term horizons should acknowledge these issues, select their self-driving stocks accordingly, and sit back to enjoy this multi-year market road trip.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While it makes sense for companies like Apple and Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) to pour money into moonshot technology projects, it's a bit more of a confusing move for Snap to make.\n\nIn this clip from Industry Focus: Tech , tech sector bureau chief Dylan Lewis and contributor Evan Niu talk about what Snap might possibly want from their investment in drones, a few reasons why putting so much money and time into drones is probably ill-advised, and more.\n\nA full transcript follows the video.\n\n10 stocks we like better than GoPro\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.*\n\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and GoPro wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\n\nClick here to learn about these picks!\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017\n\n\n\nThis podcast was recorded on March 3, 2017.\n\nDylan Lewis: The next piece of news we're going to talk about is even more bizarre. According to reports from The New York Times , the company had other hardware ambitions, namely drones. At the moment, details are scarce, but several anonymous sources at the company confirmed Snap has been pursuing a drone camera project. I guess the thought here is, drones would allow aerial Snaps, it would allow people to capture video and images in a more novel way and a cool landscape way. Again, this seems kind of crazy to me, for this to be the focus.\n\nEvan Niu: [laughs] Yeah. It makes no sense to me. As ridiculous as the Spectacle thing is, trying to brand a company around those, the drone thing also makes no sense to me. It's hard to imagine someone buying a drone. First of all, it's hard to imagine Snap coming out with a drone that is competitive with what's already out there from DJI and even GoPro . Look at even GoPro trying to get into drones -- they've had a lot of trouble. A company like GoPro that had experience making cameras still has trouble making a really compelling drone that has all the full features that people expect nowadays.\n\nLewis: They famously had to recall one of their products, because they were having trouble with it.\n\nNiu: Yeah, because the battery was loose. If you shook it, the battery would move by a millimeter and the contacts would lose power, which is a really simple and kind of embarrassing problem. It was such a silly little mistake, and it probably had something to do with their manufacturing or something, I don't know. But yeah, the point being, GoPro hasn't really pulled off the drone thing very well either. And they were probably much better-positioned to make that kind of jump in the first place. And, of course, this is just a report that they're working on. Who knows if they actually do it. I hope they realize that it's a bad idea, and probably save everyone a bunch of headaches if they just don't do it at all. I mean, I guess it's not surprising that they have looked into it, since they want to become a camera company. But whether or not they actually do it, I think the chances are probably against it. I would hope so.\n\nLewis: Yeah. I get that, it's tempting to be a tech company and have these really sexy side project. You see the stuff that Alphabet has done with Google's self-driving cars. That is so far afield from their core search property. Even getting into virtual reality on the hardware side with Oculus. But, you look at those two companies, those are businesses that have a cash cow underlying all of these futuristic R&D projects. Their core platforms, their ad-selling platforms are doing wonders for them, and are allowing them to throw money off on the side, and see what happens with these more futuristic, hard-to-pin-down-what-the-impact-might-be type projects. I think with Snap right now, there's a little bit of a focus concern on my end, because you haven't really figured out your core platform yet, you haven't monetized it really well. You're still rolling ads into it and building it into the user experience. And, you have like 3% quarter-to-quarter user growth. You have so many issues with what should be your core focus, I'm not really sure why they're doubling down on their hardware initiatives, if this is something they're really spending a lot of time on.\n\nNiu: That's a good point, I agree completely. Why aren't they focusing on getting the core business up and running in a good way? They're just now really rolling out these ads. Of course, in advertising, your ability to target ads is really critical in delivering value to your advertisers, who are the actual customers. That's who pays you. Facebook does a really good job with ad targeting because they have so much of your data. Twitter , I think, has had some troubles, which is partially why they're not monetizing as well as they should be. So, I guess the question is, how much user data can Snap really get, and how valuable will that be? Most of the stuff you're putting on Snapchat disappears immediately. What kind of data can they gather that's going to be really useful to turn around and use for targeting? It's kind of the same thing with Twitter. A lot of times, people can view tweets publicly without having to sign in, which limits Twitter's ability to gather data on them, which is also why it's harder for them to monetize their users. It's a big question on execution going forward, how they can really grow this ad business. If they can, this will do well. They are very new to this.\n\nLewis: Yeah, it's something that I think they really have to figure out still. You look at the data points that Facebook and Google have on their users, and you're right, it's totally different, the profile is so robust for what people have on their Facebook. They know all my interests, they know everything I like, and they're able to incorporate that into the algorithms they're using to feed stuff up to me. Google knows exactly what you're searching for, and can serve up hyper-relevant stuff. With Snap, they know your friends, they know your demographic, and maybe they know some of the outlets that you're typically interested in on the story side. But I think they still need to do a ton to figure that out, and I'd rather see them doubling down there than going further afield with some of these hardware projects.\n\nNiu: Yeah. The big emphasis on hardware in general is confounding to me. I don't understand why they're doing it, or why they're trying to make this pivot -- if you want to call it a pivot. They should just get down to working on their actual ad platform, focus on the software-as-a-service stuff, before they really start dabbling in this hardware stuff. Hardware is hard.\n\nLewis: And the way that their hardware is set up, too, their Spectacles are built-in to integrate with Snapchat. They're not really a device that you can use across platforms.\n\nNiu: Well, you can export, and it exports in a circular format as opposed to the square format that most people see. So, there is a way that you can export content that you take on Spectacles. But, yeah, the point is, you would think they would want to tie exclusively to the platform. But then, it's like, why would you buy some product that's only available for this platform? Conversely, if it's not a good product, if it works on all platforms, why would you buy it unless it's the best product out there? It's this really weird Catch 22. Imagine, would you buy a product that could only submit stuff to Facebook? It doesn't make any sense. But that would be the differentiating factor. But yeah, their whole strategy makes no sense to me.\n\nLewis: Yeah, it seems a little backwards. The point that I was going to make is just, the biggest salesman for the hardware stuff is going to be people being on the platform in general. The addressable market for those products is going to be whatever the user base that they have is. Right now, it's around 160 million daily active users. The most compelling way to make that hardware business look appetizing is to continue to grow that user base, then maybe you have people that want something that's a little bit more dedicated. I'm still skeptical of that. But ultimately, that logic ties back to, build the platform out and grow the user base, and worry about hardware second, right?\n\nNiu: Yeah, I agree.\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

(NASDAQ: AMD ) shareholders. AMD stock, after more than quintupling over the course of the prior 12 months, fell 16% in just four days a week ago and has struggled to pick itself up off the mat in the meantime.\n\nSource: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr\n\nThe prod for the pullback? Reports that its new (and well-hyped) computer processor wasn't performing quite as well as expected once put to the test in real-world applications. As Ars Technica reviewer Mark Walton put it :\n\n\"The [Ryzen] 1800X lags behind its Intel counterparts in gaming, regardless of whether it's running at the same clock speed or higher.\"\n\nIt was a real blow to optimistic investors, who had bid AMD stock up in a big way on hopes that the new CPU would be the centerpiece of a turnaround story. Now that story is in question.\n\nThing is, the Ryzen may not be as central to the company's rebound as it's been made it to be. Indeed, Advanced Micro Devices has a lot more going for it besides the new CPU that investors aren't giving it credit for. Three specific items come to mind. Note than a handful of AMD's competitors are now becoming partners.\n\n3 Things AMD Still Has Going For It\n\nWhile investors had high expectations for Ryzen, the future for Advanced Micro Devices isn't dependent on it. In fact, there are three other areas that may end up meaning even more for its top and bottom lines.\n\nIn no particular order …\n\nPenetrating the Cloud Market: While AMD has always had a presence in most key tech markets, cloud computing was never a key one for the company. That's changing now though… a ball that got rolling just in the past few weeks. In November, Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google division tapped AMD, looking to add its graphical processor units to Google's machine learning architecture .\n\nIt's a curious development, as GPU chips weren't designed to do anything more than handle a computer's display screen. As it turns out, though, its GPUs are very capable of parallel computing, which is a critical aspect of this new cloud-based function.\n\nIn the meantime, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) selected AMD processors to power its next-generation open course cloud platform.\n\nAt stake is a piece of the cloud infrastructure market worth an estimated $300 billion per year.\n\nMore Licensing Revenue: It's only an unconfirmed rumor thus far, but a reasonably credible one. That is, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) is reportedly interested in using AMDs Radeon graphics technology to power Intel's integrated GPUs in future computers … displacing Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ). The agreement between Nvidia and Intel ends at the end of March.\n\nAt the very least, the prospect of such an IP licensing deal could mean a couple hundred million dollars in annual high-margin revenue. If Intel really wants to step up its game, though, it could help fund improvements in the way its CPUs handle graphics.\n\nNew GPUs Will Enhance New CPU Revenue: While the reviews for the new Ryzen processor have been mixed, AMD stock holders should bear in mind that they're only half the next generation of hardware for Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nThe other half of the one-two punch combination for AMD this year is the new Vega GPU, which should be unveiled around the middle of this year. As was noted back on Feb. 7 :\n\n\"Vega, is a second-generation high bandwidth memory (or HBM2) design found on a stacked-memory architecture that performs significantly better than the more common GDDR5 (double data rate type-five) utilized by most graphics processing units today. An essentially-infinite amount of memory can be dedicated to handling the display - the maximum virtualization is capped at a ridiculous 512 terabytes. This platform is about twice as powerful as most current alternatives, and will make Advanced Micro Devices competitive with the newest generation of GPU architecture from Nvidia, called Pascal.\"\n\nMore important, Vega was largely built with the Ryzen processor in mend, with each getting the most performance out of one another.\n\nIn the meantime, it's not like the Ryzen CPU is a lost cause. As the company's CEO Lisa Su recently explained , \"We hear people on wanting to see improved 1080p performance and we fully expect that Ryzen performance in 1080p will only get better as developers get more time with 'Zen.' We have over 300+ developers now working with 'Zen' and several of the developers for Ashes of Singularity and Total [War:] Warhammer are actively optimizing now.\"\n\nBottom Line for AMD Stock\n\nAs encouraging as the future may be for the company whether or not Ryzen ends up performing well, there's still no denying that AMD stock is overbought and ripe for some profit-taking; that 16% dip is nothing compared to 2016's huge rally.\n\nBut don't confuse any future weakness from AMD as evidence of what's in store, results-wise, from the company. Advanced Micro Devices is very well positioned for a great 2017. The trick is just being patient enough to wait for a truly palatable entry price. That could still be well below the recent low.\n\nIn other words, you don't want to step into AMD stock for the long haul until it's almost uncomfortable to do so. We aren't there yet.\n\nAs of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Their argument is that one of the criteria for inclusion in the indexes is \"a corporate governance structure consistent with U.S. practice.\" Snap's corporate structure is quite unusual, with the founders holding about 90% of the voting rights, and average investors holding no votes at all.\n\nExcluding Snap shares from the S&P 500 may not sound like a big deal -- it doesn't affect the underlying fundamentals of the company. But the growing popularity of index funds and ETFs means Snap will miss out on billions of dollars of buyer support that early investors may have been expecting down the road.\n\nImage source: Spectacles.com.\n\n$6 trillion and growing\n\nIndex funds and ETFs are expected to overtake actively managed investments in the next seven years or so, according to Moody's. Currently, investors have plowed $6 trillion in assets into the passive investments. $2 trillion of those assets track the S&P 500 index.\n\nGetting added to the S&P 500 is a big deal. When Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was added to the S&P 500, it received an immediate 7% bump in its share price. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) received a 4% boost upon the news that it would have a place in the index.\n\nWhat's more, the stocks continued to benefit for some time as active funds that are benchmarked against the index were compelled to buy more shares of the heavily weighted stocks. Alphabet and Facebook are two of the largest companies in the S&P 500. Snap, with its market cap floating around $30 billion, would be more moderately weighted than both, but it would still see similar benefits.\n\nSnap knew this was a possibility\n\nIn Snap's S-1 filing with the SEC, it wrote that it couldn't predict whether its decision to make its Class A shares non-voting \"will result in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences.\" Certainly, it saw it as a possibility, and it even noted that no other company has made an IPO with non-voting shares.\n\nWhile Snap's capital structure is different from those of most U.S. companies, it's worth noting that it's not the only company with non-voting shares. In fact, Alphabet has two publicly traded share classes -- one voting and one non-voting -- and it's included in the S&P 500. Likewise, Facebook plans to issue two non-voting (Class C) shares to current shareholders of any class under its approved stock split plan.\n\nBut the fact that investors cannot buy voting shares of Snap on the open market makes its situation unique.\n\nHow will it impact investors?\n\nWhile having buyer support in the form of institutional investors is a nice insurance policy, it's not the only thing that matters. After all, the primary driver of a stock's value is the underlying company's performance. If Snap can continue growing its user base and revenue at a rapid clip, the share price should inevitably climb to meet its fundamental performance.\n\nThere are a lot of question marks surrounding Snap, especially in light of the recent slowdown in user growth seemingly brought on by the increased intensity of Facebook's competition. The potential for several major indexes to exclude the stock make it even riskier.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Choose well, and these high-risk yet potentially high-reward stocks can deliver multibagger returns and turbocharge your portfolio's overall performance. But choose poorly, and a small-cap stock can produce painful losses, up to and including a complete loss of capital should the business be forced into bankruptcy.\n\nThat's why it's so important to invest in only the best of these businesses -- those poised to benefit from undeniable long-term trends and enjoy the largest growth opportunities. Read on to learn about one such business that meets these challenging criteria -- and that is one of the small-cap stocks best positioned to reward investors in the years ahead.\n\nImage source: Mindbody.\n\nMindbody (NASDAQ: MB) provides cloud-based software solutions to the health and wellness industry: Think spas, yoga studios, and fitness classes. It's a massive market that's gone largely underserved -- and Mindbody is working to address that need.\n\nMindbody's all-in-one solution helps its clients manage nearly every aspect of their businesses. Need to post an online class schedule and allow your clients to book appointments through their smartphones? Mindbody has you covered. Want an easy way to manage your employees' schedules? No problem. How about processing payments? Mindbody can help you with that, too.\n\nWith plans starting at just $75 per month, Mindbody's offerings are affordable even for start-ups with the most limited financial resources. And an increasing number of larger businesses are utilizing Mindbody's more extensive -- and higher-priced -- packages. In this way, Mindbody is able to scale its business along with the success of its customers.\n\nMore than 60,000 businesses have turned to Mindbody's platform for these solutions. That's up from less than 34,000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2014. During this time, Mindbody's revenue has nearly doubled from $70 million in 2014 to $139 million last year.\n\nStill, Mindbody is not yet profitable , which is likely why its stock is currently trading for around $27; properly valuing early-stage growth companies can be difficult. But at that price, Mindbody's current $1.1 billion market cap drastically understates its market potential. The 60,000 businesses Mindbody currently serves are just a tiny fraction -- about 1.5% -- of the 4.2 million wellness businesses that the company says exists around the world. And its $139 million in revenue is just a smidgeon of the $9.5 billion that Mindbody estimates as the current size of its addressable market -- a market that itself is growing, as more people come to understand the benefits of fitness and overall healthier living. That's a massive untapped opportunity that could offer Mindbody years -- and potentially even decades -- of strong growth.\n\nMindbody's powerful network effects should allow it to capture the lion's share of this immense market. Each new user expands the base of potential customers for Mindbody's business clients, and each business that joins Mindbody's platform increases the number of wellness offerings that users can choose among. It's a virtuous cycle that should continue to grow stronger as Mindbody expands its user and subscriber counts in the coming years.\n\nTo further strengthen its ecosystem, Mindbody reached a deal with Under Armour (NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) that lets the more than 180 million users of Under Armour's MyFitnessPal app sign up for classes offered by Mindbody's subscribers. Mindbody also has a partnership with Alphabet 's Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) allowing people in several major cities to book classes listed on Mindbody directly through Google Search and Maps. These two titans choosing to partner with Mindbody is a major vote of confidence for its platform, and I wouldn't be surprised if a company like Under Armour makes a bid for Mindbody at some point in the future.\n\nAll told, Mindbody is a leader in a huge and expanding industry with the ability to grow its market share exponentially in the years ahead. And at current prices, Mindbody offers long-term investors a chance at multibagger-type returns in the coming decade.

Speaking at the event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai made it clear that he sees Google Cloud as an incredibly important part of the search giant's future, and not just one of the company's many side bets. \"To me, Google Cloud is a natural extension of our mission to make the world's information accessible and usable,\" Pichai said.\n\nThe distinction is that while search helps regular users access information, cloud computing infrastructure and the related value-added services like analytics help the enterprise organize and access their information. The cloud infrastructure market is booming, growing 49% last year to $38.1 billion, according to market researcher Canalys. It's expected to jump another 46% this year to $55.8 billion. As the market grows, so, too, does the impact on the financials of the major players: Google Cloud, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS.\n\nGoogle data center in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Image source: Google.\n\nAs such, the former two should start disclosing exactly how much cloud revenue they're bringing in.\n\nFollow Amazon's lead\n\nI never thought I'd see the day when Amazon was leading the way in investor transparency, given the e-commerce giant's long-standing refusal to share various operating metrics that are pertinent to investors. Yet, when it comes to AWS and cloud revenue, Amazon is doing just that; Amazon started sharing AWS financials in 2015. AWS revenue was $12.2 billion last year, translating into $3.1 billion in operating income.\n\nMicrosoft only discloses growth rates for Azure (up 93% last quarter), but lacking a base number, that data point is less meaningful. We do know that total revenue in Microsoft's intelligent cloud segment, which includes Azure among other offerings, was $6.9 billion last quarter, resulting in $2.4 billion in operating income. Lacking an official figure, JPMorgan analysts estimate Azure revenue for all of 2016 was $2.7 billion, which would make AWS nearly five times bigger.\n\nGoogle includes Google Cloud revenue within its Google other revenues segment, which generated a hair over $10 billion in sales in 2016. That also includes revenue from Google Play as well as the company's growing hardware portfolio. One particularly prominent Google Cloud customer that just went public likely spent between $400 million to $450 million last year, and is committed to $400 million per year for the next five years , so there's that.\n\nSharing is caring\n\nYou could reasonably argue that AWS is far more important to Amazon than its peers' respective cloud businesses, though, specifically since AWS is by far the market leader and it's such a major contributor to profitability due to razor-thin margins in the core e-commerce business. In contrast, Google and Microsoft enjoy much higher gross margin, as they each specialize in software and services.\n\nStill, the cloud infrastructure market is only going to become increasingly important in the years ahead, and investors will want to see the results from the three largest players to assess each company's competitiveness. Google and Microsoft should start sharing more, especially if it's as important as Pichai says it is.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

YouTube TV will include 40 live channels and will be initially available in select markets.\n\nWhile YouTube TV is missing quite a few channels compared with competing services, it has the potential to attract a lot of attention from media companies in the future thanks to one huge advantage over the competitors: Google, the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary and owner of YouTube, is one of the best digital video advertisers in the world.\n\nImage source: YouTube\n\nDisney already sees the value in digital streaming\n\nDisney (NYSE: DIS) CEO Bob Iger is actively trying to get his networks into digital skinny bundles. Indeed, Disney's networks, including ESPN, are available in the lowest-priced tiers of all of the aforementioned streaming services.\n\nImportantly, Disney is not sacrificing any of its affiliate fees to get its channels into those tiers. \"The per-channel fees, which we are not getting too specific about, are commensurate with what the fees are on the existing services,\" Iger said about its deal with DirecTV Now.\n\nBut there's an added benefit to going digital. \"Some of the technology platforms will offer dynamic ad insertion. We think that that has got some real potential for the company,\" Iger told investors on the company's third-quarter earnings call last year.\n\nDynamic ad insertion allows media companies to serve targeted ads to viewers instead of using the one-size-fits-all system of traditional live broadcasts. YouTube TV may give media companies the opportunity to tap into Google's targeting data. On top of that, YouTube already has millions of advertisers on its platform, which it could tap for more premium YouTube TV ads.\n\nMedia companies might give YouTube TV a bigger break on affiliate fees if it can produce meaningfully higher ad revenue per viewer than its competitors.\n\nYouTube will have a chance to prove itself, too\n\nMedia companies will handle the majority of their ad buying at the launch of YouTube TV, but YouTube will have access to about two minutes of ads for every hour of viewing. That's the ad inventory that every cable company receives. If YouTube can use its decade of advertising experience and produce outsize results, it could increase interest from media companies for its services.\n\nThat bit of advertising is about the only thing that will make YouTube TV profitable, as analysts estimate its affiliate fees total about $29 before accounting for various regional sports networks, which could add $4 to $5.\n\nSuffice it to say YouTube TV has a lot running on that small slice of advertising inventory.\n\nTaking on a $71 billion market\n\nThe market Google is going after with YouTube TV isn't so much the pay-TV market as it is the television advertising market. Google tried to break into the market before by partnering with media companies about a decade ago. Now, it's using YouTube TV as a platform to gain access to that inventory, which generated about $71 billion in the U.S. last year.\n\nGetting YouTube TV off the ground and showing media companies what it's capable of with advertising is the first step. The more successful it is with its own ad inventory, the more likely it is to win the business of more media companies. In turn, more customers will sign up as the value improves and YouTube is able to bring on more networks.\n\nIf YouTube TV is successful, it will be because its superior advertising makes it a win-win-win -- the media companies, the consumers, and YouTube.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (C shares)\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The deal, which sent MBLY stock soaring 28% in active trade Monday, \"merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in a statement. “The saying 'what's under the hood' will increasingly refer to computing, not horsepower.”\n\nInvestors weren’t immediately impressed, sending Intel shares down 2.1% to close at a three-month low of $35.16. This isn’t Intel’s first run at self-driving cars, however. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip giant, through its financing arm Intel Capital, has spent $250 million in R&D looking for an edge. The Mobileye deal, meanwhile, has now made it known that autonomous driving capabilities was never a hobby for Intel. It’s become a critical market for the company.\n\nStill, Tesla and Google won’t be run off the road. In December, Google launched Waymo, which stands for “a new way forward in mobility.” Waymo’s website features a two-seater prototype fitted with Google’s hardware and software that is built to move with the touch of a button, with neither a steering wheel nor a brake pedal. Meanwhile, in Tesla’s most popular sedan, the Model S, the company has already rolled out self-driving capabilities that receive incremental updates on autopilot features.\n\nThese updates, which include “exit ramp autonomy” on highways, automatic lane-changing, and auto-steering, are also available to Model X, its SUV family. And to say nothing about Apple’s ( AAPL ) own autonomous car ambitions, which the Wall Street Journal recently confirmed. With more money stashed than the U.S. Treasury, Apple’s autonomous car position depends only on how hard it wants to mash the accelerator.\n\nBut here’s the thing: Mobileye was once a prominent partner to Tesla, meaning it could have had first-hand knowledge of what Tesla has under its hood. And to the extent Intel can utilize that knowledge to accelerate its own technology, Intel will narrow that gap relatively quickly.\n\nAt the same time, the fact that Intel wants to emerge as the go-to chip name when it comes to autonomous car processors, powering functions such as displays and communication between two self-driving vehicles, Intel doesn’t necessarily have to be the car, it can just be the brains inside the car — something it thrived on during the height of the PC era.", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhen it comes to investing, Warren Buffett says investors should go with index funds. But Buffett himself takes a different approach by buying individual stocks, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The question is: Should you do as Buffett says and index, or do as Buffett does , and buy AAPL stock?\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBuffett's lack of technology exposure is well-known among Wall Street veterans. In fact, many even ridiculed the Oracle of Omaha for missing out names like Apple, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ).\n\n\n\nUntil Apple came along, International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) was Buffett's largest tech play. He used to say he skipped over tech stocks because he didn't understand them well enough.\n\nBut it appears that Buffett's understanding of technology is growing.\n\nI n 2016, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.B ) reported a 9.8 million-share position in AAPL stock as of March 31. That position almost doubled to 15.2 million shares as of Sept. 30, then almost quadrupled to a whopping 57.3 million shares by year's end.\n\nSo what has Buffett done with AAPL stock in 2017?\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha has more than doubled his position . The stake now stands at some 133 million shares worth about $18.1 billion. Buffett buying some 75 million shares of AAPL stock in such a short span shows confidence in Apple.\n\nWhile Buffett is not known for his short-term predictions, he is heralded for his long-term investments. So, what does he like so much about Apple stock anyway? \"Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product, and an enormously useful product to people that use it,\" Buffett told CNBC in late-February.\n\nPerhaps the most ironic part of Buffett's discussion on Apple centered on his own device - the famed investor doesn't even own an iPhone.\n\nPositives for AAPL Stock\n\nApple stock has a lot of positives. For starters, the company is flush with cash. With more than $40 per share of cash, Apple could go on a transformative M&A spree - even with the repatriation tax that, right now, it would have to pay. Add in the potential for a tax repatriation holiday from the Trump administration, and Apple's in even better shape.\n\nAdditionally, Apple is a cash cow that continues to bring in billions of dollars each quarter, which should help continue to fund dividends and stock buybacks. Plus, its cash hoard should continue to grow over time.\n\nDespite rallying more than 40% over the past eight months, AAPL stock still trades with a below-market valuation. Sporting a price-to-earnings ratio of around 16, it's hard to consider Apple overvalued.\n\nAnd the valuation argument is important. Too many investors try to justify a higher Apple stock price by applying a market-average multiple. That's an inaccurate measurement, as Apple tends to trade between a P/E range of 10 to 17 (more on that in a moment). So rarely will it trade in-line with the average S&P 500 stock.\n\nWith that said, having a low valuation is part of what makes Apple stock attractive. Shares go through pretty extreme ups and downs. But long-term investors can feel confident in buying a stock that's not egregiously priced.\n\nFinally, investors can look forward to Apple releasing the much-anticipated iPhone 8 later this fall. With a higher potential selling price and plenty of fancy features, the new device is likely to drive record results.\n\nAdd on its quickly growing, high-margin Services business, and AAPL stock becomes even more attractive for long-term investors.\n\n\n\nShould You Follow Buffett Into AAPL Stock?\n\nWith all these positives, Apple stock may seem like a slam-dunk.\n\nHowever, I think investors would be best off waiting for a pullback. While we just highlighted its P/E ratio as a positive, it is close to the top of its five-year range. AAPL stock is cheap compared to the average stock, but getting expensive compared to its historical average.\n\nAdditionally, Apple stock has gone on a massive rally. While it's admittedly consolidating nicely just under $140, I find it hard to be a buyer at these levels.\n\nWith the overall market still up big, I can sleep more comfortably at night waiting for a pullback to buy Apple stock. If it doesn't materialize, that is something waiting investors will have to live with. I would rather miss a few points of upside in order to avoid significant points on the downside.\n\nHistorically, Apple's stock is volatile, which makes a pullback likely at some point in the next few months.\n\nA 7% to 10% correction would be needed for me to get interested.\n\nBret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips .

(AAPL) Stock … Yet appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE: GSK) has the resources to pursue long-term bets in medicine that could eventually change the course of disease treatment and yield large payoffs. Three and half years ago the company announced its plans for an audacious goal: to literally eavesdrop on the body's electrical system and enter into the body's own internal conversations in order to heal disease.\n\nNot as crazy as it sounds\n\nMedicine has long focused on chemical processes to alter biological function, but every organ has a nerve connection that regulates its function. Organs are controlled by patterns of electrical impulses transmitted through nerve fibers, but when organs dysfunction in chronic disease, the electrical patterns are different. That fact opens up the possibility that inserting patterns in nerves to certain organs can correct conditions that lead to disease. Using electrical impulses to influence organ function is nothing new -- cardiac pacemakers have been in use for decades -- but scientists are just beginning to realize the possibilities of using nerve signals to restore organs to normal function and actually treat disease.\n\nImage source: GlaxoSmithKline plc.\n\nA seminal paper was published in the scientific journal Nature in 2000 which presented evidence that stimulation of the vagus nerve could actually trigger an anti-inflammatory response in rats. Electrical stimulation of the nerve inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which is also the mechanism used by some blockbuster anti-inflammatory drugs such as AbbVie 's Humira. Since then, researchers have come to believe that influencing the the body's electrical system could lead to treatments for conditions as diverse as asthma, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, hypertension, diabetes, infertility, and even cancer. A drug gets dispersed throughout the body, affecting multiple pathways and organs in the process and potentially causing undesired side effects, but targeting the signals of a specific nerve bundle with an implanted device has the potential for producing highly localized and specific effects.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline announced in 2013 an effort to pour resources into the field of bioelectronics, taking a leadership role in the industry. The company announced a $1 million innovation prize, the creation and funding of a network of researchers, and the launch of a $50 million venture capital fund, Action Potential Venture Capital, to invest in pioneering bioelectronic technologies.\n\nThe investment is already producing visible progress. The first investment by the venture capital fund was in SetPoint Medical, a privately held California company that is developing a platform to treat inflammatory diseases by modulating nerve signals with implanted devices and was co-founded by one of the authors of the original 2000 paper in Nature. In July 2016 the company reported the results of a first-in-human study of vagal nerve stimulation by an implanted device for treatment of arthritis. The study showed that the approach inhibited TNF production and improved symptoms, including in some patients who had not responded to conventional drug treatments. In January 2017, SetPoint reported positive results of another human study using its device to treat Crohn's disease.\n\nGoogling the body's internal network\n\nImage source: GlaxoSmithKline plc.\n\nAs encouraging as the results from SetPoint are, that approach is primitive compared with the ambitions of a $715 million joint venture that Glaxo and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) birthed last August called Galvani Bioelectronics. The collaboration with Verily Life Sciences, formerly known as Google Life Sciences, aims to do no less than to map the human nervous system, crack the electrical codes flowing through nerves controlling the body's organs, and be able to modify the signals to restore health using implantable devices the size of a grain of rice.\n\nThe effort has enormous potential... and enormous challenges. Verily will contribute expertise in device miniaturization and software. The tiny devices will need a read/write interface to nerve fibers and a way to be powered without heating the body -- both significant technical problems yet to be solved. The approach will also require the analysis and interpretation of massive amounts of data taken from the signals sensed on individual bundles of nerves controlling the targeted organs, something that's right up Google's alley. Glaxo, for its part, has been working for several years on a \"nerve atlas\" with the goal of identifying the specific nerve fibers whose signals will need to be decoded and modulated.\n\nA long shot, but we could get news by 2019\n\nExecutives from GlaxoSmithKline and Verily are optimistic, though. At the time of the announcement last August, Glaxo executive Moncef Slaoui expressed the belief that Galvani could begin human trials within 18 months, achieve proof of concept in three years, and begin commercialization in seven years. This timeline puts the effort on the radar of long-term investors, who could be seeing news on developments in the next few years.\n\nThe challenge is huge, but then so is the potential payoff. \"Bioelectronic medicines have the potential of doing to the pharmaceutical industry what biopharmaceuticals did to small molecules back in the 1980s,\" says Imran Eba, partner in Action Potential Venture Capital. If that happens, GlaxoSmithKline could be in ideal position to benefit from the next big disruption in medical technology.\n\n10 stocks we like better than GlaxoSmithKline\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.\n\nClick here to find out which 9 other ETFs had notable inflows »", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBy most accounts, the future looks bright for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Citi recently upped its price target on Apple stock in anticipation of a massive wave of upgrades from iPhone owners who have aging models, and the company's plans to double its high-margin service revenue over the course of the coming four years doesn't seem un-doable.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAfter all, AAPL has been beefing up its app and digital content business at a rather brisk pace for some time now.\n\nAnd yet, to observers not looking at the company through rose-colored glasses, there's potential trouble ahead. Here's a closer look at three headwinds that could slow AAPL shares down more than most traders might expect.\n\nThree Troubling Realities for Apple Stock\n\nLast week, analysts with Citi raised their price target on Apple stock from $140 to $160 per share (maintaining the research outfit's \"Buy\" rating), thinking a wide swath of the 715 million iPhone owners out there right now are on the verge of finally upgrading their device, as 31% of those owners haven't upgraded in a couple of years .\n\nIt's not bad logic; we know the company's best new customers are its old ones.\n\nMeanwhile, though it was little more than an afterthought just a year ago, CEO Tim Cook has put plenty of emphasis on sales of services and digital content. He's only scratched the surface, however. After generating roughly $25 billion in revenue in 2016, Apple is aiming for $50 billion in services revenue by $50 billion. That's still only a fraction of the $215 billion worth of revenue Apple mustered in 2016, but digital sales now make up the company's second-biggest segment; the iPhone is still the biggest.\n\nBefore we pop the corks on the champagne bottles though, there are three red flags everyone would be wise to process.\n\n1. The iPhone 8 (probably) costs too much\n\nWhile the launch of the iPhone 7 in the fall of last year could be considered a success in that the company sold a record-breaking 78.2 million units in the previous quarter , given the hype surrounding the device , the company should have blown away sales figures for its iPhone 6.\n\nSome (many) suspect the demand that should have materialized for the 7 was ultimately displaced to the iPhone 8, which is supposed to be unveiled in September of this year. The word is that the admittedly impressive device is going to go for a cool $1000 each . At that price, even the most loyal of Apple fans could balk.\n\n2. The popular smartphone is preemptively cannibalizing itself\n\nAside from sticker shock, would-be owners of the upcoming iPhone 8 may keep their wallet closed for the same reason many potential buyers of the iPhone 7 didn't pull the trigger - they're waiting for the phone after the next phone, which is sure to be even more amazing.\n\nTo that end, what's currently being referred to as the iPhone 9 already promises (in rumors) to be an amazing piece of hardware, complete with a folding screen . That may postpone purchases of the iPhone 8 later this year, though 2018's iPhone 9 could see softer demand because whispers of the iPhone 10 rumors will be circulating by then.\n\nIt's a vicious cycle, with Apple arguably unable to ever really log a blowout iPhone launch.\n\n3. The Google Pixel is really, really impressive\n\nFinally, as solid as the recent Pixel phone from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) subsidiary Google was, it wasn't a game-changer. Analysts estimate the company only sold about 2.5 million of the device .\n\nBear in mind, however, this is Google's first direct foray into the smartphone world, and could be considered little more than a dry run. The Pixel 2 is slated to debut sometime this year , and it's a good bet the company has made a point of learning a lot with its first outing.\n\nBottom Line for AAPL Stock\n\nInvariably, some (or several) owners of Apple stock interpret these concerns as a call that the company is doomed, and then proceed to \"colorfully disagree.\" So, let me clarify something that shouldn't need saying. That is, even on AAPL stock's worst day it's still essentially unstoppable to other smartphone players. Don't read too much into the worries.\n\nOn the flipside, in that Apple stock is all too often found on investors' pedestals - lifted there by assumptions that the company is infallible - it's never a bad idea to recognize all plausible risks. These three risks could each end up stirring up surprising headwinds, and nothing takes a toll on a stock like an unexpected disappointment.\n\nAs of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post 3 Reasons Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Becoming Tougher to Own appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "(Published March 13 by Nicholas McCullum)\n\nShareholders are the ultimate owners of any publicly traded business.\n\nBy putting capital on the line to gain fractional ownership of a company, shareholders will participate in the successes (and failures) of the underlying business.\n\nCompany management teams have some very obvious goals that are dictated by shareholders, including:\n\nMaximize profits\n\nMinimize expenses\n\nReduce reputational risk\n\nMake ethical and socially responsible decisions\n\nThere are also certain behaviors that are considered to be shareholder-friendly, which typically include dividend payments and share repurchases.\n\nThis article will discuss six signs of a shareholder-friendly stock in detail.\n\nReasonable levels of executive compensation\n\nExecutive compensation is a hot topic on both Main Street and Wall Street.\n\nThe CEOs of large corporations are almost always the highest-paid employees, and total compensation can reach the $20 million-plus range.\n\nFurther, CEO compensation has been growing more quickly than the rest of the 0.1% and the stock market (as measured by the S&P 500).\n\nSource: Economic Policy Institute\n\nThere are two measures by which the shareholder-friendliness of a company's executive compensation program can be checked.\n\nFirst, the total compensation package of a business' upper-level management should be in the same range as its peers.\n\nInformation about executive compensation is disclosed in a filing called the Definitive 14A proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nYou can find company filings with the SEC by searching this database. For information on executive compensation, search for \"DEF 14A\" filings, which will return the company's \"Other definitive proxy statements.\"\n\nFor an example, you can see Johnson & Johnson 's ( JNJ ) CEO compensation package below.\n\nSource: Johnson & Johnson Proxy Circular\n\nAnother important consideration is whether executive compensation is dependent on the performance of the business they lead.\n\nIn most cases, this is certainly the case. CEO compensation is usually dependent on the company meeting certain financial performance targets.\n\nThese targets are outlined in the same DEF 14A filings with the SEC. Johnson & Johnson's criteria for its executive compensation package can be seen below.\n\nSource: Johnson & Johnson Proxy Circular\n\nFor investors looking to own shareholder-friendly companies, finding businesses whose executive compensation practices are reasonable and dependent on company performance is a great place to start.\n\nHigh levels of insider ownership\n\nInsider ownership is when company insiders (executives, board members, etc.) own company stock.\n\nWhen insider ownership levels are high, it means the company's management has a lot of faith in the business' investment prospects.\n\nSince management knows more about the business than any investor, shareholders can rest assured the most informed individuals are confident in the company's future.\n\nThe requirement of insider ownership is also seen as shareholder-friendly corporate governance.\n\nDetails about executive stock ownership requirements can also be found in the company's 14A proxy statements.\n\nFor instance, Johnson & Johnson's executive stock ownership requirements can be seen below.\n\nSource: Johnson & Johnson Proxy Statement, page 44\n\nNotice the stock ownership guidelines are expressed as a multiple of base salary. This is typical among companies that require executives to be shareholders.\n\nA textbook example of high insider ownership is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B).\n\nBerkshire is a large conglomerate with holdings in many industries (including insurance, manufacturing and railways) that also has a large portfolio of common stock investments.\n\nYou can see an analysis of Berkshire Hathaway's top 20 high-yield dividend stocks here.\n\nIn Berkshire Hathaway's 2016 definitive proxy statement, the company reported Buffett owned 38.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's Class A stock. This high level of insider ownership is almost unheard of in a company as large as Berkshire.\n\nInsider ownership (and the requirement of insider ownership) is a sign of a shareholder-friendly stock.\n\nClear communication with shareholders\n\nThrough shareholder presentations and press releases, a company's management team has plenty of opportunities to communicate with shareholders.\n\nCompanies who make the most of these communication opportunities should be appreciated by their investors. There are two benefits to investing in companies that readily communicate with shareholders:\n\nGain a greater understanding of the underlying business.\n\nGain a greater understanding of the business' prospects.\n\nFor the first point, there is no better example than Buffett (again).\n\nHis shareholder letters often elaborate on Berkshire's businesses in much more detail than is required by regulators.\n\nThis helps investors understand the intricacies of the $433 billion conglomerate.\n\nA great example of a company whose management is clear about the business' prospects is 3M ( MMM ). The company is very clear about its long-term goals for business growth:\n\nSource: 3M Investor Presentation, slide 14\n\nThe Coca-Cola Co. (KO) is another business that is similarly candid about business prospects.\n\nIn the company's presentation at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) conference, it provided the following slide on its 2016 outlook.\n\nSource: Coca-Cola 2016 CAGNY Presentation, slide 47\n\nAs with most things, financial forecasting is best digested in moderation. Even the wisest management teams cannot fully predict the future.\n\nBusiness forecasts that go beyond the realm of reasonable prediction should be considered a red flag by investors.\n\nBuffett has warned against excessive forecasting in the past, writing the following in a letter to shareholders:\n\n\" Finally, be suspicious of companies that trumpet earnings projections and growth expectations. Businesses seldom operate in a tranquil, no-surprise environment, and earnings simply don't advance smoothly (except, of course, in the offering books of investment bankers). \"\n\nSource: Berkshire Hathaway 2002 Annual Report, page 2\n\nWith that in mind, management teams that work to help investors understand their business and its growth prospects (within reason) are a sign of a shareholder-friendly company.\n\nAcceptable use of adjusted financial metrics\n\nWhen companies report earnings, they have the option to report adjusted earnings per share, which generally backs out one-time expenses such as:\n\nRestructuring charges\n\nSeverance packages\n\nOne-time tax liabilities\n\nAnd other metrics that are perceived to impede comparability to previous fiscal years.\n\nIncluding adjusted earnings in shareholder reports is completely optional. The proportion of companies that include adjusted financial metrics has been rising over time however.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nBuffett commented on this trend in Berkshire Hathaway's 2016 Annual Report:\n\n\" Too many managements - and the number seems to grow every year - are looking for any means to report, and indeed feature, 'adjusted earnings' that are higher than their company's GAAP earnings. There are many ways for practitioners to perform this legerdemain. Two of their favorites are the omission of 'restructuring costs' and 'stock-based compensation' as expenses. \"\n\nSource: Berkshire Hathaway 2016 Annual Report, page 16\n\nBuffett later elaborates on each of these, saying about restructuring costs:\n\n\" Berkshire, I would say, has been restructuring from the first day we took over in 1965. [...]We have never, however, singled out restructuring charges and told you to ignore them in estimating our normal earning power. If there were to be some truly major expenses in a single year, I would, of course, mention it in my commentary.\"\n\nSource: Berkshire Hathaway 2016 Annual Report, page 16\n\nAnd later, on the exclusion of stock-based compensation in the calculation of adjusted earnings:\n\n\" If CEOs want to leave out stock-based compensation in reporting earnings, they should be required to affirm to their owners one of two propositions: why items of value used to pay employees are not a cost or why a payroll cost should be excluded when calculating earnings. \"\n\nSource: Berkshire Hathaway 2016 Annual Report, page 16\n\nIt is perfectly acceptable for a company to report adjusted earnings under one condition - shareholders read and understand the reconciliation between adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings.\n\nThese reconciliations can be found in quarterly earnings presentations. For example, the Walt Disney Co. ( DIS ) included the following reconciliation in its first-quarter earnings release:\n\nSource: The Walt Disney Company Investor Document\n\nDisney's reconciliation is simple and easy to understand - which makes its use of adjusted earnings helpful and acceptable.\n\nAnother alternative method of presenting a company's perceived earnings power is through EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.\n\nBuffett, among others, has been vocally critical of this metric in the past since the implication is that the four excluded costs (interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) are not true expenses.\n\n\" Every dime of depreciation expense we report is a real cost. That's true, moreover, at most other companies. When CEOs tout EBITDA as a valuation guide, wire them up for a polygraph test. \"\n\nSource: Berkshire Hathaway 2014 Annual Report, page 15\n\nBuffett's criticism of EBITDA has been long-standing. He also commented on the use of EBITDA in his 2002 shareholder letter, and probably earlier.\n\n\" Trumpeting EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a particularly pernicious practice. Doing so implies that depreciation is not truly an expense, given that it is a 'non-cash' charge. That's nonsense. In truth, depreciation is a particularly unattractive expense because the cash outlay it represents is paid up front, before the asset acquired has delivered any benefits to the business. \"\n\nSource: Berkshire Hathaway 2002 Annual Report, page 21\n\nOverall, investors should only accept the use of adjusted financial metrics if they can understand the reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP metrics.\n\nShare repurchases\n\nShare repurchases involve a company buying its own stock on the open market with the intent of reducing the number of shares outstanding.\n\nThis is beneficial because the company's financial results are divided among less shares.\n\nShare repurchases can have a pretty remarkable effect on bottom line growth and shareholder returns. The table below shows the amazing compounding power of a business that:\n\nGrows earnings at 8% a year\n\nTrades at a constant price-earnings ratio of 15\n\nUses 75% of earnings on share repurchases\n\nNote this is a very simplified example because earnings growth, valuation multiples and share repurchases will all tend to fluctuate over time.\n\nMore importantly, note most of the total return was due to the share repurchases. The company's stock price grew by more than a factor of 10, while earnings grew by a factor of approximately 4.6.\n\nWithout the buybacks, the company's return over the 20-year period would be less than half as large.\n\nShare repurchases create value only when the stock is trading at less than its perceived intrinsic value.\n\nIf company management repurchases shares at a high valuation, they are effectively \"buying three quarters for the price of a dollar.\"\n\nThis has the same value-destroying capabilities as when investors buy overpriced stocks on the open market.\n\nBuffett commented on this in his 2016 Annual Report:\n\n\" For continuing shareholders, however, repurchases only make sense if the shares are bought at a price below intrinsic value. When that rule is followed, the remaining shares experience an immediate gain in intrinsic value. Consider a simple analogy: If there are three equal partners in a business worth $3,000 and one is bought out by the partnership for $900, each of the remaining partners realizes an immediate gain of $50. If the exiting partner is paid $1,100, however, the continuing partners each suffer a loss of $50. The same math applies with corporations and their shareholders. Ergo, the question of whether a repurchase action is value-enhancing or value-destroying for continuing shareholders is entirely purchase-price dependent.\"\n\nSource: Berkshire Hathaway 2016 Annual Report, page 7\n\nA good example of a company repurchasing undervalued shares recently is Apple ( AAPL ).\n\nBecause of its incredibly popular products like the iPhone, Mac and iPad, Apple has a massive cash hoard that has been effectively deployed to repurchase shares.\n\nIn the company's first-quarter earnings release, Apple reported $10.9 billion spent on repurchases of common stock, which is more than three times the $3.1 billion spent on dividend payments.\n\nSource: Apple First Quarter 8-K , page 6\n\nThese buybacks have followed Buffett's rule of only repurchasing undervalued shares.\n\nApple has traded at a notably lower price-earnings ratio than its peers (large-cap technology companies) over the past few years, and this trend continues today:\n\nApple: 16.7\n\nAlphabet ( GOOG ) (GOOGL): 30.2\n\n( GOOG ) (GOOGL): 30.2 Microsoft (MSFT): 30.6\n\n(MSFT): 30.6 Facebook (FB): 39.6\n\nThe valuation multiples listed above are based on trailing 12-month GAAP EPS.\n\nWhen assessing a company's investment prospects, the two main buyback-related considerations are whether it is engaged in a buyback program currently and whether the management states a particular price or valuation at which they would be happy to repurchase stock.\n\nDividend payments\n\nDividend payments are an important part of shareholder returns.\n\nDividends are the only way for an investor to profit from investing in a company without reducing or eliminating their ownership stake.\n\nDividends also have a high degree of correlation with shareholder returns. In a previous analysis, I examined the long-term (2000 to 2015) correlations of a variety of financial metrics and total returns.\n\nYou can see the results of that analysis below.\n\nSource: Publicly Available Financial Statements\n\nDividend payments demonstrated higher correlation with total returns than any other financial metric - even earnings per share.\n\nThe outperformance of companies that consistently raise their dividends can be seen when looking at the Dividend Aristocrats Index, which is comprised of companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend payments.\n\nYou can see the list of all 51 Dividend Aristocrats here.\n\nThe performance of the Dividend Aristocrats is compared to the S&P 500 Index below.\n\nSource: Dividend Aristocrats Fact Sheet\n\nOver the past 10 years, the Dividend Aristocrats have returned 10.14% per year while the S&P 500 has returned 7.62% per year - an outperformance of 2.52%.\n\nWhen searching for shareholder-friendly stocks, dividend payments are one of the most important (and most straightforward) signs to look for.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nShareholder-friendly companies will make better investments than those that are not, all else being equal.\n\nFortunately, there are many telltale signs of a shareholder-friendly stock:\n\nReasonable levels of executive compensation High levels of insider ownership Clear communication with shareholders Acceptable use of adjusted financial metrics Share repurchases Dividend dayments\n\nIncorporating these signs into your investment process can help identify companies with management teams that have shareholders' best interests in mind.\n\nDisclosure: I am not long any of the stocks mentioned in this article.\n\nStart afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .", "Intel Corporation INTC on Monday announced it struck a deal to acquire driver assistance technology company Mobileye N.V.

Intel's stock dropped 2.31% to $35.08 per share.\n\nMobileye specializes in chip-based camera systems called \"artificial vision sensors.\" The technology alerts drivers in real-time to potential road hazards, like pedestrians. The company claims that the sensor technology is 99% accurate and helps prevent accidents. It is working towards putting this technology into self-driving car technology in the future. Mobileye currently helps support over 15 million vehicles.\n\nIsrael-based Mobileye was founded in 1999 and it went public in July 2014. The IPO came after Mobileye began to invest in driverless car technology. The company's current market cap is nearly $10.5 billion. In a memo to employees , Mobileye executives said Intel's existing automated-driving efforts will be integrated into the company, and existing Israel leaders will head up the efforts.\n\nIntel's $15.3 billion acquisition is the biggest ever for an Israeli technology company. The move positions Intel as a \"leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,\" according to a company statement Monday. \"Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030.\"\n\nMobileye previously worked with Tesla, Inc.

Sony (NYSE: SNE) began testing its own PlayStation Vue in select markets not long after that and has since taken its cable-like streaming product national. Most recently, AT&T (NYSE: T) launched DirecTV Now, giving consumers three distinct choices (not counting the not-yet-launched options from YouTube and Hulu which are still developing).\n\nFor consumers it's a lot of choices, but unlike traditional cable where every company offers roughly the same package, these three players are somewhat different. That makes determining the best one a bit of a moving target, but with three players in the space (and two more coming) it's clearly a buyer's market.\n\nDISH Sling has the cheapest offer. Image source: DISH.\n\nDISH has the lowest base price\n\nFor consumers looking to cut the cord in order to save money (or those who never had a cord, but are looking for the cheapest way to have some live-streaming channels) DISH's Sling TV may be the answer. The service offers 30 channels including ESPN, CNN, TNT, and a number of other cable favorites for $20 a month as part of its \"Orange\" package. For $25 a month consumers could opt for \"Blue\" which drops ESPN but adds the FOX family of channels including the broadcast network while offering 44 total choices.\n\nOn top of the base packages Sling Subscribers can choose from a number of extra add-ons in areas like news, sports, and kids programming which cost $5 or $10 each. Sling members can also add HBO, Cinemax, Starz, or one of a variety of global programming options which conveniently all work within the same player making for a very television-like experience.\n\nPlayStation Vue is cord-free cable\n\nSony's PlayStation Vue has four packages starting at $29.99 a month. The entry-level offer, \"Access Slim\" comes with 45 channels, including in very-limited markets some broadcast networks. Most of the stations offered are the same ones Sling TV has, with consumers paying slightly more money for them. The \"Core Slim\" package offers 60 channels for $34.99 (perhaps the best deal) while \"Elite Slim\" comes with 90 channels for $44.99, and Ultra Slim at $64.99 which has the same 90 channels plus HBO and Showtime.\n\nLike Sling, PlayStation Vue also offers add-on packages of Spanish-language and news programs. In addition users can buy a number of premium channels on a stand-alone basis along with HBO and Showtime. The bottom tiers for PS Vue are very similar to DISH, albeit pricier, while the higher-end tiers are essentially full-on cable packages (minus the broadcast networks in most cases) at better-than-cable pricing.\n\nHere's what DirecTV is doing\n\nAT&T's entree into the space looks a lot like Sony's. DirecTV Now offers very similar pricing with 60 channels costing $35, including ABC and FOX, along with some top-tier cable favorites. $50 a month gets users 80-plus channels, while $60 a month comes with over 100, and $70 takes the package to over 120 stations including Starz.\n\nSubscribers can also add Starz separately to lower-tier deals, or add HBO or Cinemax. AT&T does not offer add-on channel packages covering specialty stations the way its rivals do. In addition DirecTV Now launches with better pricing (the $35 price for the $50 package) and it seems likely that AT&T will offer future specials likely tied to bundling other services from the company.\n\nWhich one is the best?\n\nFor consumers it's easy to test each service because all offer free trials, while also letting users come and go as they please without contracts or penalties. Sling has the best service for people looking to cut expenses while Sony and AT&T offer good deals on services that come close to mirroring actual cable. Of those two, DirecTV Now gets a slight edge because it offers ABC and FOX nationally while PlayStation Vue only offers access to broadcast networks selectively.\n\nIn addition to varying channel selections, all three services have different rules when it comes to multiple streams. Sling Orange, the cheapest service, only offers a single stream, while the $25 Blue packages allows three. DirectTV Now offers two streams to all subscribers while Sony's service allows customers to stream on five registered devices at a time giving PS Vue the advantage in this area, but it's a minor edge over Blue.\n\nWhen it comes to interface all three leave something to be desired. Sony's service has a DVR (with a lot of limitations) while Sling has some on-demand programming, as does DirecTV. The biggest drawback of the streaming services is that none of them offer an experience that feels like flipping around with traditional cable. Still, once you have selected a show, the viewing experience works and feels familiar.\n\nSony and AT&T have decent products that save consumers some money over the average comparable cable package. But for a traditional family watching on multiple televisions, the savings may not be worth the holes in what's offered along with a viewing experience that still lags traditional cable. Sling has those same limitations, but the three streams for $25 Blue package represents the best combo of content and value, giving it a small victory in an emerging space.\n\n10 stocks we like better than DISH Network\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

BABA stock has garnered quite a bit of media attention since making its way onto the scene in 2014 and now analysts have started to compare the firm to its American counterpart Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ).\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAny stock that has been deemed \"the next Amazon\" deserves a second look, especially considering that AMZN has delivered returns of more than 2,000% to investors that bought into the stock 10 years ago.\n\nHowever, while AMZN and Alibaba are both e-commerce giants, it's important to consider whether the similarities end there.\n\nBABA's International Growth\n\nPerhaps the biggest determinant of whether BABA stock can live up to its comparison with AMZN is whether Alibaba will be able to move beyond China. At the moment the Chinese e-commerce market is BABA's bread and butter and the firm has done very little to break out of that bubble.\n\nThe problem with being reliant solely on Chinese customers is that Alibaba is limited in terms of future growth potential and the firm would also suffer alongside a slide in the Chinese economy.\n\nThat's not to say that BABA hasn't already taken steps to expand its business internationally - the firm's affiliate Ant Financial recently boughtMoneygram International Inc (NASDAQ: MGI ), which could eventually develop into Alibaba's own worldwide payments business.\n\nHowever, the Ant and Moneygram tie-up are still a big what-if for BABA stock. Right now, Alibaba has very little international exposure, without which the firm will never live up to AMZN.\n\nAlibaba Stock and Cloud Computing\n\nMuch like its American counterpart, BABA is building out a cloud computing business that is worth considering. Alibaba's cloud computing arm is in the very early stages, generating just $765 million in sales. BABA's cloud efforts have eaten into the firm's profitability, with the business losing more than $90 million last year. However, all of these figures aren't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nAlibaba was, by all accounts, a late entrant into the cloud computing space. That means that the company is having to spend significantly in order to gain market share. That explains the lack of profitability and should provide investors with some comfort about the business' inability to turn a profit. BABA's cloud computing business has also put up some pretty impressive growth metrics over the last few quarters as well - the firm gained 114,000 new customers and saw revenue growth of 115% in the December quarter.\n\nThe picture that Alibaba's financials paint of its cloud computing business looks very similar to Amazon Web Services five years ago, when it had just begun. It's important to consider the fact that BABA is starting its cloud business much later than Amazon did, but as the industry is still relatively new, that factor shouldn't hold BABA back.\n\nThere are definitely a lot of similarities between BABA and Amazon, especially if you believe in Alibaba's efforts to expand internationally and the firm's blossoming cloud computing arm. However, while they both oversee a massive e-commerce business, AMZN offers an impressive distribution and logistics network that BABA can't hold a candle to.\n\nAlso, Amazon's business model differs significantly from that of Alibaba . Amazon's business is a mix of direct sales and commission for its retail partners' sales. Alibaba, on the other hand, acts as a middleman for both small and large retailers.\n\nThe firm doesn't charge a commission, but instead sellers can pay to improve their ranking on BABA's search engine, so you could make the argument that Alibaba's business model is more similar to that of Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google.\n\nAlibaba Stock: A Different Kind of Risk\n\nIt's also important to note that even if the two were identical businesses, the fact that BABA is based in China and conducts most of its business there is a significant difference. As fellow InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto noted - cultural differences should be considered when you're comparing the two.\n\nGambling is much more widely accepted in Asian cultures, which could be part of the reason that the firm's share price has had such a roller-coaster ride since its IPO. Investors who are picking BABA as the next Amazon should be aware that even if the stock does deliver the same explosive growth that AMZN has, they may not see the same financial results as BABA stock has the potential to trade much more erratically.\n\nAlibaba stock does bear a striking resemblance to Amazon, especially in AMZN's early days. However, it's not worth buying BABA stock for that reason alone, because it is likely to behave much differently than AMZN did. With that being said, Alibaba stock isn't a bad growth play when you consider its potential expansion in the payments and cloud computing space.\n\nAs of this writing, Laura Hoy was long AMZN.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Is Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock Really Comparable to Amazon? appeared first on InvestorPlace ." ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.2316703827573393, 0.5800631313131314, 0.5075668623613829, 0.452142857142857, 0.4018627119408369, 0.4816631450560022, 0.4685935175935175, 0.3851546717171717, 0.3934338624338625, 0.4293969396939693 ], "headline" : [ "Jana Partners Sells Twitter, Alphabet, Priceline", "Can Intel Catch Tesla, Google, Apple In Autonomous Car Race?", "Don’t Follow Warren Buffett Into Apple Inc.

The specific worry is that ads will be shown alongside videos from extremist and terrorist groups, as well as anything portraying hate speech.\n\nAT&T Inc (NYSE: T ) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) have also pulled their ads since then. Per an AT&T spokesperson:\n\n\"We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate. Until Google can ensure this won't happen again, we are removing our ads from Google's non-search platforms.\"\n\nOther companies that have dropped their YouTube ads include HSBC Holdings plc (ADR) (NYSE: HSBC ), GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) (NYSE: GSK ) and Enterprise . The price target drop - from $970 to $950 - betrayed the downgrade a little, as that still implied roughly 10% upside in GOOGL stock from there.\n\nNonetheless, shares fell hard on the news, dropping nearly 4% between then and now, including a roughly 2% drop in Thursday's early trading.\n\nGOOGL shares plunged below their short-term 20-day average initially, and today have sunk below the 50-day moving average, which has provided support for shares twice since mid-December, when the stock surged through the MA.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) has plunged to 38 - low, but still not near oversold levels.\n\nFrom here, GOOGL stock risks a further drop to price support around $810 - another 3% from here. Below that would be the 200-day MA, which sits just below the $800 mark.\n\nLooked at optimistically, though, Alphabet has been setting a small series of higher lows and higher highs since the beginning of the new year, precipitously dropping off in February before rebounding to hit new highs above $870 just last week.\n\nThis very well could be a much-needed breather in GOOGL stock - one that has dunked the forward price-to-earnings ratio to a thoroughly digestible 21, which isn't shabby for a nearly $600 billion company that's still projected to grow revenues by double digits this year and next.\n\nAs of this writing, Robert Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post GOOGL Stock Is Falling Into a Funk appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Back in 2009, its namesake phones, which were considered indispensable to its customers, boasted an estimated 20% market share.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThat market share, when rounded, is now 0%. BlackBerry sold only a couple hundred thousand phones last quarter.\n\nThis pales in comparison to the millions of phones sold by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and those running Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android software. The BlackBerry stock price tells the tale - down 50% over the past five years.\n\nCan BlackBerry Stock Save Itself?\n\nBlackBerry has been trying to shift gears and now considers itself a mobile software firm. It is also targeting mobile security. It has officially given up on hardware and no longer makes its own phones. The firm has fallen from an industry leader to more or less fighting for survival. BlackBerry stock remains beaten down, but has potential with any operational recovery.\n\nBlackBerry released its fiscal third-quarter earnings back in December. The results weren't pretty . Sales fell 47% to $289 million and the net loss was $117 million, or 22 cents per share. Operating cash flow for the nine months of its fiscal year was a negative $242 million. Quarterly hardware sales fell by two-thirds to $70 million.\n\nPositively, the company still had nearly $1.3 billion in cash in the bank, or a couple of dollars per share. But netted against $607 million in debt and burning through cash as it repositions its business, it could fall to negligible levels if things don't turn around within the next several quarters.\n\nManagement put as positive a spin as it could on the most recent quarter: 80% of software sales are recurring and the firm boasted more than 3,000 enterprise customer orders during the quarter. Business customers had been extremely loyal to Blackberry as many individual consumers had used their \"Crackberry\" devices for both business and pleasure.\n\nIts press release touted its highest quarterly gross margins (67%) in the firm's history, operating profitability, and \"overall positive non-GAAP EPS.\" Back out enough losses, and most firms can achieve adjusted profitability. But the negative cash flow cannot be undone by accounting maneuvers.\n\nBlackBerry did say it expects to break even on a cash flow basis during the fourth quarter. It expects to report its latest results on March 31. It plans to update investors on a business venture with car giant Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) where it provides connected car and software licensing in certain Ford vehicles.\n\nDespite the few positive developments, BlackBerry's full year results are likely to be grim. Analysts expect sales to fall 37% to $1.4 billion and adjusted earnings of only a couple of pennies. Next year isn't projected to be any easier - analysts are calling for a sales decline of 28% to under a billion, and another couple of pennies of profits.\n\nDuring its earnings call, BlackBerry talked of enterprise software products where security is a key feature. Software that helps companies run mobile platforms and apps is clearly a growth industry, as is embedded mobile software for automobiles, such as those made by Ford.\n\nManagement also talked about huge opportunities in the Internet of Things, or IoT. It also licenses its software, such as with a partner in Indonesia. As it turns out, BlackBerry's messaging service remains hugely popular in Indonesia . It boasts 55 million active users, demonstrating the network effect that can help support a platform.\n\nBottom Line on BlackBerry Stock\n\nBlackBerry's service revenue growth is noteworthy, but doesn't appear to be accelerating rapidly. Its software seems to work well in automobiles, but anything to support self-driving cars appears to only be in prototype mode. Indonesia is a bright spot, but not enough to drive the overall company forward.\n\nBlackBerry operates in many appealing and growing industries, but seems to be at too much of a disadvantage compared to the competition. Apple's iOS and Google's Android software dominate the mobile phone space right now. Without the related hardware sales, it seems extremely difficult to see BlackBerry breaking back into a leadership position in the mobile market in a big way.\n\nInvestors would probably be best served by waiting to see how BlackBerry's fourth-quarter results turn out. The earnings release is just a couple of weeks away. If software sales come in ahead of expectations and cash flow trends perk up, shareholders might gain some confidence that the company can start returning to growth, or at least some level of consistent profitability.\n\nAs of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann is long shares of Alphabet, but did not hold a position in any of the other aforementioned securities.\n\nThe post BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Stock Is in 'Wait-And-See' Mode appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Three things seem pretty clear at this point in history:\n\nSelf-driving cars will begin coming to market before long.\n\nThey'll generate huge profits for some companies.\n\nGoogle has been a leader in developing self-driving technology.\n\nBut does it follow that Google's parent, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , will reap the rewards of its technological leadership? Or put another way, are the potential profits from self-driving cars a reason to add Alphabet's stock to your portfolio?\n\nA lot of commentators seem to think so, but I'm very skeptical. Here's why.\n\nDriverless \"panda cars\" were the public face of the Google Self-Driving Car Project for several years. Image source: Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet has what looks like a leadership position...\n\nGoogle began tinkering with self-driving cars way back in 2009, long before many investors began taking the technology seriously. The original team behind what became knows as the Google Self-Driving Car Project included several robotics all-stars who seemed ready to invent the future. The whole thing appeared to be decades beyond what the established automakers were doing.\n\nFor a while, it was. Of course, in the last few years, some automakers and auto-industry suppliers have invested heavily in the technology and made significant gains. But even so, Alphabet's self-driving unit, which was spun out of Google and renamed Waymo late last year, retains some big advantages:\n\nBy at least one measure -- \"disengagements,\" the number of times a human driver has to take control of a self-driving test car -- Waymo made major progress last year and appears to be ahead of most known rivals.\n\nMaps. The first self-driving cars to come to market will rely heavily on highly detailed maps as a backup to their sensors. Google has been mapping the world in ever-increasing detail for years; Waymo will have access to those maps, while its competitors will have to look elsewhere.\n\nWaymo has developed its own self-driving sensor hardware, including -- crucially -- LIDAR units that cost much less than current commercially available units.\n\nThose are significant advantages. But there's a big question that might not be obvious to investors who don't have a deep understanding of the auto industry:\n\nHow will Waymo bring all of that to market?\n\nWaymo's current test fleet was built in partnership with FCA, but the companies have disclosed no plans to collaborate on production vehicles. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.\n\n...but bringing it to market may prove complicated\n\nWaymo's CEO, John Krafcik, is a respected auto-industry veteran who was hired to lead the project in September 2015. Krafcik brought a welcome dose of realistic transparency to the project when he made it clear that Alphabet has no intention of manufacturing its own vehicles. Instead, he said, Waymo would seek to bring its technology to market via partnerships with established automakers.\n\nThere's just one problem: The automakers aren't exactly beating down Krafcik's door. In fact, the auto executives I've talked with feel that they have very good reasons to steer clear of a deal with Waymo, starting with control of the data generated by self-driving cars.\n\nIt's almost an understatement to say that automakers are very aware of the smartphone precedent. The phone makers that chose to adopt the Android operating system ended up making hardware on very slim margins. Alphabet ended up with most of the profits, because Android provided it with the (immensely valuable) users' data.\n\nAuto executives don't want to end up in the same boat, and they know that they'll soon have alternatives that will allow them to keep at least some control of the data. At least one alternative, a partnership between Delphi Automotive (NYSE: DLPH) , Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) , and Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY) , aims to have a self-driving system available to any automaker that wants it by the end of 2019. That partnership will allow automakers to retain much of the data, and auto executives see it as homegrown -- created largely by established industry suppliers, not by Silicon Valley hotshots.\n\nGiven that, why go with Waymo?\n\nThat said, a couple of big automakers have kicked the tires on Waymo's technology:\n\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU) worked with Google engineers last year to create the latest vehicles for Waymo's test fleet , based on the well-regarded Chrysler Pacifica minivan -- but there's no sign that the two will move forward on anything that could lead to a product for sale.\n\nHonda (NYSE: HMC) issued a somewhat odd announcement in December saying that it was \"entering into formal discussions\" with Waymo, though nothing (so far) seems to have resulted from those discussions. (I speculated at the time that Honda's announcement might have been about prodding other potential partners to take action . But at least as of right now, it's not clear exactly what was going on there.)\n\nWaymo may well find a profitable line of business in selling its sensors to other companies. And it's likely that some automaker, somewhere, will eventually give its self-driving system a try.\n\nBut unless other research and development efforts hit roadblocks that Waymo is somehow able to skirt, it seems unlikely that it will be a dominant player in self-driving systems anytime in the near future.\n\nThe upshot: Don't buy Alphabet just for self-driving\n\nThere are plenty of good reasons to consider adding Alphabet to your portfolio. But if you're looking for a targeted self-driving investment, Alphabet probably isn't it: As of right now, it's not clear that Waymo will ever add much to the search giant's bottom line.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company's quarterly revenue came in a $2.6 billion, which represents a decline of more than 2% from last year's figures.\n\nEven more concerning was the fact that online marketing customers declined 18.6% in 2016. For investors that consider BIDU to be the Chinese Google, that's a huge deal. Advertising dollars are everything to search engines like Baidu and Google.\n\nIt's Not as Bad as It Looks\n\nThose figures are certainly scary, but when you look at the reason behind them things start to look a little bit rosier. It's important to note that BIDU faced some major headwinds last year, including a big change to China's advertising regulations. The cost to comply with the new rules was significant for Baidu, which generates around 96% of its revenue from advertising.\n\nNot only did the new regulations hit BIDU's revenue hard, but they also hurt the firm's customers numbers. The new regulations include strict rules regarding how companies advertise and some of Baidu's current customers weren't able to meet those requirements, which resulted in a loss.\n\nHowever, there could be a silver lining in there for BIDU as the new requirements will help the firm identify who its quality customers are. If you look at per-customer spend, you'll see that those who were able to meet the new guidelines actually spent about 14% more than they had in the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\nHuge Growth Potential for BIDU Stock\n\nWhat's important to note here is that even if BIDU is struggling now, there is a huge growth opportunity for internet companies in China. While you might think that a search engine doesn't have room to expand any further, keep in mind that China is pretty far behind the U.S. when it comes to internet users. Just over 50% of the nation's population has access to the internet .\n\nThat's a big deal, because it means that as the internet makes its way further afield, advertisers are going to be willing to pay to reach even more people. Eventually, online advertising will be the best way to reach the majority of Chinese residents, and marketers will have to pay for that.\n\nBottom Line on BIDU Stock\n\nNot only does BIDU have a lot of growth potential in its core business, but the firm has been investing heavily in hot new technology like artificial intelligence and self-driving vehicles. While advertising revenue still makes up the bulk of Baidu's bottom line, we could see big-time benefits from the firm's focus on the future.\n\nThe company's efforts to develop self-driving technology are particularly enticing because the cars' navigation systems will be equipped to deal with China's complicated traffic conditions. That means that once the vehicles are roadworthy, tweaking their technology to make them usable on U.S. roads will be far easier than trying to do it the other way around.\n\nBIDU's fourth-quarter results were definitely scary on the surface, but things aren't as bad as the market would have you believe. If you have ever considered buying BIDU stock, now is the time to do it.\n\nAs of this writing, Laura Hoy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Buy the Baidu Inc (ADR) (BIDU) Stock Dip appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "A while ago someone noticed that if you took the first letters of the names of the four big modern tech companies, Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google (GOOG:GOOGL) they spelled out a wonderful acronym, FANG. Of course, since then Google has gone and spoiled it all by rebranding their holding company as alphabet, but the acronym has stuck.\n\nAt the risk of spoiling that alphabetic synergy I would add Apple (AAPL) to the list, given that companies role as the largest of the tech stocks. In fact some people substitute Apple for Amazon and obviously if you do that you still get FANG rather than the less appealing FAANG. For argument’s sake, let’s assume that all five stocks are still collectively known as the fang stocks, and right now they look like a good place to be.\n\nThe reason, though, is less about tech, or indeed about business at all, than it is about politics. The market seems to be driven at the moment by what comes out of the White House. Since the election there has been a lot of faith placed by traders and investors in certain policies outlined by the new administration and the Republicans who dominate Congress during the campaign; a “beautiful” replacement for Obamacare, for example, as well as tax reform and infrastructure spending.\n\nYesterday’s drop in the stock market, the biggest of the year so far, was reportedly triggered by worries about the healthcare bill slated to replace the Affordable Care Act. It has met with opposition from within the Republican Party, particularly from the Right, and needs some serious negotiation in order to just pass the House.\n\nThat in itself would be a bad thing if repeal went ahead without the replacement passed, as most acknowledge that something has to fill the vacuum.\n\nMore worrying for the market, though, is that if this bill fails, it will indicate that the fiscal conservatives in Congress are sticking to their principles, making stimulative infrastructure spending a virtual non-starter.\n\nSome of the biggest losers yesterday were in the industrial and material sectors that have gained the most since the election and which would be hurt most by delays in infrastructure spending. The reason the fang stocks look so attractive right now is because policy delays regarding healthcare and infrastructure spending will have little effect on them in the short term, but things like tax reform when it does come, especially the possibility of the repatriation of overseas profits, will make an enormous difference. The consensus is that tax reform is an area that unites the party and thus could be even hastened by a split over the Obamacare replacement.\n\nThe fly in the ointment could be that much of the potential growth for these firms lies in overseas expansion, in particular to emerging economies. That would be a worry if the White House does push for more isolationist trade relationships, but again the fact that the Freedom Caucus free market types in the GOP are flexing their muscles would suggest that any eventual move would have to be negotiated, and therefore moderated from the campaign rhetoric.\n\nAll in all, then, things look good for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. That belief seems to have taken hold today as each of the tech big five has bucked the downward trend of the broader market and gained in early trading. Of course one swallow doth not a summer make, but the logic behind these stocks’ contrarian behavior is hard to refute and they may prove to be a hedge against politics driven uncertainty over the next few weeks, or even months.", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPeople are always on the lookout for the next industry Amazon.com, Inc.

AMZN stock takes no prisoners, and the company is responsible for much of the pain felt today by brick-and-mortar retailers such as J C Penney Company Inc (NYSE: JCP ) and Sears Holdings Corp (NASDAQ: SHLD ).\n\nBanks know that tech companies like Amazon and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) hold some advantages. Millennials are more likely to trust tech companies than banks. Also, tech companies can operate at lower costs than banks, since they don't have branches. A McKinsey report found that the lack of branches gives fintech lenders a 400-basis-point advantage over banks. Tech giants also have lower customer acquisition costs and greater digital competency than banks.\n\nIt looks like Amazon stock is deepening its involvement in finance. AMZN already began offering loans to sellers on its online marketplace in 2012, and expanded this to eight more countries , including Germany and China, in 2015. And Amazon rolled out a payments service in 2013, which doubled in transaction value in 2016 and reached 33 million customers.\n\nIn the near-term, it looks like AMZN stock will focus on doing two things: building its payment system and cross-selling financial products from banks to its millions of users.\n\nIn the long-term, Amazon stock could end up as a major force in finance. As Huy Nguyen Trieu , a fintech expert and former Citi MD, writes: \"the tech giants such as Amazon, Google or Apple will continue their expansion into financial services and are likely to play an important role in the financial ecosystem - in the same way that Alibaba has done in China.\"\n\nThe venture capitalist Alex Rampell sees Amazon succeeding in finance as well. Alphabet, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), earn high margins from monetizing data or selling computer products, and this might deter them from entering finance . However, AMZN stock does not fear low-margin businesses.\n\nWill Amazon Stock Dominate the Payments Game?\n\nCurrently, Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL ) dominates online payments in the United States, with 200 million active accounts worldwide. The number of PayPal users dwarfs those of Amazon Payments by a factor of six. PayPal also holds an advantage over Amazon Pay in that other retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT ) and Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT ) do not want to take Amazon Pay , fearing that the data might give Amazon a competitive advantage. PayPal, on the other hand, is just a payments service, and doesn't compete with retailers like Walmart.\n\nCurrently, Amazon and PayPal are in talks to allow users to pay with PayPal on Amazon. Amazon's competitor eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY ) owned PayPal until the two split in 2015. Now, the two are free to work together.\n\nAnd the two will both benefit . This would increase PayPal's presence and drive business for PayPal, which has been absent from Amazon. And infrequent AMZN users might not want to put down a credit card on the site, so adding PayPal reduces friction.\n\nBut the truce between Amazon stock and PayPal might not last forever. AMZN could license its next-generation Amazon Go store technology to brick-and-mortar retailers in exchange for them allowing Amazon Pay.\n\nAs Andrew Melville notes in Forbes:\n\n\"Few retailers, even those worried about competition from Amazon, would be able to decline a free next-generation technology that would transform the customer experience, reduce theft, and allow for major reductions in labor - the second largest expense in retail. And no payments company would be able to offer retailers anything even remotely like Amazon Go's technology.\"\n\nMore grocery stores might then accept payment via Amazon Pay, helping AMZN's mobile wallet gain critical mass. And, as Alipay has shown in China, once Amazon gains ground in payments, it can build a broader internet finance ecosystem.\n\nAMZN Stock: Opportunities for Cross-Selling Financial Products\n\nAmazon could also partner with banks to provide its users with financial services such as loans.\n\nLast year, AMZN partnered with Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC ) to offer student loans at discounted rates to Amazon Student Prime subscribers. Student Prime subscribers could get a 0.5% discount on loans. However, Amazon quickly ended this amid public pressure from consumer watchdogs.\n\nThis January, Amazon announced the new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature credit card, issued through JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ). This card gives customers 5% cashback on purchases from AMZN and eliminates fees for foreign transactions. This further encourages shopping on Amazon and makes Prime membership more attractive, while giving Chase income from transactions.\n\nAmazon and the Banks\n\nIt looks like the relationship between AMZN stock and the banks will be complicated. In some areas, Amazon and the banks will be partners, with banks issuing financial products sold on its website to Prime subscribers. At the same time, AMZN will be a supplier to the banks, providing them with cloud services via Amazon Web Services .\n\nIn other cases, they may end up as competitors. Mobile wallets such as Amazon Pay could potentially replace credit cards, and deprive banks of payment revenues and data on customer spending patterns.\n\nAnd in these partnerships, who would have the upper hand? banks or Amazon stock? Remember, AMZN would be interacting directly with customers and holding the user data.\n\nAlthough the relationship between tech companies and banks is nuanced, banks still have reason to be concerned.\n\nAs of writing, Lucas Hahn did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Why the Next Frontier for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Could Be Finance appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "My article on Tuesday, which highlighted ( some might say “boasted” ) the recent achievements of Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ), was perceived by some readers as an attack on Intel ( INTC ). But that was the intent.\n\nWhile I’m admittedly an unabashed cheerleader of Intel, I can still appreciate the rags-to-riches story that AMD CEO Lisa Su has successfully executed since her appointment in January 2012. AMD stock traded at $5.40 at the time. The stock recently made a 52-week high of $15.55. Save for the people at AMD headquarters, no one anticipated this remarkable turnaround. But what’s good for AMD is also good for Intel since a excitement surrounding chip battles increases consumer interest.\n\nNotably, this renewed battle comes even as the rate of PC revenue continues to decline. In other words, both companies, which struggled at the height of the mobile era, have moved beyond being just PC shops. And while AMD continues to make impressive leaps, Intel is still the leader. The extent to which AMD pushes Intel to innovate, the better off Intel will be. And that’s exactly what Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has begun to demonstrate.\n\nLooking to avoid the another mobile-type miss, Intel is pushing heavily to be future-ready. Fresh off its second mega-deal in less than two years, Krzanich — in his fifth year at the helm — seems intent on putting Intel’s cash to use. The company’s $15.3 billion acquisition of Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye ( MBLY ) was the most recent example. This follows $16.7 billion deal for Altera back in 2015.\n\nThese two deals suggest that Intel is not worried about what AMD is doing. It can be argued that it should. But Krzanich, who has found ways to get Intel’s top line growing again, has shown to have a good pulse on what the company needs. Not only does Intel, thanks to Altera, now have an inside track on the Internet of Things and data center market, Mobileye now puts Intel in the driver's seat in the realm of autonomous cars, allowing it to better compete with Tesla ( TSLA ) and Google ( GOOGL ).\n\nIn both acquisitions, however, market pundits, who were unable to immediately see the financial benefits, criticize Intel for overpaying. But, recall, Google was laughed at for buying YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion. Today YouTube is worth an estimated $40 billion today. Likewise, Facebook ( FB ) was criticized for taking out Instagram. But assuming Intel can realize the estimated $70 billion total addressable market of driverless cars by 2030, Mobileye could prove to be a bargain.\n\nIn short, AMD’s improvements don’t spell the doom of Intel. The management of both companies are executing on their stated operating objectives. And both stocks should perform well in the next 12 to 18 months. As to which stock is right for you? That all depends on where your allegiance is.", "Shutterstock photo\n\n\n\n\n\n(RTTNews.com) - Offensive and extremist content appearing along with display ads has been creating headache for Google.

That's because GOOGL stock has something that a lot of other high-growth dynamos simply don't have:\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAny value left whatsoever.\n\nI'm prudent when it comes to hyper-growth stocks such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ). I've missed out on some great runs as a result, but I also haven't gotten burned when growth flags. Instead, I prefer to focus on \"growth at a reasonable price,\" or GARP - and I believe GOOGL stock falls into this category.\n\nGo With GARP\n\nWith growth stocks, I look for a price-to-earnings ratio of a stock that is no more than 2x its earnings growth rate, if earnings are growing at 15% annually or more. And I want to back out stock buyback effects. To me, a GARP stock has a PEG ratio of 1.0, though I'll allow up to 1.5 depending on the earnings growth rate.\n\nGOOGL stock trades at 29x FY16 earnings and about 21x FY17 earnings. Analysts see five-year annualized growth at 19.2%. So on the surface, Alphabet seems to qualify as a GARP pick.\n\nBut there's even more good news.\n\nThis doesn't consider the net cash position of GOOGL stock. See, I value a company net of its net cash hoard, just as Peter Lynch used to do. With $86.4 billion on its balance sheet, that pulls the market cap for Alphabet down to about $480 billion.\n\nOn $19.5 billion in net income for FY16, we suddenly find that Alphabet stock trades at 24.6 times FY16 earnings and only about 17.5 times FY17 earnings.\n\nThat's the first step for me in even determining if GOOGL stock is a stock to get involved in.\n\nHow Is Alphabet's Business?\n\nThe next thing I examine is how healthy Alphabet Inc's actual businesses are.\n\nI still don't like the idea that GOOGL is basically a giant digital advertising billboard with a venture capital arm. However, I can't deny that Google's search engine holds an astonishing 80.47% market share . As long as four out of every five searches are conducted on Google, advertisers will throw money at Alphabet. There would have to be a scandal of monumental proportions, or some incredibly innovative new method of searching, to change this significantly.\n\nAlphabet's 17% year-over-year increase in advertising revenue to $22.4 billion comes as no surprise.\n\nSo next I look at the YOY metrics, which look fantastic Aggregate paid clicks up 36%, paid clicks on Google properties up 43%, and paid clicks on Network properties up 7%. A lot of people freaked out that cost-per-click fell 15%, 16% and 19% for each of the above categories, respectively. The market doesn't seem to realize that this is because more advertising is being pushed to mobile.\n\nAs for Other Bets, which is basically the company's VC arm, I don't love that it blew a billion dollars in the quarter. But considering free cash flow was $6.33 billion, and net cash is $86.4 billion, GOOGL has that money to spend. With portfolio strategy, all it takes is one of these VC bets to hit, and all that money spent will be made back and more.\n\nThis brief glance tells me that Alphabet is an advertising business with dominant market share that is literally printing money. I mean, it generated $26 billion in free cash flow in FY16. That's free cash flow, meaning it can do whatever it wants with it.\n\nThat's even after spending about $10 billion in capex.\n\nBottom Line on GOOGL Stock\n\nNormally, I would continue to examine other parts of the business if I were looking to include GOOGL in something like my forthcoming stock advisory newsletter, The Liberty Portfolio .\n\nBut for right now, I see enough to suggest investors continue their own due diligence and strongly consider GOOGL stock as a GARP play.\n\nLawrence Meyers is the CEO of PDL Capital, and manager of the forthcoming Liberty Portfolio stock newsletter.

But it's only now, this year, that the clock really starts ticking. At some time within the next 10 and a half months, one company must succeed in achieving XPRIZE's three key stated requirements -- or forfeit its chance to win the $20 million purse for placing first.\n\nSometime in 2017, someone will land on the Moon. Bet on it. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFirst thing's first\n\nIn case you haven't been paying attention to the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition, let's bring you up to date. So far, $5.25 million in prizes have been doled out to teams demonstrating \"milestone\" capabilities in the skills of conducting lunar landings, moving about on the lunar surface, and lunar imaging.\n\nStill up for grabs is the grand prize -- $20 million for being the first team to successfully land on the Moon, travel at least 500 meters from the landing site, and transmit two high-definition \"Mooncasts\" back to Earth. The second team to complete all three missions will receive $5 million, and then there are up to $17 million in additional prizes for accomplishing various add-on missions (e.g., conducting a Mooncast from the Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, or 17 landing sites, keeping a rover alive and functioning for at least two days, or finding water on the Moon).\n\nBut to win any share at all of this loot, someone has to land on the Moon -- and someone has to be first.\n\nRound up some unusual suspects\n\nWho will the winner be? I've already introduced you to two of the leading contenders:\n\nIsraeli start-up SpaceIL, which has contracted with Spaceflight Industries for room aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to carry its spacecraft and lander to the Moon.\n\nAnd America's own Moon Express , the first company to receive U.S. government approval to land on the Moon (with a little help from Rocket Lab's Electron rocket, which will be carrying it up there).\n\nBoth these rivals have set launch dates vaguely in the \"late 2017\" range, ensuring this race will go down to the wire. As for the other participants, last month, XPRIZE announced the remaining three finalists ready to take a shot at the Moon. These include:\n\nSynergy Moon, an international alliance among the Human Synergy Project, California-based Interplanetary Ventures, British satcom company RPC Telecommunications, and American aerospace manufacturer Interorbital Systems. Interorbital will provide the rocket for this team -- a NEPTUNE 8 launch vehicle launching from sea, off the California coast, sometime later this year.\n\nTeam Indus, flying aboard an ISRO space agency PSLV rocket from India before attempting to land an \"ECA\" moon rover.\n\nAnd finally, Japanese competitor Hakuto, an eclectic team backed by everyone from Japanese space agency JAXA to Suzuki to a rock band called \"Sakanaction.\"\n\nCuriously, both Indus and Hakuto will ride the same PSLV rocket to the Moon, and land their rovers on the same lander. This could make it difficult deciding which one lands \"first\" and gets the big $20 million prize. But seeing as they have to land on the Moon successfully before they encounter this dilemma, figuring out who arrived first will be a nice problem to have once they get there. Indus and Hakuto plan to launch their XPRIZE mission on Dec. 28, 2017.\n\nWhat it means to investors\n\n$20 million, $30 million, $40 million -- however much prize money Google ultimately antes up for the winners, it's unlikely that any of these teams will make much of a profit from running the first privately funded Moon landing. But that's not the point.\n\nFirst and foremost, the point will be earning bragging rights for accomplishing something no nongovernmental agency -- not even SpaceX -- has ever done before: landing a spacecraft on the Moon. And as we saw when privately held Scaled Composites won the Ansari XPRIZE back in 2004 -- and was later bought out by Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) , which had previously owned only a minority stake -- just placing first in an XPRIZE competition could make a company more attractive to would-be acquirers.\n\nOf greater import to investors, though, is what comes after someone successfully lands a spacecraft on the Moon. Proving the mission is feasible will almost certainly invite imitation by larger companies, and with any luck, publicly traded companies that we can invest in ourselves. It will open up not just a new market, but literally a whole new world of opportunities for those who follow the trail blazed by this year's space pioneers. All we need now is for someone to take that first step.\n\nAnd by Dec. 31, 2017, we should know who that will be.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Northrop Grumman\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It's a very big deal that has huge implications for GM, Lyft, and their rivals.\n\nWhat the report said\n\nAccording to the Reuters article, GM will build thousands of Chevy Bolts equipped with prototype versions of the self-driving system GM has developed with its subsidiary, Cruise Automation. Most of these self-driving Bolts will go into ride-hailing service with Lyft in several states starting sometime in 2018.\n\nGM has no plans right now to sell the self-driving Bolts to the general public.\n\nCEO Mary Barra announced in December that GM would begin producing self-driving Chevrolet Bolt test vehicles in early 2017. Image source: General Motors.\n\nWhat it would mean for GM\n\nGM has been working on self-driving technology for years. That work seemed to take a big leap forward with the acquisition of San Francisco-based start-up Cruise Automation early last year. It appears that Cruise has since become the center of GM's research efforts. Cruise's self-driving Chevy Bolt test cars have become regular sights on San Francisco streets, and recent videos taken from inside self-driving Bolt test cars suggest that the GM/Cruise technology is at a fairly advanced level . GM announced in December that it would soon begin producing self-driving Bolt test vehicles, but the hint was that -- at least in the near term -- they'd be produced in small quantities for GM's own testing.\n\nA mass deployment would demonstrate two things: First, that GM's technology really is at a high level, and second, that GM and its supplier partners are ready and able to mass-produce self-driving cars.\n\nBoth of those things are significant. Taken together, it would be a strong argument that GM is leading the way to mass-produced Level 4 self-driving vehicles. Companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have attracted a lot of investor attention for (among other things) their self-driving efforts, but -- as of right now, at least -- GM seems poised to leapfrog just about everybody.\n\nWhat it would mean for Lyft\n\nLyft, like its larger rival Uber Technologies, knows that replacing its human drivers with self-driving vehicles is crucial to its future. Autonomous ride-hailing vehicles will allow Lyft to lower its prices while generating (hopefully) strong profits.\n\nUber has been working on its own self-driving technology for a couple of years, and has a few prototype self-driving test cars in service now. Lyft isn't known to have done any work on a self-driving system of its own, but it doesn't need to: GM owns a 9% stake in Lyft, and GM seems to have it handled.\n\nIf Lyft beats Uber to a self-driving fleet at scale, Uber will have a big challenge on its hands.\n\nGM president Dan Ammann (center) with Lyft co-founders Logan Green (left) and John Zimmer. GM owns 9% of the ride-hailing company, and Ammann is a member of its board of directors. Image source: General Motors.\n\nCould this be for real?\n\nThe Reuters report, by veteran auto-business journalist Paul Lienert, cites two unnamed \"sources familiar with the automaker's plans.\" Generally, investors (and everyone else) should take reports based on information from unnamed sources with a grain or two of salt. But a few things suggest to me that this is probably for real.\n\nFirst, Lienert is a veteran with good sources, and Reuters holds its reporting to high standards. Second, the report fits with the known facts: GM and Lyft have both said that a test of autonomous GM vehicles in Lyft service is forthcoming . Third, GM's Orion, Michigan, factory, where the Bolt is built, has plenty of capacity to do a special production run in the thousands.\n\nFinally, and most tellingly, neither Lyft nor GM denied the report. In fact, GM's statement in response was almost a smiling hint:\n\nWe do not provide specific details on potential future products or technology rollout plans. We have said that our AV technology will appear in an on-demand ride sharing network application sooner than you might think . [Emphasis added.]\n\nTranslation: This is likely to happen, and it might begin sooner than 2018.\n\nHow important is this for GM investors?\n\nIf it happens, it will be a big deal. While the idea of a \"race\" to self-driving technology isn't really useful to investors , a big test like this next year (or sooner) will show that GM isn't about to be disrupted by Silicon Valley when it comes to self-driving. It will also give lots of people an opportunity to experience self-driving technology firsthand, which will almost certainly speed its adoption by increasing consumer demand.\n\nIf nothing else, it seems very likely to attract investors' attention and give GM shares a boost.\n\n10 stocks we like better than General Motors\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here are some rules to help you build a bigger nest egg with an IRA.\n\nWhat are IRAs?\n\nAs a refresher, you can get big tax benefits by saving money for retirement in a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA.\n\nIn 2017, you can set aside up to $5,500 of your earnings in either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA or a combination of the two. If you're 50 years old or older, then you can save up to $6,500 of your earnings in an IRA.\n\nIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.\n\nTraditional IRAs can be funded with pre-tax money, which means that money you put in now isn't taxed at your current tax rate. Instead, that money, and any future gains, are taxed when its withdrawn. Because of this feature, traditional IRAs can make sense if you think your income tax rate in retirement will be lower than it is today.\n\nAlternatively, Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax money, which means you're paying taxes on your contributions now so that you can withdraw them -- and future gains -- tax-free in retirement. Because of up-front taxation, a Roth IRA can make sense if you expect your income tax rate in retirement to be higher than it is today.\n\nSome important IRA withdrawal rules\n\nIn the case of a traditional IRA, if you don't wait until you're at least 59.5 years old, the IRS will charge you income taxes on any money that you withdraw, plus a 10% penalty, unless you qualify for an early withdrawal exemption (more on that in a minute).\n\nIn the case of a Roth IRA, you can withdraw your contributions tax-free at any age without a penalty, as long as the Roth IRA has been established for at least five years. However, any gains that you withdraw prior to reaching age 59.5 can be subject to income tax and penalties.\n\nBoth traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs do allow penalty free, early withdrawals in specific instances. A full list of these exemptions can be found here , but the big ones to know about include purchasing a first home (up to $10,000), or paying college tuition for you, or an immediate relative, such as a spouse or child. The rules for taking advantage of these exemptions can be quite complex, so make sure you consult a tax professional before taking any early withdrawals. After all, the last thing you want is a surprise at tax time!\n\nOverall, a Roth IRA might be a better option if you think you'll need to withdraw contributions five or more years from now, and you won't be 59.5 years old or qualify for an early withdrawal exemption at that time.\n\nNavigating the IRA income caps\n\nIn order to qualify for a tax deduction on a traditional IRA contribution, your modified adjusted gross income has to be below set limits if you, or your spouse, are covered by a retirement plan at work. Similarly, in order to contribute to a Roth IRA, your modified adjusted gross income needs to be below set limits too.\n\nRecently, fellow Motley Fool Matthew Frankel did a great job at explaining adjusted income limits for IRA's here , but in short, if you're single and you are covered by a retirement plan at work, you can take the full deduction on a traditional IRA contribution if your adjusted income is below $62,000 in 2017. You can qualify for a partial deduction if your adjusted income is between $62,000 and $72,000.\n\nIf you're single, you can make a contribution to a Roth IRA as long as your adjusted income is less than $118,000. You can make a partial contribution if your adjusted income is between $118,000 and $133,000.\n\nIf you're married filing jointly and covered by a retirement plan at work, then you can take a tax deduction on your traditional IRA contribution, as long as your adjusted income is below $99,000. A partial deduction is possible if your adjusted income is between $99,000 and $119,000.\n\nIf you're not covered by a plan at work but your spouse is, then you can make a tax deductible contribution to traditional IRA if your adjusted income is below $186,000 or a partial deduction if your adjusted income is between $186,000 and $196,000.\n\nIf you're married filing jointly, you can contribute to a Roth IRA as long as your adjusted income is below $184,000. A partial contribution can be made if your income is between $184,000 and $194,000.\n\nIf you think you're close to these limits and you're unsure of how to calculate your modified adjusted gross income, you can read up on the subject here .\n\nHow to invest in an IRA\n\nOnce you've contributed to an IRA, you'll need to pick some investments. There are a lot of choices, and you'll want to think carefully about your age, your health, and the number of years you have until you begin withdrawals.\n\nIf you're young, in good health, and have plenty of years to ride out the inevitable recession, then an IRA that includes stocks, stock ETFs, and stock mutual funds can make sense. Usually, buying and holding stocks and ETFs for long periods of time is cheaper than buying an actively managed mutual fund, so make sure that you balance the potential return, risk, and expenses associated with these choices.\n\nSome investors may prefer owning individual stocks for the long term, such as disruptive growth companies like Amazon or Alphabet . Other investors may prefer owning an S&P 500 ETF that tracks the stock market's returns more closely. If so, a low-cost S&P 500 ETF that might fit the bill is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) . It has an annual expense ratio of just 0.05%.\n\nIt may also pay off to own dividend-paying stocks in an IRA. Because IRAs offer tax advantages, dividend payments can compound over time tax-deferred, or in the case of a Roth IRA, potentially tax-free. Historically, dividend-paying stocks have outperformed non-dividend-paying stocks. However, the performance of dividend stocks tends to be lower during periods of rising interest rates, when they have to compete with bonds for income investors' attention.\n\nOverall, building a diversified IRA that includes exposure to stocks and stock ETFs can provide financial security in retirement. For example, if you're 30, and you contribute $5,500 per year for 35 years and earn a hypothetical 6% return per year, then you'll have a nest egg valued at $612,886 at age 65. That's not chump change, so make sure that you take advantage of this powerful savings tool.\n\nThe $16,122 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\n\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $16,122 more... each year! Once you learn how to maximize your Social Security benefits, we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after.

Alphabet Inc <GOOG.O> has dropped out of the fund's top-10 holdings list after the $41 billionBlackRock Global Allocation Fund <MALOX.O> <MCLOX.O> pared back its near-half-billion-dollar stake in the parent of the leading search engine in January. Last year, Alphabet C-class shares worth about 1 percent of the fund's total assets were on its top-10 list. The Global Allocation Fund holds hundreds of stocks and also invests in bonds. The C-class shares have no voting rights. Alphabet's A-class shares <GOOGL.O> were not a top-10 holding of the fund. As of Jan. 31, the list still included other tech innovators, such as Apple Inc <AAPL.O>, Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O>, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Facebook Inc <FB.O>, according to BlackRock's website. Global Allocation held about $443 million in Alphabet C-class shares, as of Oct. 31, down from $550 million the prior quarter, according to regulatory filings. The fund has held the stock since October 2015, according to Morningstar Inc. The latest disclosures do not make clear how much of the Alphabet stake has been sold. The 10th-largest Global Allocation holding, Pfizer Inc <PFE.N>, accounted for about 0.58 percent of the fund, which would work out to $237 million, suggesting the Google stake had fallen at least to that level. Alphabet did not respond to requests for comment. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, declined to comment. \"Our enthusiasm for U.S. stocks is tempered by elevated valuations, a lack of fiscal policy specifics, and uncertainty regarding future U.S. trade policy,\" the fund's managers wrote in a summary covering their January trades. \"We reduced the fund's exposure to select technology stocks, including U.S.-based companies that generate a significant portion of revenues from non-U.S. dollar sources.\" Alphabet earned 53 percent of its revenue outside of the United States last year, according to its earnings statements. The value was reduced by the U.S. dollar's strength against the British pound, euro and other currencies. U.S. President Donald Trump has touted a series of trade and tax reforms to boost domestic growth, some of which could also push up the U.S. dollar. A Republican proposal to reform taxes that would levy a 20 percent tax on imports and exclude export revenue from taxable income has been circulating. Trump has said he would announce his own tax plan in coming weeks.

More and more customers are showing interest in over-the-top streaming TV services. Over 200,000 people joined AT&T 's(NYSE: T) DirecTVNow in about one month. DISH Network 's(NASDAQ: DISH) Sling TV has over 1 million subscribers. Sony 's(NYSE: SNE) PlayStation Vue is also very popular.\n\nNow YouTube -- a subsidiary of Google, the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company -- is throwing its hat in the ring as well. The company recently revealed YouTube TV, a slightly differentiated television service that costs just $35 per month.\n\nHere's what investors need to know about YouTube TV.\n\nYouTube TV's channel lineup. Image source: YouTube\n\nIt's missing a lot of traditional cable networks\n\nYouTube focused on signing deals with the big four broadcast companies. As a result, cable-only media companies such as Viacom and Time Warner are missing from the bundle. No CNN, Comedy Central, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, or HBO. But it does mean cable networks owned by the big four -- ESPN, FX, USA, E!, and so on -- are all there.\n\nThat's kind of the opposite approach of Sling TV. Sling launched without any broadcast networks, inviting subscribers to buy a television antenna to supplement the service.\n\nImportantly, local networks are limited in availability. That's why YouTube TV is launching only in markets where the media companies own the local broadcast affiliate. Sony tried something similar before expanding nationwide with a reduced price for subscribers where live local channels are not available.\n\nOverall, the channel lineup is somewhat lacking compared with competing services at around the same price point. Customers that signed up early for DirecTV Now are receiving 100 channels for $35 per month, and new customers can still receive 60 channels for that price. PlayStation Vue customers can get a similar set of channels for $35 per month, and Sling TV subscribers can get around 50 channels for $40 per month.\n\nThe limited geographical reach and channel lineup should reduce the number of subscribers YouTube TV will attract.\n\nYouTube is a veteran at video streaming\n\nAlthough YouTube TV may lack some of the content available on other platforms at similar price points and the geographic reach of its competition, it has one major advantage. It already owns leading technology in video streaming.\n\nAll three of the aforementioned competitors suffered major technical difficulties following their launches. DirecTV Now received a lot of bad press as its servers were overloaded making parts or all of the service unusable. YouTube, on the other hand, already streaming 1 billion hours of video every day.\n\nConsumers may be willing to sacrifice some channels for more reliable service. But YouTube still has to prove that it can deliver where competitors failed.\n\nThe bottom line for investors\n\nYouTube TV is a somewhat underwhelming product at launch. With a limited channel lineup and geographic reach, it's unlikely to make any significant impact on YouTube's operations in the near term.\n\nIn the long term, however, getting a viable product out there now could lead to a much better product in the future. YouTube is already offering a few differentiating features such as unlimited cloud DVR, AI powered search and personalization (likely backed by YouTube viewer data), and the ability to split the account six ways so different users get different recommendations. If YouTube can get the content deals in place while maintaining competitive pricing, it could be a big winner in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (C shares)\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

They even once labeled it as \"a YouTube killer.\" I bet Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) management wasn't too worried then. That exuberance marked the top for GoPro stock.\n\nSource: ETC-USC via Flickr (Modified)\n\nNow, GoPro stock gets a downgrade under $9 per share. I'm sure it's no coincidence that this coincides with the IPO of Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP ), which had a successful offering last week. Money is probably flocking out of GPRO and into SNAP stock, perhaps to recoup some losses there.\n\nI think the two have little in common. GoPro stock is a play on a line of action cameras known for being rugged and for active outdoorsy people. We see videos of extreme base jumping pros to teens clearing a two-foot hedge in their front yard. So far, SNAP appears to capture more general scenarios.\n\nThe hate for GoPro stock should abate eventually. It still has cool products with very few high-profile direct competitors. I don't have a lot of faith in management, but just like in the case of Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ), I think someone will eventually figure the stock out. But for this morning, GPRO stock is down 7.8% on a downgrade from Goldman Sachs.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge Based on that logic, I want to risk a little on a speculative trade going long GPRO stock. I could risk $8 to buy the stock, but instead I will use the options markets to risk even less. My thesis relies on GoPro stock eventually becoming attractive to old fans who revalue their re-entry levels.\n\nI do have to note that GPRO is in danger of inviting more technical sellers if it loses these lows. So I will snipe out the entry, perhaps in two tranches.\n\nThe Bet: Sell the GPRO Jan 2018 $5/$3 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 50 cents to open per contract. If successful, this trade would yield over 30% on money risked. I need GPRO stock to stay above my sold spread to win.\n\nYes, it is a gamble to try and catch falling knives, especially one like GPRO. But I need to add a few speculative plays to my portfolio, and this one qualifies. Again, an underlying assumption is that GoPro will eventually survive. But I don't need it to thrive to profit.\n\nUsually, I like to balance my risk by selling upside risk. In this case, however, I won't. GoPro stock has fallen too far, too fast, and I would be selling risk at a severe discount. If GPRO bounced hard, I would face self-inflicted risk against my own thesis.\n\nI could juice my bet by buying upside calls, but I will wait out a few more trading hours to flush out an interim bottom. I don't want to turn this trade into an investment yet, however, since I've already said that I don't have much faith in GPRO management's ability.\n\nI am not required to hold my options trade option through their expiration. I can close them at any time for partial gains or losses.\n\nNicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com .

Time to Go Long! appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Reuters\n\nUPDATE 1-Investor group seeks to bar Snap from indexes over voting rights\n\n\n\n(Adds details on disclosure changes by Snap) By Ross KerberBOSTON, March 6 (Reuters) - A group representing large institutional investors has approached index providers S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI Inc, looking to bar Snap Inc <SNAP.N> and any other company that sells investors non-voting shares from their stock benchmarks. Both index providers have said they are reviewing Snap's inclusion. Were Snap to be added to indexes such as the S&P 500 Index or the MSCI USA Index, managers of stock index portfolios would have to buy its shares, and other investors whose performance is tracked against such indexes would likely follow suit. Some money managers worry about buying Snap's Class A shares because they have no voting rights, meaning those shareholders will have no voice on matters like company strategy or executive pay. \"They're tapping public markets but giving public shareholders no say,\" said Amy Borrus, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents pension funds and other large asset owners, in an interview. In reaching out to both index providers, she said, \"What we would like to see at the least is for the indexes to exclude new no-vote companies.\" Meetings with both index providers are scheduled this week, she said. David Blitzer, managing director of S&P Dow Jones Indices and chair of a committee overseeing its indexes, said they would not add a new stock like Snap for six to 12 months after its IPO in any case, and will use that time to study Snap's structure. While the index provider does not have a hard requirement about a company's voting structure, the committee needs to think through how much influence investors should have, Blitzer said in an interview on Monday. \" 'Who Votes?' is the issue right now,\" he said. MSCI <MSCI.N> said on March 2 that Snap would qualify for indexes including the MSCI USA Index, but said on March 3 that after additional analysis Snap did not meet all requirements. Snap's inclusion into the MSCI USA Index will be re-assessed in May, MSCI said in a statement on its website. MSCI is seeking feedback from investors about whether companies without voting rights should be included in indexes, according to the March 3 statement. A spokesman did not immediately provide further details. A spokesman for Snap declined to comment. Snap's $3.4 billion initial public offering last week marked the hottest technology IPO in three years. Investors snapped up shares of the Venice, California company, even though its two co-founders retained near total control. The situation alarms some big investors who fear other companies might copy Snap's structure. Other S&P 500 companies like Facebook <FB.O> and Google parent Alphabet <GOOG.O> also have non-voting shares but still grant voting rights with other widely traded shares. After the council raised concerns about Snap's lack of voting rights last month, Snap's chairman Michael Lynton wrote back on Feb. 21 to point out a section of its prospectus stating the voting structure \"prolongs our ability to remain a founder-led company\" and that Snap will have a majority-independent board, including himself. Index inclusion requirements vary. For the S&P 500 a stock typically needs a market capitalization of around $5.5 billion and to have been profitable over the past four quarters, for instance, Blitzer said. Snap's lack of voting rights was outlined in a registration statement Feb 2. The company filed amended versions of the document during the month, ultimately including more notice that investors might receive limited information. The company also specified Class A investors would be invited to attend its annual meeting. Spokespeople for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Snap declined to comment on the reasons for the new language. But the changes resembled those typically added in response to questions by the SEC, said David Berger, an attorney for the Palo Alto, California law firm Wilson Sonsini, who advises companies on corporate governance, via email. The agency often asks for more disclosure on issues it thinks would be important to investors. \"Often at the top of that list is information about the rights of shareholders,\" Berger said. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Lacking voting rights, Snap IPO to test fund governance talk http://reut.rs/2lOQvCM Snap's shares pop after year's biggest IPO http://reut.rs/2lXBYrR ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> (Reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston.

This unique little company's stock jumped 62.7% in 2016, handily beating larger peers like 3M (NYSE: MMM) , as well as the S&P 500. But companies that defy description can sometimes be hidden buys.\n\nIf it's tough to describe Raven, it's even tougher to figure out where the company -- not to mention its stock -- is likely to head in 2017. That's partly due to a huge issue with the company that should worry investors who are interested in buying top-quality stocks.\n\nRaven Industries invented the modern hot air balloon. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat it does\n\nRaven Industries was formed in 1956, when a group of businessmen left General Mills , of all places, to form an industrial balloon company. Over the next few decades, Raven invented the modern hot air balloon and dabbled in other materials science industries like fiberglass tanks, parachutes, cold-weather sportswear, and utility truck bodies. The company branched out into the businesses of flow systems and agricultural control systems in the 80s and 90s.\n\nToday, Raven still manufactures balloons, covers, liners, and films used in various applications from grain covers to wastewater pit liners to industrial packaging. It also has robust agricultural controls and radar technologies businesses. The \"internet balloons\" developed by Alphabet 's Google to bring broadband access to rural areas utilize Raven's balloon technology.\n\nEven with its 2016 performance, Raven is still a small company, with a less than $1 billion market cap. So, let's look at how such a small-yet-diversified company managed to crush the market last year.\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nAs you might expect with a small-cap company, Raven's growth was very lumpy throughout 2016, in sharp contrast to the much larger 3M and the S&P:\n\nRAVN data by YCharts .\n\nBut as you can see, one of the biggest jumps of the year for the company came, unsurprisingly, in the wake of Donald Trump's upset win in the November election. Such a win was seen as a boon for construction companies because of a potential major infrastructure package, for defense contractors because of potential increases in military spending, and for energy companies because of the potential removal of environmental regulations.\n\nRaven Industries operates in all of those fields, manufacturing films for the construction industry, surveillance balloons and equipment for the military, and films to contain fracking waste. No wonder the market has high hopes for the company going into 2017.\n\nOf course, considering the amount of opposition on Capitol Hill to some of President Trump's policies and proposals, it would be a risky bet to buy Raven's stock solely on speculation about his agenda without more details about how it might be implemented -- and whether Congress is buying in to his proposals. But there's an even bigger risk for potential Raven investors.\n\nThe red flag\n\nRaven is in an unusual situation in that, as of early February, it was in non-compliance with NASDAQ rules for failure to submit quarterly reports to the SEC. Since then, the company has filed five quarterly SEC reports, including amended Q3 2016 and full-year 2016 reports, as well as an amended Q1 2017 report and Q2 and Q3 reports.\n\nThe company hadn't held an earnings conference call since March 2016, but it finally held one on February 16th. On that call, as you can imagine, there was a heaping helping of humble pie served up by CEO Dan Rhykus. \"I'd like to address our reevaluation of our internal control framework and the controlled deficiencies we identified,\" he began, before stating the following:\n\nWe are responding with the utmost urgency and diligence to remedy the situation and to ensure that we maintain a more proactive approach to adapting the changes in the future, so that our framework design appropriate adapts to whatever changes our business may experience in the future or to changes in the regulatory environment. As we work to remediate these material weaknesses and enhance our control's framework, we will keep you fully informed and updated.\n\nEssentially, management discovered that \"The Company's controls relating to the response to the risks of material misstatement were not effectively designed,\" according to the company's amended 2016 10-K. Specifically, these control issues could -- and did -- lead the company to misstate items including goodwill, long-lived assets, income taxes, and inventories on its quarterly and annual reports.\n\nWhile many of these misstatements were comparatively small -- selling, general, and administrative expenses, for example, were revised upwards by just $20,000 for FY 2016 -- some were far more significant. Long-lived asset impairment losses of $3.8 million, for example, weren't even included in the original 2016 10-K, and contributed to a $6.7 million drop in EBIT on the amended report. That in turn helped to drop annual EPS from $0.23 (original) to $0.13 (restated), a major change.\n\nWhat's of more concern than these identified issues, however, is the possibility that there are other problems that haven't yet come to light.\n\nInvestor takeaway\n\nThere's certainly a case to be made that -- with its reporting now up-to-date and with remediation efforts under way -- Raven's troubles are behind it, and it's a safe investment moving forward. Plus, the company's reported third-quarter earnings were actually pretty impressive . Operating income was up 175% year over year, for example. So maybe I'm being overly cautious when I say that I don't feel comfortable investing in Raven until it can provide concrete assurances that it has its house in order (remember, the company hasn't yet been able to guarantee the issues are solved).\n\nIn the third-quarter earnings call, Rhykus has promised to keep investors updated, so I'll be eagerly awaiting those updates. In the meantime, there are plenty of other companies that are generating strong earnings that don't seem to be having the internal problems that Raven is having. If you're interested in materials science stocks, you could consider 3M, despite its middling outlook . For now, though, cautious investors should probably look elsewhere.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Raven Industries\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And in the latest sign that the competition is far from over, Spotify just announced it has hit the 50 million paid subscriber mark.\n\nSpotify Hits 50 Million Paid Subscribers\n\nApple Music and Spotify are considered to be the two big players in the streaming music war.\n\nSpotify launched in 2008, giving it a long lead in which to build up steam over Apple Music, which didn't go live until 2015. Despite that head start - and predictions that after its initial free three-month trial expired, Apple's streaming music service would see a big drop off of subscribers - Apple Music quickly began to gain obliterate Spotify's numbers.\n\nApple Music hit 10 million paid subscribers after just six months, a milestone that took Spotify nearly six years to reach . Since then, Apple Music has continued to add paid subscribers at a rapid pace : 11 million by last February, 13 million in April, 17 million in September and 20 million in December.\n\nHowever, despite the rapidly increasing popularity of Apple's streaming music service, Spotify stubbornly refuses to go away. In fact, rather than stalling or beginning to slip as many expected, Spotify's numbers have also been growing strongly.\n\nSpotify had roughly 20 million paid subscribers at the time Apple Music launched. This week, the company announced it has hit 50 million .\n\nIn other words, Spotify is not going anywhere any time soon.\n\nA Little More Competition\n\nWhile the big streaming music battle has been between Apple Music and Spotify, many other competitors are duking it out for the dollars of music fans. And rather than scare off new entrants, the success of Apple Music led to a big new competitor taking a shot at the business.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) launched Amazon Music Unlimited last fall , matching Apple Music's basic subscription rates. But Amazon added a twist by discounting the service for Amazon Prime members and slashing it it less than half the regular $9.99 monthly fee for owners of its Amazon Echo smart speaker.\n\nWill Apple Music Ever Catch Spotify? (And Does It Need to?)\n\nThe success of Apple Music isn't just about bragging rights.\n\nThe streaming music service is part of Apple's Services division. That division is increasingly important to the bottom line. It provides recurring revenue, which helps to protect against shocks when hardware sales hit rough patches. In AAPL's most recent quarter, Services posted the strongest year-over-year growth of any of Apple's divisions .\n\n2016 revenue numbers for Spotify aren't yet available, but the music streaming service has consistently lost money, including $176.9 million in 2014 and $188.7 million. The situation looked grim a year ago , with Apple Music growing rapidly. However, big increases in paid subscriber drove a revenue gain of 80% to $2.12 billion . That marked a turning point in the outlook for Spotify's survival.\n\nWith profitability a distinct possibility in 2017, Spotify could be in acquisition territory. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) have both been floated as potential buyers . An initial public offering could also be in its future.\n\nRegardless, Apple Music seems unlikely to knock Spotify off the top of the streaming music charts, at least not in the near future.\n\nThat doesn't mean Apple Music isn't a success. It quickly vaulted from zero to a contender for top spot in mere months and has continued to grow. As shown by the number of streaming music services that continue to attract paid subscribers, there is still plenty of room for multiple big players to make money.\n\nApple Music will continue to drive revenue into AAPL's Services division, even if that coveted No. 1 spot remains elusive.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Apple Inc. (AAPL) Apple Music Just Can't Catch Spotify appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) knows what it's doing. The company is a market leader in many fields, and would often rather abandon a product category rather than struggle on as a minor competitor to bigger and better rivals.\n\nBut even mighty Apple does the occasional swing-and-a-miss routine. And some of Cupertino's whiffs come in vibrant billion-dollar markets.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nApple ranks dead last in the $24 billion file-hosting market\n\nBrand Keys is a branding consultancy firm with more than three decades of expertise-building history under its belt. The firm is best known for its Customer Loyalty Engagement Index (CLEI) rankings, where a proprietary data-collection process builds customer-loyalty ratings in more than 80 specific product categories.\n\nApple, of course, dominates several of the latest Brand Keys ratings . The iPhone shows up all comers in the smartphone category, no tablet can beat the iPad's consumer loyalty, and MacBooks walks away with the top rating among laptop brands. In something of an upset, Apple Music even takes home the online music segment.\n\nAnd then there's the file-storage category. There, Apple doesn't just miss the top spot, but falls all the way to the bottom of 13 ranked services.\n\nHow bad is that result for Apple?\n\nTo be clear, Brand Keys claims that its measurements translate directly into future sales prospects and revenues. According to independent metrics from Markets and Markets , cloud storage is a $24 billion market today -- and expected to reach annual sales of $75 billion in just five years.\n\nIn other words, it looks like Apple is leaving a lot of cash on the table. The iCloud file-storage service is not pulling its weight, or moving the needle for Apple. Instead, consumers with a need for off-site file-storage tools prefer free services like Brand Keys' category winner, Sabrecat -- or a plethora of better-known options such as runner-up Dropbox, or third-place finisher Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Drive.\n\nApple is not only missing a significant market opportunity, but leaving a lot of that cash for Google parent Alphabet to grab instead.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook. Image source: Apple.\n\nWhy is Apple missing the boat?\n\nApple's iCloud is, in many ways, very similar to Google Drive and Dropbox. All three services allow users to store nearly any type of file in a centrally managed cloud server, accessible from any networked computer. They all come with small storage limits for a free account, all offer a terabyte of storage for $9.99 per month, and come with various tools for managing your stored files. But Apple does a few things differently.\n\nFirst and foremost, the easiest way to access iCloud content is via an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook. In fact, signing up for an iCloud account is part of the setup process for all of these systems. Then, the service is integrated into your Apple experience as the destination for system backup files, the default storage location for files created in the iWork office suite, and an option for storing user files in newer versions of the macOS system.\n\nAll of this is designed to keep users tightly bound to Apple's multi-device ecosystem. Once you're in, it's not easy to get untangled. Given Apple's massive market reach, especially in the tablet and smartphone segments, this alone should make iCloud a winner. Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the package as \"a strategy for the next decade\" in 2012.\n\nHowever, Apple never quite delivered on that grand ambition. iCloud is reportedly ostracized by other working groups within the company, starved of resources, and mostly seen as a necessary evil. Apple is a product company, and iCloud is not a marketable product on its own -- at least not in its current Apple-centric form. So, this odd piece of infrastructure machinery is left out in the cold.\n\nAnd there goes Apple's ticket to a $24 billion industry that's also on a rapid growth tear.\n\nGoogle sure is building its Drive product into everything from Gmail to mobile photo storage to storage space for corporate accounts. Dropbox is doing the same, while on the lookout for another buyout bid. And this market should only grow faster as the Internet of Things grows up, requiring acres of cloud-based storage space. These companies treat online file storage as an important business, valuable on its own merits.\n\nApple doesn't. Hence, the company is holding back on promoting iCloud, developing it further, or building it into other products, when appropriate.

While March is unlikely to hold any major events for Facebook stock, shares of the advertising firm are worth holding onto as the company still has quite a bit of growth ahead of it.\n\nSource: Via Stock Snap\n\nSince the firm's IPO in 2012, FB stock has appreciated considerably and the company itself has grown exponentially.\n\nInvestors who were able to ride out the Facebook stock's initial bumpy ride saw their shares gain steadily from 2013 on. With FB stock currently trading at $136.7 per share, many are wondering if the company will be able to keep growing and delivering such impressive returns.\n\nAfter all, the firm makes the majority of its money from advertising and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has admitted that the firm has reached its saturation point in terms of ad volume.\n\nThe Foundation of FB Stock's Long-Term Potential\n\nSo that leaves gaining new users as a way to bring in new revenue. However, Facebook's most recent earnings report showed that daily active users jumped up from 1 billion to 1.23 billion over the past year. How many more users can FB accumulate?\n\nThe answer is that Facebook could essentially double that figure - especially considering that the site is the most popular social media service around the globe. If you consider the fact that around half of the world's population has access to the internet, that means FB's target market is around 3.5 billion people. There are still many people who can be roped into the Facebook ecosystem, meaning there are still potential growth avenues for FB stock in the future.\n\nGrowing just by sheer numbers isn't the only way for Facebook stock to beef up its bottom line. The company can draw in more advertising dollars as it improves its offerings and increases engagement among the users that it has already obtained. On the bright side, FB has plenty of interesting features in the pipeline for both Instagram and its primary platform that will do just that.\n\nFor example, video is one of the areas that offers a lot of potential for Facebook. The firm recently hired Mina Lefevre, who used to lead scripted development at Viacom, Inc. (NASDAQ: VIA , NASDAQ: VIAB ), which is expected to help the company move forward in this space.\n\nFB is likely to develop its video platform significantly in the year to come. Many believe that the company is looking to expand its video offerings to compete with Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) YouTube; and judging by YouTube's advertising success, that would be a boon for Facebook stock.\n\nBeyond video, Facebook has another avenue by which to grow its advertising revenue: messaging. Between WhatsApp and its own Messenger, FB currently owns the two most popular messaging services in the world. What's more, Facebook has done very little so far to monetize those services. This year, we will likely see the company's plans for its messaging services take shape, which will likely provide a catalyst for FB stock.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Facebook Stock\n\nFacebook stock is certainly not cheap, but the company hasn't reached its plateau just yet. The company has conquered social media and it has proven that it has staying power, but the question now is whether the firm can continue to grow its ad revenue now that the social media site has reached its limit as far as ad volume.\n\nWhile there are still some questions as to how FB stock will move forward, the firm has a solid plan for the future and enough growth potential to justify a long position.\n\nAs of this writing, Laura Hoy was long FB.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Won't Stop Rolling Anytime Soon appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "After loading up on Apple ( AAPL ) shares, could Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) buy Alphabet Inc. ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) shares next? Alphabet has been bought aggressively by multiple famous gurus. Buffett and Munger have commented favorably on the company's competitive position several times. The latest Berkshire shareholder letter indicates Buffett is very knowledgeable about the technology space.\n\nThe fact that so many value investors are buying Alphabet at current multiples indicate it is a great business at a fair price. It is not immediately obvious how popular the stock is because Alphabet trades an A and a C share class, which are treated as seperate companies by lists put together through automation. They are economically equivalent, however, and if you add them up, Alphabet is one of the highest-owned stocks among the great investors tracked by GuruFocus.\n\nBack in 2009, Warren Buffett ( Trades , Portfolio ) talked about IBM ( IBM ), Apple and Google:\n\n\"The chances of being way wrong in IBM are probably less, at least for us, than the chances of being way wrong in Google or Apple. I just don't know how to value them. I would not be at all surprised to see them be worth a lot more money 10 years from now but I would not buy either one of them. I sure as hell wouldn't short them either.\"\n\nIn addition, Charlie Munger (Trades, Portfolio) said:\n\n\"Google has a huge new moat. In fact, I've probably never seen such a wide moat.\"\n\nMunger added it was also filled with sharks. It is impossible to assess a moat without understanding competitors and their chances to successfully assault a company's market share. In this case, Munger might have seen the potential early while Buffett remained unconvinced. Buffett has alluded to his biggest mistakes as acts of omission.\n\nBill Gates, former Microsoft ( MSFT ) chairman and a good friend of Buffett, stepped down in 2014. Microsoft runs the only real competition to Google search. Gates stepping down may have freed Buffett to learn about that competitive landscape from him.\n\nIn additon, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Chairman Eric Schmidt traveled to Omaha to talk to Buffett when setting up the new Alphabet structure, which is molded after Berkshire.\n\nShortly before the trip, they brought in CFO Ruth Porat, who understands the tech founders' goals for the company.\n\nBuffett included the following paragraphs in the 2017 shareholder letter, putting my spider senses on red alert:\n\n\"In 2002, entrepreneur Mitch Kapor asserted that 'By 2029 no computer - or 'machine intelligence' - will have passed the Turing Test,' which deals with whether a computer can successfully impersonate a human being. Inventor Ray Kurzweil took the opposing view. Each backed up his opinion with $10,000. I don't know who will win this bet, but I will confidently wager that no computer will ever replicate Charlie. That same year, Craig Mundie of Microsoft asserted that pilotless planes would routinely fly passengers by 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Google argued otherwise. The stakes were $1,000 each. To ease any heartburn Eric might be experiencing from his outsized exposure, I recently offered to take a piece of his action. He promptly laid off $500 with me. (I like his assumption that I'll be around in 2030 to contribute my payment, should we lose.)\"\n\nThis paragraph shows Buffett has been studying the tech world very hard and is open to the possibility the Turing test will be cracked by 2029. He also must have looked into the dynamics of driverless or pilotless technology, note the recent investment into airlines, to take on a $500 bet. I do not think betting against Buffett is generally a profitable endeavour. What jumped out at me is, apparently, Alphabet's chairman and Buffett recently spoke again. They must have spoken for quite some time for the subject of this casual bet to come up.\n\nAll these factors have led me to speculate on the potential of an Alphabet investment.\n\nThe pieces are falling into place.\n\nBuffett has been studying tech intensely.\n\nBerkshire has made a 180 as far as tech investments go.\n\nBuffett and Munger view Alphabet as having an incredibly strong moat.\n\nAlphabet's valuation is at an attractive level given the interest from the value investing greats. Porat is a great addition to the executive suite ,covering up pre-existing weaknesses in the team.\n\nGoogle executives have met with Buffett on multiple occasions and Schmidt talked to him recently.\n\nThe one thing I could see keeping Buffett from making an investment is his distaste for stock-based compensation. Alphabet continues to dole it out like it is candy on Halloween.\n\nI would go as far as to say it would greatly surprise me if we do not see Berkshire buying a stake in Alphabet in the next five years.\n\nDisclosure: Author owns none of these stocks.\n\nStart afree 7-day trial of Premium Membershipto GuruFocus.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus ." ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.427179402722881, 0.4993083900226758, 0.3995203659976387, 0.5303140830800405, 0.4413194444444444, 0.3744826327518635, 0.507020462803595, 0.3936161841630592, 0.5145665515918681, 0.5312900128040974 ], "headline" : [ "YouTube TV Is Here: What Investors Need to Know", "GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Gutted?

(NYSE: BRK.A , NYSE: BRK.B ) stock, Warren Buffett's gone and done just that. You'd have to be living under a rock somewhere not to be aware of the fact Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) became the world's most valuable company in early February; the first to surpass $700 billion in market cap enriching all those owning Apple stock.\n\nSource: Pete Souza via Wikimedia (Modified)\n\nOnly months ago, Apple was passed by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) as the world's most valuable company, but since then, AAPL stock has gone on a huge run, up 52% since May 12, 2016, the day the two companies switched roles.\n\nBy comparison, GOOGL stock is up 16% in the same period. A respectable performance - 200 basis points better than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA: SPY ) - but not enough to keep it in the top spot.\n\nWhy AAPL Stock Gives Berkshire Hathaway a Big Boost\n\nApparently, Warren Buffett and/or his two money managers - Todd Combs and Ted Weschler - were buying heavily in the fourth quarter of the year. At the end of Q3 2016, BRK.B held 15.2 million shares of Apple stock; by the end of the year that ballooned 268.2% to 57.4 million shares, a stake currently worth $7.8 billion through Feb. 23.\n\nAs a result of this buying binge, Berkshire Hathaway is one of AAPL's 10 largest shareholders owning 1.1% of Apple stock. Of greater importance to BRK.B stock owners is the fact AAPL stock is now its sixth largest equity position representing 5% of the entire portfolio and not too far off Berkshire's investment in International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ), which accounts for 9% of the equity portfolio.\n\nIt's amazing to think that Buffett didn't own any tech stocks in 2011 when he started buying IBM and now these two businesses represent one-seventh of Berkshire Hathaway's $148 billion equity portfolio.\n\nSo, if diversification is your thing, Buffett's move into Apple stock is just another reason why you might want to own BRK.B stock.\n\nSure, the company is firing on all cylinders, not to mention AAPL stock is still relatively cheap at 16 times earnings or about 25% lower than the S&P 500 , but those iPhone sales have a way of going sideways at a moments notice.\n\nRemember the first half of 2016?\n\nIt wasn't all peaches and cream as investors fretted about Apple's continuing sales slowdown. Ebbs and flows are common in the tech business. Holding AAPL stock within the Berkshire Hathaway fortress allows you to benefit from Apple's good times without suffering as much when it gets its next tech flu - and it will.\n\nA recent Marketwatcharticle discussed possible acquisition candidates for Apple's $200 billion in cash should Trump lower the tax it would pay to repatriate the money sitting in foreign bank accounts.\n\nWhile those inside AAPL, including its head of content, Eddy Cue, can't envision a large acquisition that would make sense for the company, one potential media company does come to mind - Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: SIRI ).\n\nWhy SIRI?\n\nIt's a business that's predictable, generates annual free cash flow of more than $1.5 billion and continues to grow the top- and bottom-line.\n\nBottom Line on BRK.B Stock\n\nMore importantly, Buffett bought 166 million shares of its stock in the fourth quarter to go along with shares already held in Liberty Media's SiriusXM tracking stock. Combining Apple Music with SiriusXM satellite radio wouldn't be the worse move in the world.\n\nHeck, by owning Berkshire Hathaway you get a small piece of a lot of pies including Apple.\n\nI'm not the first person to say this about BRK.B stock, but it really is the ultimate mutual fund/exchange-traded fund/hedge fund/private equity fund all wrapped up into one nice, shiny package.\n\nAs of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B) Stock Is Even Stronger Than Before appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has taken on some unexpected targets lately. None more ambitious - and unforeseen - than sticking its Alexa personal assistant in the Amazon Echo smart speaker.\n\nSource: Amazon\n\nThat move has paid off with a big lead in the race to become the hub of the smart home, despite AMZN's complete lack of smartphone presence.\n\nPer a report in The Information , Amazon is readying another bold move. If sources are correct, AMZN is preparing to take on Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Microsoft Office and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google G Suite with its own cloud-based productivity suite.\n\nReport: Amazon.com Is Working on a Productivity Suite\n\nThe Information broke the news that Amazon.com is working on its own productivity suite to take on Microsoft and Google. The website says AMZN's Amazon Web Services - AWS - unit has told some of its \"large corporate customers\" of its plans to offer a new suite of productivity apps that will compete against the two dominant players.\n\nMicrosoft Office has always been considered a cash cow for the company. The productivity suite quickly became the industry standard, the applications of choice for enterprise, schools and home PC users. To make its software seem more affordable, to break free of the boom bust cycle between major versions of Microsoft Office, and to address the growing threat of Google's free Google Apps suite, five years ago, the company began pushing Office 365.\n\nThis subscription version of Microsoft Office brought recurring monthly revenue and other advantages. Microsoft expanded into Office apps for mobile devices like Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPad and began to sell online storage for Office 365 users, with OneDrive.\n\nGoogle Apps/G Suite\n\nGoogle wasn't sitting still, though, refining Google Apps into G Suite , a full-on competitor to Office 365, with paid monthly subscription plans and online storage options. The company has also leveraged Google Apps and its lightweight Chrome OS into Chromebooks - ultra-low-cost laptops that have been giving Microsoft fits, especially in the education market.\n\nThat education market is where the potential for disruption is really playing out. With its free Google Apps and low-cost Chromebooks, Google upended the education market. By the end of 2015, more than half of all device in U.S. classrooms were Chromebooks . This has repercussions beyond the classroom, as those students turn into young professionals who are more comfortable with Google's productivity software than with Microsoft Office.\n\nI've seen the effect first hand. My kids do everything at school using G Suite, despite Microsoft offering free Office 365 subscriptions to students and computer labs full of Windows PCs. They ignore Microsoft Office and Apple's Pages/Numbers on our home computers, and instead log onto G Suite for doing homework.\n\nIf Google could quickly make waves in one of Microsoft's key strongholds, why couldn't Amazon.com march in and disrupt both companies?\n\nWhy Amazon Would Take On Microsoft Office\n\nThis is a key question. Taking on the Google and Apple in the smart home with the Amazon Echo made sense because the smart speaker was a Trojan horse. It offers a growing number of \"Skills\" that let it control other smart devices by voice command, or interact with online services.\n\nThat ropes consumers into buying it. But Alexa is a voice-activated path to effortlessly order products directly from Amazon.com, and gives an incentive to buy other Amazon products and services like Amazon Music Unlimited and Amazon Fire TV.\n\nWhere's the win for AMZN in offering productivity software, other than to tweak Microsoft and Google?\n\nFor the answer, look to AWS. Amazon Web Services dominates the market for cloud infrastructure and the profit from this division is a big driver of Amazon's overall growth. Amazon already has the servers in place and it has several of the components needed for a productivity suite, including its WorkDocs and WorkMail apps and the recently announced Amazon Chime video conferencing software. Stitch these together with a few additional components and Amazon could have its Microsoft Office and Google G Suite competitor.\n\nGoogle charges $5 to $10 per month for G Suite, while Microsoft Office 365 has several tiered options starting at $5.99 per month.\n\nAMZN could charge a competitive rate for its new offering, adding more subscription-based revenue to its bottom line while taking advantage of its existing cloud muscle. The base monthly fee could be supplemented by charging for additional online storage for enterprise customers - something it has plenty of.\n\nProductivity software could also become another free perk of Prime membership. Prime members that start using Amazon's productivity software could put pressure on their employers to invest in a subscription, in an effect like Google's approach that sees students graduate and look to their employers to provide G Suite access.\n\nAMZN isn't commenting and The Information's sources say all of this is still in the early stages, but the move makes sense. Amazon has been aggressively expanding beyond its role as an online retailer, AWS has the infrastructure needed to support the initiative, the company has been creeping into enterprise software with apps like WorkMail, and Google proved that the Microsoft Office behemoth isn't invulnerable. A productivity software suite from Amazon.com could well be the company's next big thing.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post The Next Big Thing for Amazon.com, Inc.

Everyone who's anyone is there -unless your company name is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ).\n\nSource: BlackBerry\n\nMWC 2017 officially started today, but the big announcements took place over the weekend.\n\nAnd in many ways, they set the stage for the coming battle for best smartphone that will pit Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone 8 and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) comeback Galaxy S8 against everyone else.\n\nHere's what you need to know about MWC 2017 .\n\nCutting Edge New Smartphones\n\nMobile World Congress is the venue where many manufacturers choose to launch their new smartphones. That means the trends are set for what to expect in the coming year. At MWC 2017, there have been a few standouts that lead to some interesting conclusions.\n\nLG's new G6 smartphone is one of the most talked about releases. The company abandoned the modular design it introduced in last year's G5. The new G6 incorporates design elements expected in the iPhone 8, with a glass front and back held together with a stainless-steel band.\n\nWhile bezels are still there, they're been minimized by moving the power button and fingerprint sensor to the back. The result is a 5.7-inch display in a compact body - and the display is wowing with its 564 ppi pixel density and support for HDR. The LG G6 also has a dual lens 13 megapixel camera, but unlike the iPhone 7 Plus, the extra lens is wide angle rather than telephone.\n\nAnother interesting flagship release is the P10 from China's Huawei . This new premium smartphone includes Leica -branded cameras and a Portrait Mode to compete with iPhone 7 Plus feature. In addition, the P10 uses Huawei's own processor, the Kirin 960. This is bad news for Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ), which is seeing more smartphone makers follow the lead of Apple by ditching the Snapdragon to develop their own customized chips.\n\nWhen the iPhone 8 arrives in the fall, its expected all-glass design isn't going to be as unique as Apple might have hoped. Cameras are going to be a big battleground, too, putting pressure on Apple to go further than it did with the dual-lens iPhone 7 Plus.\n\nNo Galaxy S8 at MWC 2017\n\nSamsung traditionally unveils its new Galaxy S smartphones at Mobile World Congress. Not this year. Delayed by the Galaxy Note 7 battery investigation, Samsung is expected to unveil the Galaxy S8 at an event on March 29.\n\nThe company did take the wraps off two new tablets , though. The Galaxy Tab S3 and Galaxy Book. The latter is offered in two different sizes, runs Windows 10, comes with a snap-on keyboard case and stylus and is aimed at Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface Pro.\n\nGoogle Assistant Coming to Android Nougat and Marshmallow Devices\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has had a big decision to make since introducing Google Assistant. The company broke with tradition to make its new AI-powered digital assistant exclusive to its own Google Pixel smartphones. But that restriction means the number of phones running Google Assistant are outnumbered by Siri-powered Apple devices and Amazon.com,Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Alexa-powered smart speakers.\n\nGoogle chose MWC 2017 to announce it's decided to go back to the strategy of volume over exclusivity. Google Assistant will start rolling out to devices running Android Nougat and Marshmallow starting this week.\n\nBlackBerry and Nokia Makes a Splash at MWC 2017\n\nIf you'd asked anyone a few months ago what companies would be generating buzz at MWC 2017, it's doubtful that BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ: BBRY ) or Nokia Corp (ADR) (NYSE: NOK ) would be anywhere on that list. But they both pulled it off. Sort of.\n\nBlackBerry's last hurrah in smartphones is the new BlackBerry KeyOne . The last phone with the company's name on it that was designed in-house combines Android with a classic BlackBerry keyboard. There's grumbling about the $549 price, but a general feeling that had BBRY released this phone a few years ago, it might still be relevant in the smartphone space.\n\nThe other big surprise was the return of the Nokia brand. Finland's HMD Global bought the rights to use the Nokia name on phones, and at MWC 2017 it announced three new Nokia Android smartphones aimed at the Chinese market.\n\nThe company is also bringing back the classic Nokia 3310 cell phone. Considered to be virtually indestructible, the Nokia 3310 was first released in 2000 and sold over 126 million units . The new version is a little less sturdy, but has new colors, and updated display and runs just over $50.\n\nNokia gets some licensing revenue out of this, but was not involved in the development of the new phones bearing its brand.\n\nEveryone Against the iPhone 8\n\nThe announcements from MWC 2017 largely set the stage for the coming battle for smartphone supremacy. Samsung still must take the wraps off the Galaxy S8, but after that happens, we'll largely know what Apple's iPhone 8 will be up against.\n\nIt looks like Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone will face a strong field with large displays, impressive cameras, Google Assistant on board and new designs - at least some of which follow the direction Apple is expected to take.\n\nWho will have the best smartphone of 2017? With the big Mobile World Congress reveals over with, the ball is now in Samsung and Apple's court.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Mobile World Congress: Apple Inc. (AAPL) vs. Everyone Else appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStartups may be a source of tremendous innovation. But of course, old-line companies can too. Just look at Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ). Launched in 1993, the company's co-founders - which included tech veterans like Jen-Hsun Huang (now the CEO), Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem - saw a great opportunity to develop graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming market.\n\nSource: via Nvidia\n\nWhile growth was strong, there was always skepticism. Was the market big enough?\n\nWell, of course, we know that GPUs have proven to be quite versatile, having applications in diverse areas like AI (artificial intelligence), self-driving cars, VR (virtual reality) and the Internet of Things (IoT). The main reason is that this core technology can process huge amounts of data on a cost-effective basis.\n\nAnd yes, Wall Street has certainly caught on to this. During the past year, NVDA stock is up a sizzling 200%-plus.\n\nBut what now? Is it still a good time to buy NVDA stock? Or should investors wait for a better valuation?\n\nBreaking Down NVDA Stock\n\nFirst of all, there are signs that the momentum is losing some of its steam. For the year so far, the stock is down 5% after back-to-back downgrades in the past week. This is despite the fact that the overall markets have been extremely bullish, with the Nasdaq up about 8.5%.\n\nIn fact, since reaching an all-time high in early February, Nvidia stock has since fallen by 14%.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing has been the muted response from wall Street from the company's most recent earnings report . Revenues soared 55% to $2.17 billion and adjusted earnings came to $1.13 per share, up from 94 cents for the same period a year ago. Wall Street, on the other hand, was looking for $2.11 billion in revenues and earnings of 83 cents.\n\nFor the most part, there was really nothing to complain about. It was, well, nearly a perfect performance.\n\nYet NVDA stock fell by about 2.4% on the news.\n\nThen again, it seems that the good news is already baked into the valuation - and then some. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio on NVDA stock is at 30X. By comparison, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) trades at 20X and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) sports a multiple of 22X. No doubt, the NVDA stock valuation makes other traditional chip operators look almost embarrassing. Keep in mind that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) both trade at about 12X.\n\nInterestingly enough, Wall Street analysts are getting a little antsy about the valuation for NVDA stock as well. Note that the average price target is at $113.59. This implies only a 7% gain from current levels.\n\nFor example, Roth Capital Partners analyst Brian Alger downgraded his rating on NVDA stock from \"buy\" to \"neutral\" recently. Yes, his biggest concern is the valuation.\n\nBesides, the year-over-year comparisons on revenues and earnings will not get any easier for the company. If there is even a slight miss or sign of deceleration, it seems reasonable that there could be a sell-off. Might as well take profits after NVDA stock has provided substantial gains, right?\n\nCertainly.\n\nAnother potential issue is the competition. Let's face it, rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) has been making nice strides with its own graphics systems. As seen with the latest earnings report, the company looks poised for a growth spurt - and this may come at the expense of NVDA. Of course, investors have been buying up AMD stock, which is up around 600% during the past year.\n\nNow, this is in no way to diminish NVDIA's outstanding technology and the potential growth opportunities. Hey, just with autos, the addressable market could be at least $10 trillion (this is based on recent NVDA investor presentation ).\n\nBut for now, there probably should be caution. For the most part, NVDA stock is probably due for a cooling-off period. Yet this should be good news, since it may mean that investors who missed the first big move could get a second chance on the stock.\n\nTom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbook and also has his own free iOS app to estimate your tax refund, which is at PathwayTax.com .

It's never clear beforehand which direction these indexes, or the stocks that comprise them, will move; the reasons for their price swings only make sense in retrospect.\n\nBut that truth doesn't stop people from making aggressive predictions attempting to identify the Next Big Thing or to call a coming crash or boom. Here are a few classic examples of some smart market watchers getting burned by their stock calls.\n\n1. McDonald's will trounce Google as an investment\n\nWhitney Tilson has used his value investing approach to produce awesome returns for himself and his investors over the years. Yet his tendency to bash \"expensive\" companies with high price-to-earnings ratios has also burned the hedge fund giant -- big time.\n\nFor example, back in 2004, Tilson made a bold prediction . Writing for The Motley Fool at the time, he said the soon-to-be-public Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) (a.k.a. Google) would almost certainly flame out as a business. \"I'd wager that odds are at least 90% that its profit margins and growth rate will be materially lower five years from now,\" he argued.\n\nTilson got even more specific, saying that McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) would make a much better bet given its far lower valuation. \"I believe that it is virtually certain that Google's stock will be highly disappointing to investors foolish enough to participate in its overhyped offering -- you can hold me to that,\" he concluded.\n\nGOOGL Market Cap data by YCharts .\n\nSo how did that prediction pan out? Since 2005, Alphabet shares are up roughly 16 times, compared to less than a 400% return for the fast food titan. The search engine giant produced nearly $20 billion of net income last year, versus McDonald's $4.5 billion. Today, Alphabet is worth almost six times McDonald's in the eyes of the market.\n\n2. Smartphones will be a bust\n\nA deep understanding of technology isn't enough to protect you from being surprised by major shifts in the industry. Andrew Grove was one of the founders of Intel , which profoundly shaped the semiconductor industry. He was Time Magazine 's Man of The Year in 1997. Yet in 1992 he made a prediction that looks amazingly shortsighted in retrospect.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nA New York Times article described Grove as standing diametrically opposed to the position taken by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) that smartphones, then imagined as \"personal communicators,\" might develop into a huge business. They'd be \"the mother of all markets,\" according to Apple's then-CEO, John Sculley.\n\nGrove disagreed. The idea of a communicating device that people carried around with them is \"a pipe dream driven by greed,\" he said. Ironically, the article lists a few predictions about the technology that proved prescient. These personal communicators might handle emails, use GPS to map directions, and even allow someone to \"order pizza using a combination of custom electronic forms and wireless fax.\"\n\nToday, the smartphone industry is massive, with Apple accounting for nearly 150 million iPhone sales in the past year. These devices helped spur over $24 billion of complementary service-based revenue, which demonstrates that, if anything, investors weren't being greedy enough about the potential for smartphones to find a huge market.\n\n3. The Dow is headed to 36,000\n\nJames Glassman's 1999 book titled Dow 36,000 hasn't aged well. In fact, Washington Post economics columnist Neil Irwin called it \"perhaps the most spectacularly wrong investing book ever\" given that it forecast a massive rally for stocks between 1999 and 2004.\n\nGlassman's timing couldn't have been worse. The Dow hit 14,000 the year his book published before plummeting to a 15-year low of 7,000 in 2009. A roaring rally has pushed the blue-chip index back to new highs recently, but today it's still 42% below the mark he believed the Dow would achieve over a decade ago.\n\n^DJI data by YCharts .\n\nTo his credit, Glassman has taken a hard look at how his prediction could have been so far off the mark. He identified two major factors that he and his co-author missed : earnings growth and the attitude of investors as reflected in the price-to-earnings multiples they are willing to pay for stocks. Neither trend went in the direction they had targeted.\n\nA better way\n\nThese failed forecasts illustrate how overconfidence can prove fatal to your portfolio while predictions about economic trends are rarely more than a distraction from the business of accumulating stock market returns.\n\nBold predictions are compelling because they attract debate and can pay big dividends if proven correct. But no one knows which direction stocks or markets will move over the short term. That's why investors are better off simply buying a diverse group of solid stocks and holding on to the shares for years (or decades) while allowing the power of compound returns to do all of the hard work.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Apple\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, the action camera maker only spent $35.6 million on buybacks before the plan expired last September.\n\nThose purchases were poorly timed, since GoPro bought back about 1.5 million shares at an average price of $23.05 per share -- roughly 140% higher than its price today. GoPro made all those purchases during the fourth quarter of 2015, and didn't buy back any more stock until the plan expired.\n\nImage source: GoPro.\n\nBy doing so, GoPro has seemingly acknowledged that initiating a buyback plan was a really bad move, and the company doesn't seem interested in buying back any more stock for the foreseeable future. Should investors be happy or upset about this strategic shift?\n\nWhy investors should be happy\n\nGoPro's prior buyback plan burned cash that should have been applied to R&D or acquisitions of smaller companies, since the company is gradually falling behind the tech curve.\n\nThe Hero 5 isn't much more powerful than the Hero 4, the Karma drone's recall practically handed the market to DJI , and GoPro still hasn't launched a stand-alone 360-degree camera to counter Samsung 's(NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Gear 360, Ricoh 's Theta, and other similar cameras. GoPro's software ecosystem also remains small, despite the introduction of new editing apps and a cloud backup service . Investing heavily in those areas would make more sense than buying back stock.\n\nSamsung's Gear 360. Image source: Samsung.\n\nEven if GoPro wanted to repurchase stock, it can no longer do so from its free cash flow. The company generated a negative free cash flow of $151 million over the past 12 months, due to four straight quarters of losses that only recently ended with a return to profitability last quarter.\n\nThe lack of a new buyback plan also indicates that CFO Brian McGee, who replaced Jack Lazar last March, doesn't plan to follow in his predecessor's footsteps. When Lazar unveiled the previous buyback in 2015, some analysts saw the plan as a thinly veiled attempt to offset GoPro's liberal use of stock-based compensation -- which inflated its share count and diluted existing shares. That move arguably benefited insiders much more than investors.\n\nWhy investors should be upset\n\nHowever, launching a new buyback plan this year would give investors a sign that the stock's downside potential is limited. GoPro stock also isn't expensive, with an EV/Sales ratio of 0.96 and a 5-year PEG ratio of 0.7. Since a PEG ratio under 1 is considered cheap, GoPro is undervalued relative to its earnings growth potential -- if it can match analysts' long-term expectations.\n\nMany of GoPro's investors would likely welcome a buyback, since the stock's only near-term catalyst is the relaunch of the Karma, which could struggle to reach customers after missing the crucial holiday season.\n\nA big buyback could also flush out short sellers -- who were shorting 33% of the company's outstanding shares as of Feb. 9 -- and spark a short squeeze. That rally could inspire GoPro's insiders, who sold more shares than they bought over the past 12 months, to finally buy more shares. That, in turn, could inspire institutional investors, who only hold about 38% of GoPro shares, to finally come back.\n\nForget about buybacks... for now\n\nGoPro's abandonment of buybacks can be considered positive or negative, but I believe that the company should focus more on improving its core technologies.\n\nThe company has repeatedly claimed that it has a bright future in virtual reality, but its multi-camera Omni and Odyssey rigs were too bulky and pricey compared to cheaper action-camera sized solutions like the Gear 360. GoPro secured an early 360-degree video partnership with Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube, but YouTube subsequently opened up that platform to a wide range of other cheaper cameras.\n\nGoPro's cloud backup platform also doesn't make sense, since it charges a $5 monthly fee for a service which Google Photos provides for free on smartphones. Moreover, the platform doesn't backup videos in 4K quality -- which likely disappoints hardcore GoPro users. Lastly, GoPro must execute a smart marketing blitz to get the Karma back on track, especially after DJI's Mavic Pro delivered many similar features in a superior package last year.\n\nThe key takeaway\n\nBuybacks are often considered a strategy that mature companies use after they run out of ways to significantly improve their core businesses. GoPro is in a slump, but it hasn't reached maturity yet since it still has plenty of ways to improve its camera, drone, and software businesses. Therefore, I believe that investors should be happy that GoPro didn't initiate a new buyback plan this year.\n\n10 stocks we like better than GoPro\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

DigitalGlobe, if you recall, is the American satellite-imaging company that itself bought one-time Motley Fool recommendation GeoEye a few years ago.\n\nJust before announcing its own sale, DigitalGlobe reported a loss for its fiscal fourth quarter. And if you ask me, this suggests the time is ripe for DigitalGlobe to cash out -- the more so because its primary area of business is about to get even tougher to compete in.\n\nHow hi-res is a high-resolution snapshot from space? Here's one that Planet Labs' now-acquired Terra Bella satellites recently snapped of the U.S. Air Force's Davis-Monthan airplane \"boneyard\" of decommissioned military aircraft. Image source: Terra Bella.\n\nWho is DigitalGlobe?\n\nDigitalGlobe is one of the biggest names in satellite-based, highly detailed Earth imaging. The company operates a constellation of five satellites capable of snapping photographs from orbit at resolutions as minute as 30 centimeters per pixel. DigitalGlobe calls its constellation \"the best in the world\" and \"the largest constellation in the industry,\" and that's at least half right.\n\nProblem is, it's also half wrong. DigitalGlobe may dominate the market for highly detailed Earth imaging. But over at upstart Planet Labs (also known simply as \"Planet\"), one of the leaders of the \"new space\" industry is rapidly overtaking DigitalGlobe in breadth of coverage.\n\n(Re-)Introducing Planet Labs\n\nAs we discussed last month, Planet had for some time been discussing acquiring Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) satellite imaging business, Terra Bella . The purchase price remains a mystery -- but the deal itself is apparently now a \"go.\" On Feb. 3, Planet confirmed that it will indeed acquire Terra Bella from Alphabet, along with its fleet of seven high-resolution (capable of sub-meter resolutions) satellites.\n\nThen, last week, Planet announced the launch of 88 new \"Dove\" medium-resolution (three to five meters per pixel) satellites, more than doubling the size of its medium-res constellation to 144 birds in orbit.\n\nPlanet made history here in a couple of ways. First, its deployment was part of an Indian government PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) launch that sent 16 other satellites, in addition to Planet's, into space. At 104 satellites total, the mission that carried Planet's Doves was the largest-ever satellite deployment made from a single rocket.\n\nMore important, Planet says that its 144 Doves in orbit, plus five RapidEye satellites acquired from BlackBridge in 2015, give it a constellation of 149 satellites in orbit today. Feel free to mentally add seven more to that number once the Terra Bella acquisition is finalized, if you like. But already, Planet's mixed bag of 149 satellites gives it \"the largest private satellite constellation in history.\"\n\nThis is significant not only because it gives Planet bragging rights. By more than doubling its satellite constellation, Planet says it now has the ability to \"image all of Earth's landmass every day.\" Alone among satellite operators, Planet can now take a snapshot of every square foot of Earth's solid surface once per day, every day of the year.\n\nWhat it means to investors\n\nWith every passing day, Planet Labs is getting bigger, treading more and more on DigitalGlobe's astro-turf, and making its rival's products nonunique. Indeed, even if the photos taken by Planet's Doves don't offer quite the same resolution as DigitalGlobe offers, Planet's ability to take so many snapshots every day gives the company a more all-encompassing view of what's happening around the globe.\n\nIt's difficult to guess what advances will flow from access to such data. Better weather forecasting, certainly. A clearer view of the progression of global warming, its effects and its causes, very likely. But we can also anticipate Planet generating better data on traffic patterns on highways, at ports, and along shipping routes; on the spread of residential development that could guide brick-and-mortar retailers on where to place their next big-box stores; and in countless other ways.\n\nThe future is looking awfully bright for Planet Labs. And it's getting brighter every day, one Dove at a time.\n\nLook! Up in the sky! This time it really is a bird -- in fact, a whole lot of Planet Labs' Flock 3p Doves.

Image source: IMAX.\n\nIMAX Corporation (NYSE: IMAX) is the acknowledged industry leader in the premium large theater format and has built its reputation on the continuous innovation of its digital movie camera and high-performance laser projection system. With that expertise, it should come as no surprise that, when Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google decided to enter the field of virtual reality, it partnered with IMAX to develop the best \"cinema-grade virtual reality (VR) camera.\" IMAX is providing a crew of engineers and technicians that will collaborate with Google to develop a high-resolution camera from scratch to address the unique challenges presented by virtual reality. It will leverage Google's Jump platform, which stitches together 360 degree video into a seamless panoramic view, providing an immersive experience.\n\nIMAX then announced a virtual reality location-based initiative, in a joint venture with the game developer Starbreeze AB. This agreement would integrate the company's StarVR headset, which provides an industry-leading 210-degree view, and its library of virtual reality games and entertainment with content produced on the IMAX Google VR camera. Going further, IMAX is looking to leverage its existing relationships with Hollywood studios and directors to create new movie-based content.\n\nGoogle's Jump 360 degree camera rig.

Image source: IMAX.\n\nIMAX envisions a communal virtual reality experience that friends would enjoy together, which would be available at multiplexes and shopping malls, as well as popular tourist destinations. Late last year, the company announced that it, and a number of its partners, had completed the first round of funding -- which amounted to $50 million -- to create 25 pieces of content over the next three years.\n\nThe next tech growth industry?\n\nThis technology may be in the early stages, but it is ramping up fast. A report by Goldman Sachs estimates that virtual reality -- and its kissing cousin augmented reality -- could become an $80 billion industry by 2025. Investing now in this revolutionary technology could pay significant dividends in years to come. IMAX feels it is a natural fit with its existing business. On its most recent conference call, IMAX said:\n\nThe core requirements of launching a location-based VR experience line up nicely with our company's core skill sets. We have studio and film maker relationships on the content side; capture mechanisms for new content; relationships with exhibitors and real estate developers for potential VR sites; and a brand that is synonymous with immersive experiences.\n\nIMAX has tied the disparate parts of the virtual reality experience together in a nice neat package. With its own cutting-edge filming and projecting technology, Google's Jump, Starbreeze headsets and games, and buy-in from Hollywood heavyweights brandishing premium content.

Image source: IMAX.\n\nTough comps\n\nIMAX reported revenue of $106.9 million for the quarter, down 10% from $119.3 million from the prior year quarter, though it was better than the $99.6 million analysts were expecting. Net income of $0.27 per diluted share also exceeded expectations of $0.21 expected by analysts. Pulling back to a wider view, the overall annual results looked better. For the full year, IMAX produced revenue of $377 million compared to $374 million in the prior year.\n\nLet's face it: While 2016 was a good year at the movies, this was never going to be easy. The slate from 2015 boasted such cinematic heavyweights as Jurassic World , Furious 7 , Avengers: Age of Ultron , Minions , and Star Wars: The Force Awakens . These top five movies pulled in a combined $7.8 billion in box office. Even though 2016 leaders Captain America: Civil War , Rogue One: A Star Wars Story , Finding Dory and Zootopia , and The Jungle Book were each an unqualified success, their combined box office of $5.2 billion was nearly $2.6 billion below the results of 2015's all-stars. That's a lot of popcorn.\n\nExpanding network and deals\n\nThere was, however, plenty of good news in the report for investors willing to dig a little deeper. The company installed 166 new IMAX theaters during the year, up 22% over the prior year. This brings the installed base of theaters to 1,215 screens in 75 countries. The company also signed installation agreements for a record 319 IMAX theater systems during the year and the backlog of theaters waiting to be built now totals 498. The majority of these new signings were joint-revenue sharing agreements, which cost more up front, but allows IMAX to share in future box office revenue going forward. This all indicates that the company is well positioned to take advantage of an improved slate of movies in 2017 and beyond.\n\nIMAX also announced that it had extended its existing agreement with The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) with a multi-picture deal through 2019. From the press release:\n\nHighlights of the agreement include IMAX's involvement in the release of Lucasfilm's untitled Indiana Jones film, untitled Han Solo Star Wars anthology film, Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Star Wars: Episode IX, Marvel's Black Panther , Ant-Man and the Wasp , Captain Marvel , Avengers: Infinity War and the untitled Avengers sequel; Disney's Beauty and the Beast , A Wrinkle in Time and Mulan ; Pixar's The Incredibles 2 and Toy Story 4 and Walt Disney Animation Studios' Wreck-It Ralph sequel.\n\nIMAX has new virtual opportunites! Image source: IMAX.\n\nJUMPing on this opportunities\n\nAnother exciting development for the company is in the field of virtual reality (VR). IMAX announced last year that it had partnered with Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Google to develop a cinema grade VR camera, incorporating Google's Jump 360 camera rig. This fits into IMAX's strategy for a location-based virtual reality initiative, which would allow friends to participate in a group VR experience. On the conference call, IMAX indicated that more than 7,000 attendees had visited the pilot center, which opened in Los Angeles on January 6th, during its first six weeks of operation. The company believes that providing consumers with an option to participate in VR without spending thousands of dollars on equipment will \"kick-start\" the industry. As the result of this successful pilot, IMAX is expanding its experiment to five additional locations, which it expects will all be open by mid-year.\n\nThough 2016 didn't give IMAX investors anything to cheer about, the company has been investing in the future. IMAX has been quietly investing in big initiatives, signing new theaters and building out its network. Seems like its following advice from an old movie \"if you build it, they will come\".\n\n10 stocks we like better than IMAX\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Baidu's total operating costs were up 6% to RMB 16 billion, with content acquisition costs (for iQiyi online video), traffic acquisition costs and bandwidth acquisition costs driving much of the growth. As a result, Baidu's operating profit (GAAP) for the quarter was down 38% y-o-y to RMB 2.2 billion. Moreover, the company's net income was significantly lower than the prior year period and earnings per ADS was 84% down to RMB 11.40 per ADS for the quarter.\n\nSmaller Segments Drive Revenue Growth, Compress Margins\n\nBaidu has witnessed strong growth in two of its smaller revenue streams over the the last 2-3 years - its online video streaming platform iQiyi, which is similar to Netflix ( NFLX ), and transaction services. Both segments witnessed over 70% revenue growth in 2015, which was slightly lower than the triple digit growth seen in the previous year. The company reported 23% growth in the gross merchandise value (GMV) for its transaction services segment to RMB 18.1 billion in the December quarter. Similarly, the total number of Baidu Wallet user accounts was up to 100 million users by the end of December, up from only about 53 million in the year-ago period. Furthermore, the total number of monthly active users (MAUs) for mobile maps rose to 341 million users, 23% higher than the previous year levels.\n\nSimilarly, Baidu's iQiyi online video streaming has also grown at a rapid pace over the last couple of years. However, the company has operated its streaming video business as well as the transaction business at a loss over the past few years. In December 2015, there were reports suggesting that the company could spin off the iQiyi division. Earlier last year, a consortium of investors led by Baidu CEO Robin Li wanted to buy out the iQiyi business for $2.3 billion, but later dropped the bid after investors claimed that the price was too low. More recently, Baidu announced that it has raised funding for the video streaming business, which should help it acquire more content and help the company focus on long-term growth.\n\nTo fuel growth in the smaller revenue streams, Baidu has invested heavily in content acquisition costs, bandwidth costs for the video business and traffic acquisition costs for the transaction business, in addition to high marketing expenses for both. This has led to operating losses for both divisions over the last few years - a trend which was also observed in the most recent quarter. Baidu reported that the operating profit margin (non-GAAP) for the transaction services business in Q4 was down around 22 percentage points on a y-o-y basis while the operating profit margin for iQiyi compressed by over 9 percentage points through the quarter. These divisions are likely to be operating at a loss over next couple of years as well. As a result, we forecast the operating profits for both these divisions to be be negative over the next few years.\n\nGrowth In The First Half Of The Year Drives Full Year Results\n\n\n\nOver the last two quarters, Baidu's revenue growth for its core search services segment has been hindered by a revision in regulatory policy that drove down marketing revenues through the quarter. According to the latest Chinese laws, online ads and marketingpractices for medical, pharmaceutical, and healthcare products and services on online platforms have to go through mandatory regulatory approvals.\n\nNet revenues for the full year were around 6% higher on a y-o-y basis to RMB 70.5 billion. Comparatively, higher operating expenses - primarily for content acquisition, bandwidth acquisition and marketing expenses led operating profit to fall by 14% to just over RMB 10 billion. As a result, the company-wide operating profit margin compressed by 360 basis points to 14%. The resulting earnings per ADS was down 67% to just under RMB 32 per ADS, as shown above.\n\nSee our complete analysis for Baidu\n\nView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):\n\nGlobal Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap\n\nMore Trefis Research" ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.5063418577307465, 0.457100223009314, 0.3866299270904532, 0.5260027244728737, 0.5176272821381513, 0.5047892139013633, 0.4814545454545454, 0.4919059011164273, 0.4240387748452263, 0.3286173767752714 ], "headline" : [ "Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

After all, the sector is just ripe with fast-moving, high revenue generating companies. Over time, investing in tech stocks has resulted in some pretty great gains for investors. After all, given the volatility associated with the technology sector, most investors these days choose to use tech exchange-traded funds to get their fix.\n\nSource: FamZoo Staff via Flickr (Modified)\n\nAnd when it comes to tech ETFs, investors normally choose the Technology SPDR (ETF) (NYSEARCA: XLK ). With more than $16.5 billion dollars in assets and large trading volumes, the XLK has become the top tech ETF.\n\nBut it's not the only one out there. There are more than 50 tech ETFs currently out there. Investors just using the XLK for ease of use may be missing the sector's best bets and biggest opportunities.\n\nWith that in mind, here are three ignored tech ETFs that are too good to pass up.\n\nBest Tech ETFs to Buy: First Trust DJ Internet Index Fund (ETF) (FDN)\n\nExpenses: 0.54%, or $54 per $10,000 invested\n\nWhile tech encompass a lot of areas, the internet is where most of the growth is coming from. From e-commerce to social media, the internet continues to change how we function in society.\n\nAnd that's why the First Trust DJ Internet Index Fund (ETF) (NYSEARCA: FDN ) should feature a prominent place in your portfolio.\n\nFDN tracks the Dow Jones Internet Composite Index, which is essentially a measure of all the large-cap internet-focused firms in the United States. You're getting search/advertising giants like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ), travel sites like Expedia Inc (NASDAQ: EXPE ) and even online brokers like TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: AMTD ). If it operates a website and derives the bulk of its revenues from that site, then FDN has it.\n\nThe real benefit of that focus has been FDN's returns.\n\nSince launching in 2008, FDN has had a staggering cumulative return of 344%. That works out to be around 14.08% annually. Moreover, that performance crushes the broader XLK, which only returned about 9% annually in that time.\n\nAdd in FDN's low expense ratio of 0.54%, and you have one of the best tech ETFs to buy.\n\nBest Tech ETFs to Buy: iShares Exponential Technologies ETF (XT)\n\nExpenses: 0.47%\n\nThe tech sector is always at the forefront of innovation. The problem is, when you're looking into the future, you're not exactly sure what's going to stick. For every cloud computing, there are VR headsets.\n\nTo play the upcoming decades right, you could cobble together a stock or two from each hottest trend and see if they make or it. Or you could just buy one of the tech ETFs that bet on \" exponential \" technology.\n\nAs the first and oldest fund in the sector, the iShares Exponential Technologies ETF (NYSEARCA: XT ) should be first on your list.\n\nThe $900 million ETF , invests in the newest of the new. That includes various technology sub-themes like cloud computing, robotics, bioinformatics, nanotechnology and more. In total, the ETF owns nearly 200 different cutting-edge tech firms. But here's the real beauty, XT isn't just focused on \"tech\" companies. Healthcare, industrial and even consumer discretionary stocks make their way into the ETF. This allows investors to participate across the board of firms offering high-tech solutions in their respective industries.\n\nIn the end, XT could be one of the best tech ETFs for long-term investors to own as these cutting-edge ideas take hold.\n\nBest Tech ETFs to Buy: Guggenheim China Technology ETF (CQQQ)\n\nExpenses: 0.70%\n\nWhat happens when you combine one of the fastest growing sectors in the market with one of the fastest growing nations? You get a recipe for long-term success.\n\nThe Guggenheim China Technology ETF (NYSEARCA: CQQQ ) seems like an odd choice in that it tracks 74 Chinese technology stocks. But believe me, this is one of the tech ETFs that should be on your list. China really is a tech powerhouse and it is as much about technology as the U.S.\n\nFor starters, the nation boasts one of the largest mobile phone and internet user bases in the world. This has helped it curate a rich ecosystem devoted to online gaming, shopping and entertainment. Ever hear the names Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA ) or Ctrip.Com International Ltd (ADR) (NASDAQ: CTRP )? Thought so.\n\nMeanwhile, many Chinese hardware brands are becoming staples across the world. Think Lenovo Group Limited (ADR) (OTCMKTS: LNVGY ) for computers or Huawei for smartphones and other gadgets. The nation is a dominant solar panel and semiconductor producer … the list goes on and on.\n\nAs a result, CQQQ could be a great long-term play as China emerges and becomes a 'superpower' - one that runs on a hefty dose of tech.\n\nAs of this writing, Aaron Levitt was long XT.\n\nThe post 3 Ignored Tech ETFs That Are Too Good to Pass Up appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Last week, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) spinoff Waymo sued Uber for stealing some of its key autonomous car technology. It doesn't take a lawyer to know that things don't look good for Uber, but does this spell disaster for the ride-sharing company's self-driving dream? Here's what you need to know.\n\nThe not-so-secret dirty details\n\nNow that this is in the rearview mirror, it's clear we should've seen it coming. According to Alphabet, former Waymo employee Anthony Levandowski illegally downloaded 14,000 \"highly confidential and proprietary files\" in December 2015 that detailed the secret software and hardware designs for Waymo's LIDAR system. LIDAR systems are being developed as the \"eyes\" of most companies' attempts at autonomous vehicles, allowing them to \"see\" the world around them via millions of low-power laser beams blasted out every second. In January 2016, Levandowski started his own self-driving company in and, two weeks later , resigned without notice from Waymo. In August 2016, he sold his company to Uber for $680 million.\n\nIMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET (WAYMO)\n\nLevandowski and Uber might've managed to keep things under the radar, were it not for a LIDAR component vendor (apparently inadvertently) copying Waymo on an email to Uber, in which attached documents bore a \"striking resemblance\" to Waymo's own LIDAR designs.\n\nAlphabet knows a thing or two about computers, and the details of Levandowski's data dig only served to make the alleged act of design theft look even more provable. So what does this mean for Alphabet, Uber, and the future of self-driving car stocks?\n\nBlinded by the smite?\n\nLawsuits are a norm, not an anomaly, among major corporations. Alphabet itself is under constant legal attack: At the moment, it's facing antitrust inquiries in the European Union, Argentina, India, Brazil, Russia, and South Korea, as well as patent violation and intellectual property claims by the likes of Oracle . As a privately held company, Uber doesn't announce its legal matters in a single spot, but a quick search turns up hundreds of suits.\n\nOn issues of intellectual property, in particular, lawsuits can get particularly sticky. If proven guilty, Uber will likely cough up buckets of cash to Alphabet since, in Alphabet's words, Uber has avoided \"incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology.\" By Alphabet's calculation, that includes the $680 million valuation of Otto and Uber's entire self-driving program, since they believe it would've otherwise stayed stalled.\n\nThat counterfactual claim is hard to prove, and it may also be difficult to disentangle Uber's own recent advances in self-driving technology. It's impossible for Uber staff to forget what they now know, and almost as impossible for them to even determine whether what they know is Alphabet's or Uber's.\n\nA signal for self-driving car stocks\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMore so than anything else, this lawsuit serves as a warning for self-driving car companies and their shareholders. Alphabet, Uber, and others are in a fierce competition to build the best self-driving car out there, and any attempt to cheat will be met with the full force of the law.\n\nBut investors shouldn't equate lawsuits with bankruptcy. Rather, they should take a \"buyer beware\" stance and ask whether a given lawsuit is a warning sign of a deeper issue. An intellectual property lawsuit could be an indicator of an overly competitive company culture, a short-term issue, or even a lack of creative talent. Which problem is at the root of the suit could be a better indicator about the ultimate direction of the corporate defendant's stock than the specific legal details. So if you're an investor in autonomous car companies, remember to look out for lawsuits, read into them the right things, and make informed choices as you hunt for the biggest potential winners in this increasingly competitive race.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares)\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Upcoming services from Hulu and YouTube will only further serve to intensify the competition.\n\nThough it's still early in the game, after looking at what YouTube TV has to offer, it's a good bet that Alphabet's (GOOG) YouTube is likely to come out in front.\n\nAt $35 a month for roughly 40 channels, YouTube is competitive on price with DirecTV Now and Sling (Playstation Vue starts at $40 a month for around 55 channels). But its inclusion of the four major broadcast networks and brand cache are what give it a leg up on the other Virtual Multichannel Video Programming Distributor (vMVPDs).\n\nOthers include the major broadcast networks -- CBS, NBC, Fox, and ABC -- but YouTube already has more than 1 billion people watching videos on its various platforms, so people already know the brand.\n\nJefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald cited this as a big reason why it could beat out the competition for subscribers. \"Given the robust content and service offerings on top of YouTube's massive user base and near-ubiquitous distribution platform, YouTube TV could easily surpass sub levels of competitors,\" Fitzgerald wrote in a note after the announcement.\n\nIn addition to the four broadcast networks, YouTube TV is focusing on sports, with a few channels from ESPN and the ability to watch NFL games (thanks to the broadcast networks) on your TV or set-top box (unfortunately not on mobile, due to Verizon's deal with the NFL). Sports is the last bastion holding the cable bundle together, so any focus on sports should be a competitive advantage for YouTube.\n\nIt also has great unlimited cloud DVR capabilities at no cost, another bonus for users. For now, YouTube TV doesn't have a deal with HBO like Sling TV or DirecTV Now do, but YouTube said that it's hopeful it can negotiate that down the line. It does, however, have a deal with CBS-owned Showtime.\n\nThat said, YouTube TV is far from perfect.\n\nI was saddened to see no deals with Turner properties, like TNT or TBS, which limits the impact it can have on sports fans (no MLB playoff games, fewer NBA games, significantly reduced exposure to NCAA March Madness), so YouTube TV is far from perfect.\n\n(For a full list of channels available on YouTube TV, click here.)\n\nThe number of channels is pretty skinny in the initial bundle, compared to its competitors, with Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves noting \"a larger bundle would have appealed to a much bigger portion of the U.S. population, affording Alphabet an opportunity to be more disruptive and giving it more ad inventory to sell.\"\n\nIt's also likely not to be a material driver of revenue and earnings, at least at the beginning. For $35 a month for 44 channels, Hargreaves noted that \"initial margins are likely to be low,\" and some analysts have mentioned this could be a loss leader for YouTube/Google.\n\nIn the end though, YouTube and Google have treasure troves of ad inventory and ad selling experience that its competitors can't match the scale and scope on.\n\nIt has more data on its users than anyone else outside of Facebook (FB), something Hargreaves cited as being a reason it could be \"much more disruptive than other vMVPD offerings to date.\"\n\nThe skinny bundle space is still nascent and there are a lot of factors that could alter the outcome and winners and losers. But YouTube TV, for all the reasons mentioned above, has as good a shot as any at winning.\n\nLet the battle wage on.", "A moat is one of the most important things needed for a company to succeed. The term, coined by Warren Buffett, is a flowery way of describing a competitive advantage, which will protect the company's profits and market share (the castle) from competing businesses.\n\nSnap (NYSE: SNAP) , by its own admission, doesn't have a moat.\n\n\"In a world where anyone can distribute products instantly and provide them for free, the best way to compete is by innovating to create the most engaging products. That's because it's difficult to use distribution or cost as a competitive advantage -- new software is available to users immediately, and for free,\" management wrote in the company's S-1 filing.\n\nIn other words, Snap believes the only way to compete in its market is to out-innovate its competitors like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Google, the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary. But what we've already seen is that simply being innovative isn't enough if a larger competitor can just copy the innovation.\n\nImage source: Snap.\n\nSnap's \"innovation\" budget is significantly smaller than competitors'\n\nSnap spent $184 million on research and development (R&D) last year. That's nothing compared to Alphabet, Facebook, or even Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) . Keep in mind, Twitter is reducing its R&D expenditure.\n\nCompany 2016 R&D Expense R&D as a Percentage of Revenue Snap $0.18 billion 45.4% Alphabet $13.95 billion 15.5% Facebook $5.92 billion 21.4% Twitter $0.71 billion 28.2%\n\nData source: SEC filings and company quarterly reports.\n\nTo be sure, as a percentage of revenue, Snap reinvested much more than any of its competitors. But it's unlikely Snap will continue investing that high of a percentage of revenue into R&D. It simply can't afford to if it wants to show investors that it has any potential at all of becoming profitable at some point.\n\nSnap's cost of revenue is its biggest expense, and it already committed to spending $3 billion on cloud infrastructure over the next five years .\n\nSnap doesn't have the resources to out-innovate its competition, even if it's significantly more focused than any of them.\n\nEven if it does out-innovate...\n\nSnapchat is certainly an innovative app. It's changed the way people communicate, and it quickly grew very popular. Growth has slowed in recent months, however, as its competitors -- specifically Facebook -- have attempted to copy some of its core functionality.\n\nFacebook has been trying to copy Snapchat ever since it tried to buy the company way back in 2013. While several attempts were unsuccessful, Facebook kept at it until it found a winner. Its recent success with Instagram Stories demonstrates the risk Snapchat explains in its S-1. It must keep innovating to stay ahead of competitors copying its product.\n\nBut where Snap claims \"it's difficult to use distribution [...] as a competitive advantage,\" Facebook is showing exactly the opposite. It's developed a huge competitive advantage because it has a launching pad for new products like Instagram Stories or Facebook Live. The company went from nearly 0 to 100 million hours of video views per day in just over a year and a half.\n\nTo say distribution isn't a competitive advantage ignores a significant part of the value of Facebook's massive audience. While not everything it launches succeeds, the odds are stacked in Facebook's favor. That's evident from the success of Instagram Stories and other product features Facebook blatantly borrowed from competitors like Twitter, such as live video and trending topics.\n\nDistribution isn't a competitive advantage for Snap (at least relative to giants like Facebook and Google), but that doesn't mean it's not a competitive advantage for Facebook or Google. That fact makes Snap's admitted lack of a moat even more of a risk for investors.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Of course, he extolled the virtues of his company's cloud platform, called AWS (Amazon Web Services). Meanwhile, the service was experiencing a major outage.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGranted, the impact on Amazon stock was fairly minor. Yet, investors should still be concerned. Let's face it, AWS is critical for AMZN stock.\n\nLast year, this business segment reported a 56% spike in revenues to $12.2 billion and operating income came to $3.1 billion. There are over 1 million active customers. More importantly, Amazon Web Services essentially subsidizes the core ecommerce business - which has razor-thin margins - but also allows for the heavy investments in efforts like video/music streaming, Alexa and devices like the Kindle.\n\nAs for the AWS outage, it lasted roughly four hours and resulted in the disruption of thousands of websites and cloud apps across the US. Some of the high-profile companies that were impacted included Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) and Twilio Inc (NYSE: TWLO ).\n\nAt the heart of this was the failure of the S3 system, which provides for the efficient storage of content. The irony is that AMZN could not even access its own dashboard to deal with the problems - since it was also hosted on the AWS platform!\n\nThe Real Impact?\n\nIt is important to keep the outage in perspective. For the most part, Amazon Web Services has a great track record, with uptime that is over 99%. As a result, whenever there is a major outage, there is quite a bit of buzz.\n\nBesides, AWS is a standout offering. Over the years, AMZN has added great features - such as for data analytics, AI (artificial intelligence) and improved security functions - and has also been diligent with lowering pricing. Yet, this does not mean the outage is trivial. It's reasonable to assume that there are many companies that are evaluating the situation. After all, should there be more usage of alternative systems?\n\nWell, I think so. Note that other internet giants are leveraging their own systems to provide cloud services, as seen with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ). Google is even the main vendor for the fast-growing Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP ), which has signed a $2 billion contract .\n\nOh, and many old-line tech operators have been investing heavily in their cloud systems. Just some include International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ), Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL ), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE: HPE ) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ). All these companies have key advantages like trusted brands, global infrastructures and massive customer bases.\n\nInterestingly enough, these companies also have something else: They provide hybrid solutions, such as a blend of cloud services and on-premise technologies. This means a customer can place their mission-critical systems on private servers, which would mean no disruption if there was an outage of AWS.\n\nBottom Line for AMZN Stock\n\nOK then, with the outage of AWS, there should still not necessarily panic. The market opportunity for the cloud is massive - with plenty of room for multiple players. What's more, the financial costs for the outage will probably be immaterial. According to Global Equities' Trip Chowdhry, he thinks that there could be a 2% drop in revenues for the first quarter .\n\nIf there are a couple more outages, however, then the situation could get dicey. When it comes to cloud hosting, there aren't too many second chances.\n\nTom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbook and is the author of various books, including Taxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ), but the former just eclipsed the latter, and seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nSource: Google\n\nOne of the worst-kept secrets in the industry has been Apple's determination to get into the TV business. The company has been working for years trying to put together an online TV service, hoping to offer 25 channels for between $30 and $40 monthly. That project seemed to have been put on hold when AAPL and broadcasters couldn't reach an agreement on price.\n\nBut Alphabet has just succeeded where Apple failed.\n\nYouTube TV - live TV from over 40 providers including the big networks for $35 per month - is now official.\n\nYouTube TV Takes on Cable\n\nYouTube TV was announced on Tuesday. Launching \"soon\" in the U.S., this is Google's skinny TV bundle for cord cutters. The four major networks are onboard. So is Walt Disney Co's (NYSE: DIS ) ESPN, along with regional sports networks. Google is also including some content from its premium YouTube Red service. All told, there will be over 40 different content providers - not bad for $35 per month.\n\nSubscribers get unlimited cloud DVR storage, search powered by Google's AI, six user accounts (three streams can be active simultaneously) and the ability to watch YouTube TV on a variety of devices including smartphones, tablets, PCs and Google Chromecast.\n\nIn other word, this is pretty much what Apple has been struggling to release.\n\nYouTubeTV is Eerily Similar to Apple's Television Plans\n\nApple has to have been watching Google's YouTube TV announcement with dismay. Its rival beat it to the punch with the streaming TV bundle it had envisioned offering with the Apple TV.\n\nWhat makes it even more galling is how close YouTube TV is to what AAPL was negotiating.\n\nIn May 2015, AAPL and CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS ) were in talks about a subscription Apple television streaming service, but money was reportedly a sticking point . In December of that year, CBS CEO Les Moonves confirmed to Business Insider that his network had been in talks with Apple, and were close to settling on a monthly price to charge consumers. Moonves was throwing around $35 - exactly the price that YouTube TV is charging.\n\nApple balked. Apparently Google was waiting in the wings.\n\nWhere Does This Leave AAPL and Its TV Strategy?\n\nAt this point, Apple's entire television strategy seems to be struggling.\n\nThere was hope that the new Apple TV that launched in 2015 would come with a streaming TV bundle. That didn't happen. Now Apple's set-top streamer is suffering from disappointing sales. The box costs twice what Google and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) charge for their streamers, but lacks the 4K support rivals offer.\n\nLast year, AAPL was showing off a new TV app that would serve as a hub for streaming content, tracking use across multiple services and devices. But it failed to get buy-in from Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ), making its usefulness questionable.\n\nGoogle's YouTube TV launch is the icing on the cake.\n\nWhere Can Apple Go From Here?\n\nDon't expect Apple to give up on its plans, of course.\n\nThe signs of a renewed push toward taking over your living room began last month. Apple hired the former head of Amazon's Fire TV to take over as the head of marketing for Apple TV. This move has raised expectations that AAPL will revamp its Apple TV hardware. It also freed up the previous head of Apple TV to help lead Apple's efforts to sign content deals - something he had considerable experience in from his previous role as senior VP of content distribution at Hulu .\n\nWhile YouTube TV offers a fixed content bundle, AAPL had always pushed for subscribers having an option to choose their own bundle, Moonves says. If the company can accomplish that goal, it still can position an Apple television streaming service as being something unique.\n\nWith YouTube TV, Google may have beaten Apple to the punch when it comes to being first of the tech giants to offer a cheap way to cut the cable, but the war is likely just beginning.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Just Succeeded Where Apple Inc.

It runs on nearly nine of every 10 mobile phones, worldwide. But that's never really been a primary reason to by GOOGL stock … or at least not directly.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFrom an investor standpoint, you would still rather buy Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) because Apple monetizes iOS the way a butcher monetizes a pig. Google, on the other hand, just gives its OS away to OEMs.\n\nThat's not to say Google doesn't make any money off Android, though. Simply by offering its search engine and Google Play store through the software, GOOGL rakes in billions of dollars.\n\nBut, the Android ecosystem is extremely fragmented. Compared to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) - which runs its own store and has its own browser and search engine - Google's take is a mere fraction.\n\nWhat if that changed? Would it mean anything to GOOGL stock holders?\n\nControlling Android\n\nWhile Google is not yet charging OEMs to use its software, the company has been quietly trying to gain control of its creation. Management is pushing OEMs to deliver security updates on a monthly basis. This is important, as crooks push malware onto older, unpatched phones.\n\nGoogle's newest handset, the Pixel, is designed to be as good as an iPhone. Reviews, however, have been mixed. The company is even trying to get back into China through its OEMs (the world's largest market tossed Google back in 2010 over censorship).\n\nStill, Google has its work cut out for itself. Samsung Electronic (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) dominates the Android market. OEMs and consumers see this fragmentation as an advantage, even though it allows bugs to multiply because they may appear on one device or brand only.\n\nThe operating system itself is hopelessly fragmented. Google is only now rolling out its Marshmallow and Nougat versions of Android and still developing the \"O\" version , while many users have devices that still run the KitKat version. My own Android phone runs on Lollipop, (simply because it lacks the storage to run anything newer).\n\nThe way Google eventually gets its arms around all of this may be through Andromeda , an operating system for both Android and its laptop Chromebook devices. Unifying software platforms would give Alphabet Inc the kind of power that Microsoft only dreamed of with its Windows operating system.\n\nBottom Line on GOOGL Stock\n\nIf Alphabet were to start monetizing Android, would investors even notice?\n\nAlphabet continues to grow at 20% per year, powered by advertising on its main Search site and YouTube. The company brings approximately 25 cents of every dollar to the net income line, its balance sheet carries almost no debt, and operating cash flow is ridiculous ($36 billion last year alone, more than twice what it achieved just two years prior). In 2016, Alphabet had revenue in excess of $90 billion.\n\nOver the last year, the price of GOOGL stock is up nearly 17%, and the non-voting GOOG shares are up even more. The company's market cap of $577 billion trails only that of Apple. Six months ago, they were nearly level , but that was before Apple's recent run to new highs.\n\nAlphabet Inc CFO Ruth Porat's program of paring non-performing assets and forcing \"other bets\" (like the company's self-driving car unit, now called Waymo) to make it on their own has paid off. Google's investment balances have been growing steadily, along with its asset base.\n\nWhat's most amazing is how Alphabet continues to underperform. Android is not a major profit center, and Google Cloud is often considered third in the market, behind Amazon and Microsoft. Google was late to the voice party with Google Assistant, which allowed Amazon to get the drop on it. Plus, the hardware line is loaded with \"me too\" products, and GOOGL leads in precisely zero categories.\n\nStill, Porat has performed well in providing discipline to Google executives, but she has not propelled Alphabet to market leadership outside of Search.\n\nIf assets such as Android became true profit centers, GOOGL stock would be well on its way to $1,000 per share and becoming the first trillion-dollar company.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

In the markets, there is an elite group of companies that define their respective industries. For example, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) owns e-commerce, while Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) has forever changed social media. And for now, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is the king of smart devices. But in my humble opinion, GOOGL stock tops them all.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDon't get me wrong as this is not a slight against any of the above companies. Just let me forward a very basic observation - all these other names essentially require the internet to function. If not directly, then certainly, access to the internet represents their core marketing message.\n\nBut what happens when you own the internet? That's a theoretical question to everyone except GOOGL.\n\nAs I mentioned in a prior contribution, the dominance of the GOOGL search engine is unparalleled. The margin between Alphabet Inc and the next biggest competitor, Bing, is a whopping 300%. It just gets worse as you go down the rankings. By the time you hit fifth place, it's just not even worth considering. In any other industry, such a statement would be the death knell for the competition.\n\nEssentially, GOOGL stock is an investment in life itself. Many people thought that the name change to Alphabet - a play on the financial term \"alpha\" and the gambling term \"bet\" - was cheeky and a bit ridiculous. But it also signified that Alphabet Inc could do whatever it wants because no one can stop it. GOOGL stock was essentially either an asset or a threat, depending on your perspective.\n\nVolatility Is a Risk to GOOGL Stock\n\nUnfortunately, where it matters most for investors, GOOGL stock hasn't always shown its best stuff. True, it's early into 2017, and so far, it's up over 4% year-to-date. Keep that up every month and you're guaranteed a stellar annual return. But Alphabet Inc has also been inconsistent , as InvestorPlace contributor Chris Tyler points out. For example, GOOGL was looking at closing January at over 6%. Instead, it only secured 1.4%.\n\nOn a strictly nominal basis, that's not much of a swing. But on percentage basis, it's a much different story. It has been well over a decade since Alphabet stock introduced itself to the markets. The crazy dynamics involved in a fresh tech company should be over by now. Today, GOOGL and its subsidiaries are comparable to General Electric Company (NYSE: GE ) if GE was a little more hip.\n\nBut with great size comes great envy. Alphabet Inc now faces a fundamental problem. Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL ) wants to reengage a court ruling that went in favor of GOOGL. At issue is the company's generous use of Oracle's Java software in order to design the Android operating system. GOOGL contends that using Java - which is open-source - is fair game. Oracle contends that it violates the \"fair use \" component of copyright law.\n\nFor those that acquired GOOGL stock, it's an ugly situation that might be a legitimate risk. Here's the thing - whether it's legitimate or not doesn't matter. If the markets think it's a problem, it's a problem. That makes the sighting of what appears to be a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern (between early December until now) a curious development.\n\nDon't Panic on Alphabet Inc\n\nGenerally, it's not the best idea to buy an investment with baggage. Certainly, it's not a good idea when the baggage is from a giant company like Oracle. Ditto that for its 6'3″ CEO that doesn't come off as someone you want to mess with. In other words, GOOGL stock has some challenges.\n\nI also don't think it's a coincidence that the head-and-shoulders pattern is emerging right now. If I'm looking at Alphabet Inc purely as a swing trade, I wouldn't go full bore at this juncture. I expect shares to at least test its 50-day moving average, which stands just under $800. It would not shock me, however, to see GOOGL stock slide towards its 200-day moving average, which is around $763.\n\nAgain, that's looking at Alphabet Inc from a short-term perspective. For those that have a wider time horizon, the king of the internet is as strong technically as it is fundamentally. Aside from some bumps in the road, GOOGL stock is enjoying clear blue skies. Most importantly, those bumps have never affected Alphabet Inc in a permanent way.\n\nThe bottom line here is that I would be content holding GOOGL stock. Further, any dips are justifiable buying opportunities, not mere contrarianism for its own sake. Alphabet Inc is going to $1,000 - just try to ignore the turbulence as best you can.\n\nAs of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Is Still a Top Tech Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "I bought a used car recently, and a few days after I brought it home, a friend asked me, \"Do you think this is the last car you'll ever buy?\"\n\nWe talk a lot about self-driving cars, so I knew exactly where he was going with his question. He was hinting at the fact that both autonomous car technologies and ride-sharing services are advancing so quickly that by the time I'd be in the market for another vehicle, I might not actually need to buy one.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBy 2035, the IHS estimates there will be 76 million cars on the road worldwide with some level of autonomy . Even now, semi-autonomous cars that can keep themselves in their lanes, automatically brake in emergency situations, and slow down to match the speed of the car in front of them can be purchased for as little as $20,000.\n\nAnd as genuinely driverless cars get cheaper and become ubiquitous, you and I may opt out of monthly car payments and opt-in to a monthly mileage subscription service instead.\n\nAutomakers are investing in this future\n\nTo understand how it's possible that we could soon live in a world where most people don't own cars, we need to look no further than what the automakers themselves are doing.\n\nElon Musk's recently updated version of Tesla 's(NASDAQ: TSLA) master plan includes details on a new service: When the company's vehicles become fully autonomous (by 2018 or 2019, according to Musk), Tesla owners will be able to allow their vehicles to drive themselves around and be rented out by other people.\n\nAs Musk wrote:\n\nYou will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost.\n\nImage source: Tesla.\n\nMusk also said that Tesla would deploy its own fleet of driverless vehicles for rent in areas where there was more demand for Tesla vehicles than privately owned cars could meet, so that \"you can always hail a ride from us no matter where you are.\" Remember, this isn't the catchphrase of a taxi company, nor even a ride-hailing service -- but rather the direction where Musk sees his automaker headed.\n\nAnd just in case think this mentality is unique to the innovative Tesla, consider what General Motors (NYSE: GM) is doing. The giant automaker launched a ride-sharing service last year called Maven, which allows some GM owners to rent out their vehicles when they're not in use. The cars don't drive themselves yet, but the company sees it as a first step toward a future where people are less inclined to own cars.\n\nIn a press release at the time, GM said that more than 25 million of its customers around the world will use some form of shared mobility by 2020, and describe Maven as \"a key element of our strategy to changing ownership models in the automotive industry.\" Maven has spread to 17 cities across North America in just 11 months, has 22,000 members, and has been used for 57 million miles of driving.\n\nNot to be outdone, Ford (NYSE: F) has launched i ts own ride-sharing service, and is developing autonomous cars just like GM. Ford has made it clear that it intends to launch a \"high-volume\" driverless car paired with ride-hailing and ride-sharing services by 2021. The company is already testing 30 self-driving Fusion Hybrids in several states, and plans to triple the number of test vehicles this year.\n\nOther automakers are moving in this direction as well. Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU) is working with Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google to test a fleet of 100 self-driving minivans that will be the basis for a ride-hailing service set to launch later this year. It's still unclear what the service will look like, or if Fiat Chrysler will play a critical role in it, but what is clear is that the automaker believes in the viability of Waymo's cars-as-a-service goal.\n\nWill this really end car ownership?\n\nIt's hard to answer this question conclusively, of course. After all, most people haven't even seen a fully autonomous vehicle on the road, let alone ridden in one.\n\nBut John Zimmer, the co-founder and president of ride-hailing company Lyft, believes that by 2025 \"private car ownership will all-but end in major U.S. cities.\" Lyft expects the majority of its vehicles to be self-driving by 2021, and rival Uber is testing similar strategies as well.\n\nOthers have set similar timelines for the demise of car ownership. Georg Bauer, who has held executive positions at Daimler, BMW, and Tesla told Business Insider last year that he thinks car ownership could be dead within five to 10 years.\n\nGovernment regulations and our own apprehension about giving up control over our vehicles may preserve the widespread car ownership culture for longer than some expect. But what's crystal clear is that tech companies and automakers alike are betting on an automotive future that looks very different than today. Like many things, the transition from owning cars to renting driverless ones on an as-needed basis will likely occur in stages -- but let's be clear, things are certainly moving in this direction. And I, for one, would welcome a world without car payments.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Tesla\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The move indicates the company is edging closer to a potential clash with ride-hailing service Uber Technologies Inc.\n\nGoogle is targeting launch of the Waze carpool service in several U.S. cities and Latin America over the next several months, Waze Chief Noam Bardin said in an interview to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBardin reportedly said that the move to expand the carpool service comes after testing of the service in Israel and San Francisco Bay area met expectations.\n\nIn 2016, Google commenced a pilot car-pooling program around its California headquarters and later expanded it to San Francisco.\n\nWaze promotes the service as Waze Carpool, noting that the service will enable to connect drivers with fellow commuters heading in the same direction. This is unlike Uber and its crosstown San Francisco rival Lyft Inc., which each largely operate as on-demand taxi businesses.\n\nThe Waze pilot program charged riders below the federal standard mileage rate of 54 cents a mile, thus discouraging drivers from making a living by operating as taxi drivers.\n\nNevertheless, Google's expansion into ride-sharing could intensify its rivalry with Uber. In 2013, Google had invested $258 million in Uber when the two companies were allies.\n\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\n\nhttp://www.rttnews.com\n\nThis article appears in: Politics , Stocks , Stocks", "Baidu ( BIDU ) is scheduled to announced its Q4 and full year earnings on Thursday, February 23. The company has witnessed strong growth in its transaction services and online video streaming businesses through the first three quarters of the year. Although Baidu's top line growth in recent months has been hindered by a revision in regulatory policy that drove down marketing revenue, the company has continued to witness strong growth in non-core revenue streams.\n\nOutlook For Q4 & Full Year\n\nThrough the first three quarters of the year, Baidu's search services revenue growth has been hindered by a revision in regulatory policy that drove down marketing revenues through the quarter. In China, online ads and marketingpractices for medical, pharmaceutical, and healthcare products and services on online platforms now have to go through mandatory regulatory approvals. This trend is expected to continue through the December quarter as well, with the most severe impact expected in the coming quarter.\n\nBaidu has witnessed solid revenue growth in two of its smaller revenue streams over the the last 2-3 years - its online video streaming platform iQiyi, which is similar to Netflix ( NFLX ), and transaction services. Both segments witnessed over 70% revenue growth in 2015, which was slightly lower than the triple digit growth in the previous year. Baidu has pumped in money to these divisions to develop the infrastructure for its video streaming and transaction services platforms to fuel growth. Furthermore, Baidu has also invested heavily in content acquisition costs, bandwidth costs for the video business and traffic acquisition costs for the transaction business, in addition to absorbing high marketing expenses for both. As a result, the revenue surge in these segments is complemented by operating losses. These divisions are likely to be operating at a loss over next couple of years as well.\n\nSince Baidu has operated its streaming video business at a loss over the past few years, there were reports in December last year that the company could spin off the iQiyi division. Earlier last year, a consortium of investors led by Baidu CEO Robin Li wanted to buy out the iQiyi business for $2.3 billion, but later dropped the bid after investors claimed that the price was too low. Various market research firms and hedge funds estimate iQiyi's valuation at anywhere between $2.5 billion and $5.5 billion. More recently, Baidu announced that it has raised funding for the video streaming business which would help it acquire more content and help the company focus on long-term growth.\n\nBaidu's management expects Q4 revenues to be around RMB 18.1 billion (or $2.7 billion at an exchange rate of RMB 6.67 per $1.00). As a result, full year revenues could be around RMB 70.4 billion or $10.7 billion, which is slightly lower than the Reuters' consensus estimate of around RMB 71.4 billion. For the full year, we expect the smaller revenue streams to drive most of the company's revenue growth.\n\nSee our complete analysis for Baidu\n\nView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):\n\nGlobal Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap\n\nMore Trefis Research", "Corporate disclosure and shareholders' value creation\n\nThe positive outcomes of discretionary disclosure are various and can benefit both companies and their shareholders. I will focus here on the benefits for the latter.\n\nWhilst the mandatory disclosure is imposed by legislation or regulation (i.e. the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the U.S. and the European Transparency Directive in the E.U.), the discretionary disclosure consists of any additional information a company's management intends to provide the investors with.\n\nMost of the studies show that a disclosure increase creates value for the shareholders. For instance, a study conducted by Standard & Poor's shows (see the chart below) that companies with higher transparency and disclosure (measured by the S&P transparency score) have a higher P/BV ratio.\n\nSource: Standard & Poor's\n\nThe S&P transparency score takes into account the quantity of disclosure: the more information is given (i.e. information about ownership structure and shareholders' rights, information about board and management process, financial and operational information), the higher the score is. The same research also proves that firms with high disclosure and transparency have a lower market risk as showed in the chart below:\n\nSource: Standard & Poor's\n\nOther studies focusing on events such as the introduction of regulation (i.e. the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) also verified and confirmed that disclosure either mandatory or discretionary creates value for the shareholders.\n\nA crucial role in conveying the disclosure to the investor is played by the Investor Relations.\n\nThe National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI) defines the Investor Relations as the:\n\n\"Strategic management responsibility that integrates finance, communication, marketing and securities law compliance to enable the most effective two-way communication between a company, the financial community, and other constituencies, which ultimately contributes to a company's securities achieving fair valuation\".\n\nBased on this definition, we can assume that if a company supplies its shareholders with a complete, timely, reliable, punctual and adequate flow of financial information related to its business, it will definitely help investors make better investment decisions and allow its stock price to align progressively with its fair value.\n\nIn this sense, investor relations help share prices to achieve a fair valuation. Value gaps between market value and fair value tend to diminish because investors believe management can accomplish what it says through the disclosure ( management credibility).\n\nA flat or negative quarter will not be an automatic sell signal because investors will seek for explanations by the management and, when convinced that fundamentals are still strong and growing, they will be more likely to hold their shares or even increase their positions because they trust the company's management and, today more than ever, in the fallout of financial crisis, markets run more on trust than money. As a matter of fact, the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing five years of economic turmoil clearly revealed the insufficiency of disclosures, especially in the case of financial institutions.\n\nMore transparency\n\nFirst of all, making more financial information available means more transparency for its investors who can make more appropriate and accurate investment decisions based on a larger amount of data to evaluate and compare.\n\nVoluntary disclosure decreases the investor's information asymmetry to the extent of its usefulness. The degree of its usefulness depends on its relevance, reliability, timeliness, and clarity.\n\nMoreover, the market tends to value more companies presenting clear and easy-to-understand financial statements than those filing complex and opaque ones.\n\nMany are the communication channels through which investor relations can convey the company's disclosure to the financial community. The main channels employed are the press releases, investor and analyst meetings, earnings guidelines, investor presentations, and the Investor Relations page on the company's website.\n\nInvestors are often concerned not with past earnings, but rather with future ones, thus the way a company communicates that financial information through the communication channels mentioned above might convince or not the investors to buy its stocks.\n\nIn addition, investing in businesses which implement an effective voluntary disclosure policy means investing into firms managed by credible and reliable managers; in other words, transparency leads to credibility and trust.\n\nMore liquidity\n\nThe implementation of an effective disclosure policy aimed to reduce the information asymmetries between management and investors will entail a higher liquidity of the shares and increase the company's visibility, thereby attracting more analysts to cover the stock and more institutional investors to buy the company's shares whose price will eventually go up with a clear and obvious advantage for all the investors.\n\nA more liquid stock also means a reduced bid-offer spread (the empirical measure of market liquidity) for the investors, which means a cheaper cost of trading. In conclusion, an effective disclosure policy reduces information asymmetry and increases liquidity in the equity market.\n\nLower debt\n\nIncreased liquidity also brings about a lower cost of capital, thus the company will have to bear a smaller burden of debt, which is great news for the company's investors.\n\nThe majority of studies have confirmed that the cost of capital decreases as the company's risk perception dissipates within the market and, as a consequence, the firm will be able not only to finance its investments at a lower cost, but also raise equity capital more easily. Ultimately, disclosure facilitates external financing, investments, and growth, which will be eventually reflected in the rise of the stock price.\n\nBy no surprise, the leading IT consulting firm Infosys ( INFY ) ranking among the three top companies for disclosure on its domestic market (BSE100) has approximately a 5.90% weighted average cost of capital vs. a 45.20% return on invested capital. In other words it can generate excess returns on the investments 7.6 times more than its cost of capital. Besides that, Infosys can sport a 10-year track record of consistent growth in sales, profits, free cash flow and dividends.\n\nStock price appreciation and lower volatility\n\nFirms with high levels of disclosure have a higher association with stock price increase than those with low levels of information disclosure.\n\nA very interesting study published in the \" Financial Management \" journal compares an investment made in high-disclosure companies with an investment made in low-disclosure companies, and it shows that the high-disclosure portfolio outperforms the low-disclosure portfolio by an average of 7% per year over a period of 14 years.\n\nOther studies have proved that more transparent firms benefit from a reduction in the volatility of returns which for the investors means less risk and more stable returns over time.\n\nThe increase of liquidity attracts more institutional investors who generate more volume and therefore push the stocks' price up. In addition, the increase of the analyst coverage and the set up of target prices might also contribute in putting further upwards pressure on the stocks' price.\n\nThe status quo of disclosure and transparency in the corporate world\n\nIn 2014 Transparency International (( TI )), the watchdog that monitors the international corruption among countries and corporations published a ranking of the top 10 most transparent companies and the least transparent firms in the world among the 124 largest publicly-listed companies based on an index which takes into account anti-corruption programs adopted by the ranked companies and their overall organizational transparency. Seven of the top companies are from Europe while eight of the bottom 10 companies are from Asia.\n\n(click to enlarge)\n\n(click to enlarge)\n\nTI also published a report whose findings are very interesting but also surprising.\n\nIn terms of sectors, telecoms and oil/gas companies lead the way whilst consumer services, financial, tech and healthcare firms are the least transparent. Geographically, EU companies score highest in organizational transparency with an average of 54% and U.S. firms score the lowest at 24%.\n\nU.S. tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Google ( GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) all score less than three out of 10.\n\nAnother American famous firm, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A ) (BRK.B), Warren Buffett's conglomerate, also had a bad performance, ranking among the last 10.\n\n\"Tech companies are driving changes that are making our societies more open and accountable. They should be setting an example for other companies on transparency\" said Cobus de Swardt, TI's managing director.\n\nThe report also shows the positive impact of strong legislation, with U.K. companies scoring 90% on average compared to 20% in China.\n\nAccording to the report, financial sector companies still should be more transparent and accountable to the public if they want to win back public trust which is yet faltering.\n\nThe report urges multinational companies to seek more transparency by disclosing the subsidiaries through which they operate in different countries which are often impossible to trace. Obtaining this information through a country-by-country report is important since it would help people understand the impact of multinational companies in their own country. In addition, through a full disclosure of corporate holdings, investors can gain more knowledge of financial flows such as intra-company transfers and payments to governments.\n\nWhile all the evaluated German companies disclose all their subsidiaries abroad, no Chinese company discloses any financial data in any of the 59 foreign countries where they operate.\n\nIn the country-by-country disclosure ranking, more than 50 companies scored an embarrassing 0% and only three performed above the 50% level, the pre-tax profits being the least disclosed financial information while the revenues being the most disclosed. Amazon, Apple, Google and IBM all fail to publish a full list of countries in which their subsidiaries operate.\n\nThe watchdog in its report also highlights the importance for the investors to be aware of the anti-corruption policies established by the companies they want to invest in since this information will help them evaluate better the risk associated with the investment. U.K. companies perform best on anti-corruption whilst Chinese and Japanese companies are the poorest performers in both dimensions.\n\nIn conclusion, investing in companies with a high rate of discretionary disclosure and transparency can dramatically increase the overall shareholders' value and substantially reduce the risk associated with the investment.\n\nSee also The iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF Is A Speculative Buy on seekingalpha.com", "Looking at options trading activity among components of the S&P 500 index, there is noteworthy activity today in Dow Chemical Co.

Snap (NYSE: SNAP) will price its shares on March 1 after the market closes , which means investors should be able to buy shares on March 2.\n\nSnap expects to price its shares between $14 and $16, and it will sell 200 million shares with 30 million in reserve to raise as much as $3.7 billion. The share price range represents a market cap between $19.5 billion and $22.2 billion. That's short of the $25 billion sources originally reported late last year, and very close to the valuation at which Snap raised funds during its series F round about nine months ago.\n\nHow does Snap's IPO pricing compare to competing digital advertisers, and should investors grab shares on March 2?\n\nImage source: Snap\n\nA look at valuation\n\nAt its IPO, Snap will be worth about $21 billion. That's a bit more than Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) , but considerably less than ad giants Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .\n\nCompany Valuation Price-to-Sales Ratio Snap $21 billion* 51.9 Twitter $11.7 billion 4.6 Facebook $386.5 billion 14.1 Google (C shares) $580.9 billion 6.4\n\nData source: Snap S-1/A and Yahoo! Finance *Based on the midpoint of Snap's expected pricing range.\n\nDespite its relatively small valuation, investors will still be paying a huge premium for Snap based on its sales. Last year, the company brought in just $405 million in revenue. By comparison, Twitter brought in more than six times as much ($2.5 billion). Snap and its underwriters think a dollar of its sales is worth more than 10 times as much as Twitter's.\n\nGranted, Twitter is expected to see sales decline this year, while analysts believe Snap could grow revenue around 150%. Still, Snap will trade at a huge premium to the still rapidly growing Facebook and Alphabet, which are expected to grow sales 37% and 18%, respectively.\n\nBut the IPO pricing is still attractive\n\nSnap's IPO pricing is still somewhat attractive however, if but for one reason. It's nearly the same valuation as its last round of funding. Snap's trailing 12 months of revenue for that round was just $93.5 million. Snap will IPO at about one-quarter the multiple of its last funding round.\n\nIn that light, Snap's price looks much more reasonable. If some of the smartest venture capitalists were willing to invest when Snap's latest advertising products were still at their earliest potential, it may well be worth it for investors now that Snap has proven those products work. And if they can get it at the same price, so much the better.\n\nYou probably won't get Snap shares at $16\n\nUnfortunately, it's highly unlikely you'll be able to buy shares of Snap at its IPO price on March 2. Since its planning to price shares around the same price as its last round of funding, Snap is potentially setting the stock up for a pop in the stock price before it opens on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThat's good for Snap. Even though Snap will only receive funds at the price it sets on March 1, a first-day pop in the stock price makes it look much more attractive. (Remember what happened to Facebook stock after its botched IPO?)\n\nSnap itself is only selling 145 million to 175 million shares of the company's 1.2 billion shares outstanding, so it's not leaving too much money on the table, either, by keeping its IPO price low. The other 55 million shares will come from early investors and company officials.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to have a broker that's offering you a chance to get in on the Snap IPO price, it may be worth considering buying a stake in the company. Even at $16 per share, however, it's still extremely risky. But don't be surprised if Snap doesn't trade publicly for that price for a long time -- if ever.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .", "Warren Buffett is well-known for having, among the core tenets of his investment strategy, a preference for companies with serious \"competitive moats\" -- attributes that give them the ability to sustainably keep ahead of their competition. But based on his rues, Buffett would never invest in an emerging industry like self-driving cars, and his competitive moat ideas don't necessarily hold water in this world. If you're a fan of the Oracle of Omaha, beware of following his investment philosophy into these three mistakes.\n\n1. Focusing too much on size\n\nImage source: Alphabet (Waymo)\n\nEconomies of scale are an important indicator for almost any company. As the logic goes, the bigger a company is, the greater its ability to cut per-unit costs. Ford's (NYSE: F) ability to keep its car costs lower than Tesla Motors' (NASDAQ: TSLA) , for example, isn't just based on the fact that it produces more economically designed vehicles. It's also due to the fact that Ford produced 1.5 million cars in the third quarter of 2016, compared to the 24,800 cars Tesla Motors delivered during the same period.\n\nBut scalability in the driverless car industry doesn't necessarily have anything to do with car sales. The automaker with the best technology may ultimately come out ahead. Technology is scalable at almost no cost. When Tesla Motors wirelessly uploads its latest software to its already-sold vehicles around the world, the company pays nearly nothing in per-unit costs. The race to build the best driverless car at this stage has much more to do with technology than with numbers of vehicles sold, and the quantity of cars a company has sold thus far isn't a indicator for which company is best placed to scale in the future.\n\n2. Exaggerating the value of network effects\n\nWhat network?\n\nNetwork effects are often touted as one of the strongest competitive moats around. Facebook , an actual social network, perfectly defines the allure of the network effect. If everyone is using a specific product or platform, it can be extremely difficult for another company to make inroads.\n\nAt first glance, driverless cars seem to be an excellent opportunity to build network effects. If one company's cars all \"talk\" to each other as they navigate the roads, they'll get to their destinations faster and more safely than competitors' -- right? Wrong. Driverless car technology must necessarily take into account public safety, and unique, exclusionary networks fly in the face of a universal platform for safe self-driving cars. Automakers engaged in this space already know this; it's why Ford, Tesla, and others are equipping their driverless cars with the best real-world object detection technology available.\n\nWhen Ford announced earlier last week that it would invest $1 billion over five years in Argo AI, it wasn't because the startup has thousands of self-driving cars on the road -- it was because the company's robotics expertise \"gives Ford a distinct competitive advantage at the intersection of the automotive and technology industries,\" explained Ford Chief Technology Officer Raj Nair in a press release. Likewise, Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) spinoff Waymo isn't relying on Google's treasure troves of data to guide its vehicles as they drive around. Instead, Waymo cars are equipped with sensors and software designed to detect obstacles up to \"two football fields away in all directions.\" Ford, Alphabet, Tesla Motors, and others aren't interested in network effects in this arena. They're interested in their cars having the most acute local-area awareness they can contain.\n\n3. Expecting government regulation to limit competition\n\nRegular regulation\n\nRegulation can provide some of the widest competitive moats around. If only one company is able to meet all the regulatory requirements of being in a business, it's essentially illegal for others to try to compete with it. The driverless car industry recognizes this, and is making moves to ensure a level playing field for all involved.\n\nAlphabet, Ford, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo Cars joined together last April to create the \" Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets , \" a lobbying group whose stated mission is to \"work with lawmakers, regulators, and the public to realize the safety and societal benefits of self-driving vehicles.\" These companies are interested in standardizing national policy with simple and low-cost barriers to entry for all interested automakers. So for Buffett fans looking to back the company with the strongest regulation-related advantages, know that some of the biggest names in the business are working proactively to push policies that ensure no company can ever build a regulatory moat.\n\nPicking the right self-driving car stock\n\nWarren Buffett is an incredible investor, but he doesn't have answers for every industry. There are many open questions around self-driving cars, and some companies are more poised to profit than others. Rather than sticking to one-size-fits-all investment mantras, equip yourself with the facts you need to know, make informed investments, and set your portfolio to auto-pilot for years to come.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(NASDAQ: AAPL )? With AAPL stock now trading at all-time highs, driven by its 27% one-month rise, investors want to know whether it's too late to bite.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nApple stock, which already ranks as the best-performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , closed Monday at $139.34.\n\nAAPL shares have soared nearly 21% year-to-date, crushing not only all the major indexes, but also the performances of FANG stocks Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ).\n\nAll told, the Cupertino-based tech giant, which has been on a winning streak over the last year, has made investors tons of money with more than 35% returns. And with some patience, there's still at least 15% gains to be had as AAPL stock is poised to reach $160 in the next 12 to 18 months. How's it going to get there?\n\nApple Stock's Strength\n\nAside from the recent endorsement Apple received from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who revealed on CNBC last week that his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.A ) (NYSE: BRK.B ) conglomerate more than doubled its stake in Apple to 133 million shares worth around $17 billion. AAPL has its iPhone 8 and a host of other tailwinds to propel the revenue higher. Rumors suggest that the tenth-anniversary iPhone, which will feature a new OLED display, could sell for more than $1,000 per device.\n\nAs such, given that Apple, which sold more than 78 million phones in 2016's holiday quarter, has surpassed Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) in market share, according to data just released research firm Gartner, the company should have no problems selling the new iPhones and generating huge profits. What's more, Apple has also become more than just an iPhone shop.\n\nIn its fiscal first quarter, Apple's Services revenue, which includes Apple Music, the App Store, iCloud, Apple Care and Apple Pay, grew 17.5% year-over-year to $7.17 billion, topping forecasts of $6.91 billion. With Services quickly becoming the company's second-largest business segment, Apple appears better balanced going forward. And all of this makes AAPL stock less risky, despite its all-time high status.\n\nBottom Line for AAPL Stock\n\nWhen factoring Apple's massive cash stockpile of more than $250 billion, AAPL stock - despite trading at all-time highs - still looks like a bargain. Based on fiscal 2017 consensus estimates of $8.94 per share, Apple stock is priced at just 15.5x earnings-per-share, which is about four points below the S&P 500 index. Assuming AAPL was priced on par with the rest of the market, the shares would trade today at around $170. In other words, even the a $160 target looks too conservative.\n\nAs of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Could Rise More Than 15% appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFew names in the markets have almost universal appeal. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is one of them. Sure, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) products have more appeal, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is more popular and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is more engaging, but let's give credit where credit is due. Most of us have grown up with Microsoft programs, and we continue to use them frequently to this day.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOf course, emotional sentiment only goes so far. To prove its relevance in a changing world, Microsoft must deliver the goods. For most of this decade, the results for Microsoft stock have been fantastic.\n\nWe're talking five out of seven years in the black, with an average annual profit of nearly 14%. In addition, MSFT stock has enjoyed four consecutive years of double-digit growth.\n\nI don't care how many caveats you can mention about the proverbial old dog … that's a trick that's tough to master at any age. Seemingly, the change at the top of the Microsoft war room, from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella, is working wonders. Most importantly, the willingness to aggressively push into new territory is encouraging for potential Microsoft shareholders.\n\nInvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth took this confidence further by declaring that MSFT stock will hit $80 this year . Is this wishful thinking, or is there more to this than mere bravado?\n\nChallenges Facing MSFT stock\n\nFirst things first - I admire the guts Ashworth displayed. That's putting yourself out there and giving clarity to your point of view. It's something I wish I could see in Washington, but that's a whole different ballgame.\n\nWith MSFT stock specifically, the bullish argument is an easy one, but so is the cautious approach. Shares have soared despite the wave of competition in the consumer tech sector. InvestorPlace contributor Vince Martin speaks for a lot of people when he wrote , \"I continue to be surprised at the strength shown by Microsoft stock. MSFT stock has risen roughly 150% in just four years - despite little movement in profits.\"\n\nThe lack of fundamental growth is even more perplexing when you consider Microsoft's position within the fierce environment. The company is either lagging, or is getting challenged by rising up-and-comers. Martin writes:\n\n\"For Office 365, Tableau Software Inc (NYSE: DATA ) is challenging Excel - and 27% revenue growth in 2016 suggests DATA is taking share from MSFT. Behemoths like Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL ) and many others are in the cloud space. Microsoft's Dynamics CRM product is a distant second to salesforce.com, inc . (NYSE: CRM ).\"\n\nA huge concern for those trading MSFT stock is the market capitalization. I'm not a fan of focusing on any one metric. Still, with its equity valued at half a trillion dollars, you have to take a step back. Is Microsoft stock really worth that much?\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge Keep in mind that despite four consecutive years of double-digit growth, the magnitude has also declined. The first strike was 39.5% in 2013, followed by performances of 28.4%, 21.9% and 16.5%.\n\nMicrosoft Stock Is a Proven Winner\n\nAdmittedly, that's not the direction the trend should go. Nevertheless, I think Ashworth is going to be a happy camper. Like other tech names, Microsoft stock starts off the year fairly slowly. For example, its first quarter returns are a relatively pedestrian 8%.\n\nBut at year's end, the average return jumps up to 30.7%, nearly four times higher. That also means that those who are concerned about this year's slow start for MSFT stock shouldn't be.\n\nThe other attribute that is remarkable about Microsoft is its resiliency. Between 2000 and 2011, MSFT stock suffered a negative Q1 performance ten times. But in four of those instances, shares managed to claw back positive returns for the year. That provides a lot of security for those making strongly optimistic calls for Microsoft stock.\n\nWhile investors have reason to look at MSFT cautiously, I think Wall Street is giving Nadella and company a fair shake. They want to see what it can do with its long-term strategy, and the signs are encouraging. A prime example is Microsoft's high-profile acquisition of LinkedIn . By integrating its intellectual capital with Microsoft's vast networks, it can do serious damage in the social media sphere.\n\nOverall, $80 for Microsoft stock is very reasonable. Although not dominant, it's competing well in some of the most exciting and high-growth sectors. Both the company and the markets are loving the change in leadership and culture. Finally, Microsoft continues to find ways to do well, even in the most trying of circumstances. The only question is, can I be the first to call $100 in 2018?\n\nAs of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Looks Overbought. It Isn't. appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nShares of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) rebounded nicely following their short-lived but sharp post-earnings selloff in late January. This very ability of GOOGL stock to recover so quickly speaks to underlying demand and a multimonth uptrend that active investors and traders must respect until proven otherwise.\n\nWhen I last discussed Alphabet stock on Jan. 9 , I said that shares appeared to have good upside potential into late January. I wanted to target the $845-$850 area before the Jan. 26 earnings report. The stock reached the upper end of this price range by Jan. 24.\n\nNote that this was specifically a pre-earnings trade; the goal was to get out before Alphabet's report on Jan. 26.\n\nWhy? Because empirically, trying to time a specific post-earnings outcome for any given stock has at best a 50% chance of success.\n\nWhile parts of the broader stock market showed some signs of volatility in recent days, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 - as represented by the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1(ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQ ) - continues to motor higher. Both GOOGL stock and GOOG stock, being an important part of this index often times can flash important signals as to the next directional move in the Nasdaq-100.\n\nGOOGL Stock Charts\n\nLooking at the big-picture multiyear weekly chart of Alphabet, we see that the uptrend (purple-dotted parallels) remains well intact. However, GOOGL is now bumping up against the very upper end of this range.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nAnother way of looking at this trading channel is to note that previous attempts at overshooting to the upside failed. As such, traders and investors primarily want to respect the trend.\n\nThe weekly chart provides some perspective as to the possibility of another explosive move higher from here. In fairness, that likelihood is fairly low in this time frame - at least without some sort of sideways consolidation, if not an outright corrective move lower to the middle or lower end of said channel.\n\nOn the daily chart, we see that GOOGL stock last November and December found support at its 200-day simple moving average (red). This was followed by a rally that pushed the stock back above its 50-day MA (yellow), which acted as support in early January and early February.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nThe sharp rebound following a multiday selloff on the back of the January earnings report is impressive. By last week, it had GOOGL stock bumping right back at the pre-earnings levels around $860.\n\nAlthough the stock has taken a little breather in recent days, on Monday, shares closed well off their intraday lows. Follow-through buying commenced on Tuesday.\n\nActive investors and traders can now use Monday's lows around $840 as a stop-loss to play the stock higher for a trade to new highs with a first upside price target around $870-$880.\n\nMore conservative traders may want to first wait for GOOGL stock to close back above the $855 area before legging into this trade.\n\nLike what you see?

The dollar gathered strength, while gold - which tends to lose value in a rising rates environment - was lower. \"Equities are at the crossroads of optimism and concern and are likely to go sideways until we get greater clarity from the Fed and legislative action,\" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. Investors are also digesting a strong post-election rally that has driven the main indexes to record highs, sparking some concern over market valuations. \"I think to a degree, equities are priced to perfection and there are several indicators that point to caution,\" Sandven said. The S&P 500 is trading at about 18 times forward earnings estimates against the long-term average of about 15 times, according to Thomson Reuters data. At 10:58 a.m. ET (1558 GMT), the Dow <.DJI> was down 6.88 points, or 0.03 percent, at 20,917.88 and the S&P 500 <.SPX> was up 2.5 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,370.89. The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> was up 22.15 points, or 0.38 percent, at 5,856.08, boosted by gains in Microsoft <MSFT.O> and Alphabet <GOOG.O>. Caterpillar <CAT.N> kept the Dow in the red, declining 1.2 percent after the New York Times said it reviewed a report commissioned by the U.S. government that accused the heavy equipment maker of carrying out tax and accounting fraud. Exxon <XOM.N> and Chevron <CVX.N> were the top drags on the S&P as oil prices slipped 1.4 percent. [O/R] Urban Outfitters <URBN.O> was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P, with a 4.8 percent decline following a sales miss that prompted William Blair to downgrade the stock and other brokerages to cut price targets. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,651 to 1,166. On the Nasdaq, 1,433 issues rose and 1,178 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 12 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 46 new highs and 27 new lows.

And when it comes to monetization, being a subsidiary of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) gives the service a serious advantage.\n\nA full transcript follows the video.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Netflix\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.*\n\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Netflix wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\n\nClick here to learn about these picks!\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017\n\n\n\nThis video was recorded on March 1, 2016.\n\nMac Greer: On Tuesday, YouTube introduced YouTube TV. For $35 a month, you get around 40 streaming channels. That includes the major networks -- ESPN, Fox News, MSNBC. David, YouTube is also partnered with local TV stations, so you could get local sports and news. Now, what you do not get is CNN, HBO, AMC, A&E, Comedy Central. So, there are some channels missing there. A lot of competition in this space. I guess the phrase that pays is \"skinny bundle.\" There are a lot of skinny bundles with Sling and the like. What do you make of YouTube?\n\nDavid Kretzmann: I think the two advantages that YouTube has here, potentially, and they say that they are negotiating with other content partners, so hopefully they can get some of those other partners on board onto this package, but, the two things that stick out to me that YouTube can do probably better than anyone else, especially with the current players, they're offering unlimited cloud-based DVR storage. Essentially, you'll be able to record up to nine months of content on YouTube. So, they're leveraging the dominant Google Cloud infrastructure in business that Alphabethas built up over the years. That's something you can't do with Sling TV. With Sling TV, you can only watch it live. You can't record something, you can't set up to record something ahead of time. You either watch it live or you miss it. I think that unlimited cloud-based DVR aspect, that's a really user-friendly aspect that tears into the traditional linear TV model. I think it makes the skinny bundle model, or that online streaming model, much more appealing and attractive for users. The other thing that sticks out to me that YouTube could probably do really well down the road is advertising. You could essentially, what Google could offer advertisers is say, \"We know this individual, they search for these products, they have these Search terms on Google, they have these viewing habits on YouTube.\" I think Google could arguably do a better job than anyone else of really personalizing and targeting individual ads to users. So, your live TV ads would be different from Matt's, so to speak. I don't know if that's necessarily the plan right now right off the bat, but I think down the road, that is something that could really play to YouTube's advantage.\n\nMatt Argersinger: It's fascinating to watch the evolution of the TV digital streaming market, whatever you want to call it. But in a way, I almost feel like we're coming full circle. If you think about it, when I learned that YouTube was going to have ESPN, I thought, that's huge, that's very compelling. But then, I say, wait, I still want CNN, I like AMC, I still want HBO. So, I start to think to myself, wait, I'm probably going to need two or three skinny bundles. Plus HBO Now, plus Netflix . Then all of the sudden I'm paying over $100 a month anyway, and then it's like, why don't I just stick with my cable subscription?\n\nGreer: I need a keyboard to go with my iPad.\n\nArgersinger: It's interesting. I think, if you really ask a consumer what they want, they want the true à la carte service. Just give me the 15 channels I want plus HBO and plus Netflix. That's what I want. And I'll pay a fee for that. But the bundling continues, and that's something that cable companies have done successfully for decades now. So, it seems like we're coming full circle with the TV market.\n\nGreers: Guys, this really also seems like kind of a play for the future. Piper Jaffray had a recent report that said 26% of teens watch YouTube every day. As those teens get older, and as they make more and more purchasing decisions, maybe YouTube TV becomes their television.\n\nArgersinger: It's already a tremendous brand. If you think about, amazingly, if you think about the Mount Rushmore of online properties, YouTube is absolutely there right next to Google which acquired, brilliantly, YouTube some 10 years ago now. Amazing.\n\nKretzmann: Yeah, and the Wall Street Journal just reported that the amount of content viewed on YouTube each day is now a billion hours a day. That's up 10X since 2012. So, the level of engagement that is on YouTube already is staggering. I think this TV offering, I think this is one of the more attractive TV offerings, aside from those properties that aren't included in this initial bundle. But I think with that cloud storage, that makes it very appealing, especially to younger viewers who don't necessarily want to sit down and watch a live show from eight to nine at night. They want to watch it whenever they want. They don't want to watch commercials. So, with that cloud storage, you can watch it when you want, you can skip the commercials. From a user experience perspective, I just think that's far and away above live TV, whether it's through a traditional cable package or online streaming. People just want to watch things on their own terms. I think this skinny bundle offering with YouTube is moving closer to that direction. But like Matt said, it's still not true à la carte. I think, ideally, people would pay $5 for CNN, $10 for ESPN, they'd be able to just pick --\n\nArgersinger: $20 for the NFL games that I want to watch this month.\n\nKretzmann: Right. And potentially just paying for a game. Maybe I'm not an NFL fan, but I'll pay to watch the Superbowl, or something like that. I think it'll be interesting to see if we move in that direction. I think from a user experience perspective, that's probably what most people would like. But whether or not the cable companies let that happen, they'll certainly be resistant to moving in that direction.\n\nGreer: How about, best thing you have watched recently, as we close?\n\nArgersinger: Let's see ... I watched this show called Travelers on Netflix. I don't know if you've seen it, it's one of those Netflix Original Series. Really well done. It's a slow starter, as a lot of these series are. But by the fourth or fifth episode, I was addicted, and I think my wife and I binged in like three nights. It was good stuff.\n\nKretzmann: I recently watched Sneaky Pete --\n\nGreer: Solid.\n\nKretzmann: -- which is one of the most recent Amazon Originals. Also, The People vs OJ Simpson , that was on Netflix, that was great. As someone who was born in 1992, I missed the OJ story, and now I get it, I get why people are obsessed with it. It's a great story.\n\nArgersinger: I can't believe that.\n\nKretzmann: I'm catching up on my history.\n\nArgersinger: I watched the white Bronco live with my dad.\n\nGreer: Speaking of catching up, I watched Dumb and Dumber for the first time with my kids.\n\nArgersinger: For the first time? Wow.\n\nGreer: Yes, I have never seen it. Father of the year. My eleven year old loved it. As did my eight year old.\n\nKretzmann: Quality entertainment.\n\nGreer: Yeah, it's high brow. On a slightly more serious note, there's a new HBO show called Crashing , which is really good. I'm two episodes in. The producer is Judd Apatow. It's very well done. Shout out to that.\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Mac Greer owns shares of Alphabet.

The EU has asked some complainants whether the information they submitted is nonconfidential and could be shared with Google. This is a sign the commission is preparing to show the company more evidence on which it plans to base its decision.\n\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\n\nhttp://www.rttnews.com\n\nThis article appears in: Politics , Stocks , Stocks", "In late February, Baidu 's(NASDAQ: BIDU) video streaming subsidiary iQiyi raised $1.53 billion in fresh funds to compete more effectively with rival sites. Hillhouse Capital, IDG Capital, Sequoia Capital, and Baidu all purchased the newly issued convertible bonds, and Baidu disclosed that it had invested $300 million.\n\niQiyi is the largest video streaming site in China, but it currently faces tough competition from Tencent (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) Video and Alibaba 's Youku Tudou. iQiyi has been losing money since Baidu purchased a majority stake in 2012, which has repeatedly sparked calls for Baidu to sell or spin-off the company to boost its profitability.\n\nThe iQiyi app for Android tablets. Image source: Google Play.\n\nLast December, the Wall Street Journal reported that Baidu was planning to spin off iQiyi in an IPO which could raise $1 billion. Baidu denied those rumors, and CEO Robin Li reiterated after the recent bond offering that the site was \"a great asset and an important part of the Baidu ecosystem.\" Let's take a closer look at iQiyi, and why Baidu prefers to raise capital through convertible bonds rather than spin off the company in an IPO.\n\nA brief look at iQiyi's history\n\nBaidu and American private equity firm Providence Equity Partners co-founded iQiyi in 2010. In 2012, Baidu bought out Providence's stake to become the dominant investor. It acquired the popular online video business of PPStream the following year, and launched its own film production division in 2014. That same year, smartphone giant Xiaomi and Shunwei Capital acquired a 10%-15% stake in iQiyi for $300 million.\n\nIn 2015, it acquired the online rights to top entertainment shows in China, Taiwan, and South Korea -- including the popular Korean variety show Running Man . In 2016, iQiyi launched in Taiwan, marking its first step outside of mainland China.\n\nDuring last quarter's conference call , Robin Li stated that iQiyi \"performed very well,\" with \"revenue and subscriber numbers ramping up nicely.\" According to iResearch's Dec. 2016 numbers, iQiyi's mobile app remained the top video streaming app in China, with 125 million daily active users and 480 million monthly active users, and streamed 335 billion minutes of monthly content.\n\niQiyi generates most of its revenue from ads, but it launched a paid service in 2015 that lets subscribers get earlier or exclusive access to blockbuster shows. iQiyi claimed the service reached 20 million subscribers last June, up from 5 million at the end of May 2015.\n\nBut profitability is tough\n\nOn the conference call, Robin Li stated that Baidu planned to support iQiyi's \"further growth,\" but noted that higher content acquisition costs at the site caused its total content costs to rise from 5.6% of revenues in 2015 to 11% in 2016. That statement raises some concerns when we look at Baidu's operating margins over the past five years.\n\nSource: YCharts\n\nRobin Li still hasn't provided a timeline for iQiyi's bottom line to break even, but CFO Jennifer Li noted that margins were \"improving\", and that they would continue doing so in the future. She also stated that to keep costs under control, Baidu will invest more heavily in original content to \"further strengthen and expand\" its subscription user base.\n\nYouTube faces the same challenges\n\nMaking a profit from streaming video is very tough. The platform might generate revenue with ads and subscriptions, but those gains often can't offset the costs of hosting videos on servers and content acquisition costs.\n\nEven Alphabet' s(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube, the biggest streaming video platform in the world with over a billion users, remains unprofitable due to those pressures. Last October, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki stated that the 12-year-old site was \"still in investment mode,\" and that there was \"no timetable\" for achieving profitability. Like iQiyi, YouTube offers a premium subscription platform, YouTube Red, but the service reportedly only had 1.5 million subscribers at the end of last summer.\n\nBaidu and Alphabet are willing to take losses on iQiyi and YouTube for a simple reason: streaming videos tether more users to their ecosystems. If those viewers use iQiyi they're more likely to use other services -- like Baidu Maps, Search, and Wallet -- instead of services from rivals like Tencent . Both companies can also track watched videos, which gives them more data for targeted ads.\n\nThe key takeaway\n\niQiyi will probably keep losing money for years, but investors shouldn't fret over those losses. The platform brings more users into Baidu's ecosystem, which widens its moat against other companies and ensures that it remains the top internet advertising platform in China. Therefore, investors shouldn't expect Baidu to spin off iQiyi any more than they expect Alphabet to spin off YouTube.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Baidu\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Among the most noteworthy WikiLeaks claims are that the Central Intelligence Agency, in partnership with other U.S. and foreign agencies, has been able to bypass the encryption on popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal, by hacking phones that use Google Inc's <GOOG.O> Android platform to collect audio and message traffic before encryption is applied. Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents, but several contractors and private cyber security experts said the materials, dated between 2013 and 2016, appeared to be legitimate. The information in what WikiLeaks said were 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments appears to represent the latest in a string of breaches in recent years of classified material from U.S. intelligence agencies. Experts differed over how much the disclosures will damage U.S. cyber espionage. Many said that, while harmful, they do not compare to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013 of intrusive NSA surveillance. Stuart McClure, CEO of Cylance, an Irvine, California, cyber security firm, said that one of the most significant disclosures shows how CIA hackers cover their tracks by leaving trails suggesting they are from Russia, China and Iran rather than the United States. Other revelations show how the CIA took advantage of vulnerabilities that are known, if not widely publicized. In one case, the documents say, U.S. and British personnel, under a program known as Weeping Angel, developed ways to take over a Samsung smart television, making it appear it was off when in fact it was recording conversations in the room. \"You thought your technology was safe. It's never been safe,\" said James Lewis, cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. The CIA and White House declined comment. \"We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents,\" CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said in a statement. Google declined to comment on the reported hacking of its Android platform, but said it was investigating the matter. Snowden on Twitter said the files amount to the first public evidence that the U.S. government secretly buys software to exploit technology, referring to a table published by WikiLeaks that appeared to list various Apple iOS flaws purchased by the CIA and other intelligence agencies. An Apple Inc <AAPL.O> spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. The documents refer to means for accessing phones directly in order to catch messages before they are protected by end-to-end encryption tools like Signal. Signal inventor Moxie Marlinspike said he took that as \"confirmation that what we're doing is working.\" Signal and the like are \"pushing intelligence agencies from a world of undetectable mass surveillance to a world where they have to use expensive, high-risk, extremely targeted attacks.\" CIA CYBER PROGRAMS The CIA in recent years underwent a restructuring to focus more on cyber warfare to keep pace with the increasing digital sophistication of foreign adversaries. The spy agency is prohibited by law from collecting intelligence that details domestic activities of Americans and is generally restricted in how it may gather any U.S. data for counterintelligence purposes. The documents published Tuesday appeared to supply specific details to what has been long-known in the abstract: U.S. intelligence agencies, like their allies and adversaries, are constantly working to discover and exploit flaws in any manner of technology products. Unlike the Snowden leaks, which revealed the NSA was secretly collecting details of telephone calls by ordinary Americans, the new WikiLeaks material did not appear to contain material that would fundamentally change what is publicly known about cyber espionage. WikiLeaks, led by Julian Assange, said its publication of the documents on the hacking tools was the first in a series of releases drawing from a data set that includes several hundred million lines of code and includes the CIA's \"entire hacking capacity.\" The documents do not include actual computer code needed to conduct the cyber exploits they describe. WikiLeaks said it published the CIA documents \"while avoiding the distribution of 'armed' cyber weapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such 'weapons' should be analyzed, disarmed and published.\" U.S. intelligence agencies have said that Wikileaks has ties to Russia's security services. During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Wikileaks published internal emails of top Democratic Party officials, which the agencies said were hacked by Moscow as part of a coordinated influence campaign to help Donald Trump win the presidency. WikiLeaks has denied ties to Russian spy agencies. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they did not know where WikiLeaks might have obtained the material. In a press release, the group said, \"The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.\" U.S. intelligence agencies have suffered a series of major security breaches, including Snowden's. In 2010, U.S. military intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning provided more than 700,000 documents, videos, diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to Wikileaks. President Barack Obama shortened her prison sentence in January. [nL1N1F7202] Last month, former NSA contractor Harold Thomas Martin was indicted on charges of taking highly sensitive government materials over a course of 20 years, storing the trove of secrets in his home. [nL1N1FT1WA] A longtime intelligence contractor with expertise in U.S. hacking tools said that people in the CIA and the NSA were \"furious\" about the apparent new breach. \"This is not a Snowden-type situation,\" he said. \"This was taken over a long term and handed over to WikiLeaks.\" (Reporting by Dustin Volz and Warren Strobel; additional reporting by Joe Menn, Mark Hosenball, Jonathan Landay and Jim Finkle; Editing by Bill Trott and Grant McCool) ((Dustin.Volz@thomsonreuters.com; 202-898-8415;)) Keywords: CIA WIKILEAKS/ (UPDATE 2, PIX)\n\nThis article appears in: Politics , Stocks , Stocks", "If you want your marketing message to reach a broad audience, there used to be no better option than national television commercials. But the growth of digital platforms like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google make it easy to reach hundreds of millions of people. What's more, you can target your message so it only reaches the most qualified potential buyers.\n\nThat's why digital has been eating into television ad budgets -- and why analysts expect that trend to continue for the foreseeable future. eMarketer forecasts that digital advertising spend in the U.S. will climb to $113 billion by 2020, while TV ad spend grows much more slowly, reaching just $77 billion. Digital spend just surpassed television last year.\n\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries of the shift of ad budgets from television to digital is Facebook.\n\nImage source: Facebook.\n\nA Super Bowl every day\n\nFacebook COO Sheryl Sandberg once likened Facebook's reach to the largest television event. \"We have a Super Bowl on mobile every day,\" she said.\n\nAnd it's true. Facebook has 1.23 billion daily active users -- 1.14 billion on mobile and 180 million in the U.S. and Canada. The Super Bowl earlier this year attracted 111.3 million viewers in the U.S.\n\nGranted the Super Bowl lasts something like five hours (more if Tom Brady sends it into overtime). The average Facebook user spends \"just\" 50 minutes per day across Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger, the last of which doesn't yet show ads.\n\nHowever, the average American watches less television today than they did a few years ago. View time across all age groups fell 11% in the six years ending last fall. The trend is more pronounced among younger people. People between 18 and 24 spent 35% less time watching traditional television during the second quarter last year compared to the second quarter of 2010, according to Nielsen.\n\nWhile Facebook isn't the only reason people are watching less TV, it presents a very good option for advertisers looking to replace that lost watch time.\n\nFacebook is taking a huge share of digital advertising growth\n\nDigital advertising is growing rapidly, but that doesn't mean all of that ad spend will go to Facebook. Nonetheless, Facebook has done an excellent job winning those new ad dollars flowing from television ad budgets to digital.\n\nIn the third quarter last year, Facebook took 45% of all digital advertising growth. Google managed to take 54% of advertising growth, leaving just 1% of growth for everyone else.\n\nFacebook is poised to continue capturing a lion's share of digital ad spend growth in the future, too. Display advertising is the largest form of digital advertising today, and eMarketer expects that to remain the case in the future. Facebook holds a wide lead in display advertising, bringing in around $12 billion in the U.S. last year compared to less than $5 billion for Google.\n\nFacebook is also working to attract more video content to its platform, which fits nicely with the trend of shifting ad budgets. Facebook is reportedly funding new content productions for its platform in the hopes of seeding an entire ecosystem similar to YouTube. YouTube has proven extremely lucrative for Google, and Facebook wants in on the billions of digital video adverting revenue it generates every year.\n\nNot only are ad budgets shifting from television to digital, Facebook is one of the few companies that's been able to attract those ad dollars thanks to its audience size, engagement, and ad targeting capabilities. As the trend continues through the end of the decade, that makes Facebook an awesome buy.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Facebook\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Snap, like many in the industry, does not have its ad metrics audited by a third party, a step that could help woo media buyers and advertisers and in turn boost revenue for the Snapchat owner, which is aiming to raise more than $3 billion in its initial public offering on Thursday. [nL2N1GD21V] \"I think the biggest challenge with using them (Snap) is measurement,\" said Stacey Stewart, executive vice president at advertising agency Universal McCann. \"Shifting any significant amount of funds or dollars into Snapchat, until we can start to prove out the measurement, is always going to be a challenge.\" Snap declined to comment when asked if it had plans for an external audit. At the high end of its expected IPO price range, Snap will have a market value of more than $22 billion even though it lost more than $514 million last year on $404 million in revenue. Snap's business model depends on drastically increasing ad dollars per user. That number sits at $2.15 for North America, where more than half of its users are based, according to Snap's S-1 filing. Facebook's average revenue per user in the U.S. and Canada is $19.81, according to the company's most recent earnings report. Snap's popular mobile video ads start at $10,000 per month, while ads on the Discover feature, reserved for big publishers and brands, start at $50,000 per day. Snap also lets brands buy a 24-hour sponsored lens or geofilters that can cost more than $700,000 for holidays and special events, according to digital marketing firm Wallaroo Media. Snap Ads will account for 68 percent of Snapchat's expected $804 million U.S. ad revenue in 2017, eMarketer estimates. While major advertisers have been eager to experiment with Snap, the measurement issues loom large in persuading advertisers to make big, long-term commitments. The digital ad industry has struggled for years with how to measure whether an ad has actually been seen, and what counts as a \"view\" when many users linger on a video for only a few seconds. Facebook Inc <FB.O> last year admitted to several errors in the way that it counts its advertising audience. In February, the company agreed to an independent audit by the Media Ratings Council, a step long advocated by groups including the Association of National Advertisers. Alphabet's Google <GOOG.O>, the market leader in online video advertising, also agreed last month to have more of its metrics audited by the MRC, including those for YouTube for the first time. NEW METRICS Snap has been introducing its own metrics that highlight engagement, arguing that its users, mostly in the 18-34-year-old demographic coveted by advertisers, spend an average of 25 to 30 minutes on the app and visit it more than 18 times a day. Snap Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan told potential investors in New York last week that they should focus less on user growth, a typical way of reading the potential of a social network, and more on how active users are on its app. In November, the company began using a newly launched metric by digital analytics firm Moat, called Moat Video Score, which assigns video ads a number between zero and 100 that rates the ad's performance based on how long it is viewed, how long the sound was on and how much space on the screen the ad occupied. Snap stated in its S-1 filing that \"there weren't any standard metrics\" in the industry. \"We see Snapchat as an opportunity, we think that most of our major advertisers are certainly leaning in somewhat to Snapchat,\" said Rob Norman, chief digital officer of ad agency GroupM, the world's largest media-buying firm. But he added that Snap had to show numbers to prove the effectiveness of its advertising. Google and Facebook control about 60 percent of the U.S. digital ad market and their growth has accelerated in recent years, according to data by eMarketer and Interactive Advertising Bureau. Advertisers, at a minimum, welcome that Snap will inject more competition into the market. \"You need that competition to put the onus back on the person selling you a bill of goods,\" said Ian Schafer, founder and chairman of digital ad agency Deep Focus. In January, an ex-Snap employee filed a lawsuit accusing the company of sharing inflated metrics with some investors ahead of its IPO. Snap dismissed the allegations as \"false from top to bottom\" and asked Los Angeles County Superior Court to put the case on hold until a private arbitration proceeding is completed. A hearing on the motion is scheduled for April 17. (Reporting by Angela Moon and Tim Baysinger; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Meredith Mazzilli) ((angela.moon@thomsonreuters.com; +1 646 223 5685; Reuters Messaging: angela.moon.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: SNAP IPO/ADVERTISING", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis Thursday, the Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP ) IPO is expected to hit the markets. The current price range on the deal is $14 to $16, which means that the company could raise over $3 billion. It seems like a good bet there will be a nice move on the upside, but you will probably not get any shares at offering price.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRather, you'll have to take your chances in the aftermarket, which can be dicey. So how should you approach SNAP? Ultimately, it depends on your time frame.\n\nLet's take a look at some potential strategies:\n\nSnapchat IPO: The Long-Term Trade\n\nA lot of investors are wondering: Will this be similar to the opening of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) or Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR )?\n\nAfter all, the performances are a stark contrast. FB has logged a gain of 254% since its debut while TWTR has lost a grueling 62%.\n\nUnfortunately, for the Snapchat IPO, I think there is a better chance that the returns will look more like the latter. Why? Snap Inc looks more like a niche operator. The 18-to-34 year-old category is certainly a valuable niche, as many advertisers have a tough time reaching this demographic, but the market opportunity may prove to be relatively small.\n\nAccording to Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser, the revenues from youth-oriented cable channels like MTV, VH1, Comedy Central and Adult Swim come to roughly $3 billion per year .\n\nBesides, if SNAP is unable to break out of its niche, the company will certainly be challenged in keeping up the growth of its user base. Actually, there has already been a deceleration. It went from 21 million net adds in Q2 of last year to only 5 million by Q4 .\n\nBut there are some other issues that could be a problem for long-term holders of Snapchat stock:\n\nThe net losses remain significant, coming to $514.6 million in 2016. This compares to revenues of $404.5 million .\n\nThe competition continues to get tougher. To this end, FB's Instagram has been essentially matching many of SNAP's core features (and this may help explain the deceleration in the user growth). According to InvestorPlace contributor Chris Lau : \"When FB launched Facebook Stories above the news feed, it took away a reason for millennials to leave the site and use SNAP. Similarly, Instagram Stories usage grew to 150 million daily active users in just five months.\"\n\nThere are signs that Spectacles, which are glasses that allow you to take photos and videos, may be losing much of their appeal. According to the Wall Street Journal , SNAP recently closed a pop-up store in New York City where \"there were often more employees than shoppers.\"\n\nSNAP has a contingent liability of $2 billion . This is what the company must pay - until 2022 - to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) for cloud services.\n\n(NASDAQ: , NASDAQ: ) for cloud services. Public shareholders will not have the right to vote. This will mean it will be nearly impossible for an activist investor to get any traction if there are problems with SNAP.\n\nThere is no headquarters, which could make it tough for allowing collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapchat IPO: The Short-Term Play\n\nWhile the risk factors mentioned above are downright scary, they probably won't amount to much during the next few months. If anything, the Snapchat IPO is likely to be a great vehicle for traders.\n\nOne key reason for this is technical: The amount of shares on the market will be fairly small. This means it will not take much buying power to move Snapchat stock.\n\nInterestingly enough, it looks like the company has been taking steps to keep the float tight. To this end, SNAP is requiring some investors to not sell 50 million of the 200 million shares that will be offered.\n\nOf course, there will be some other factors that will help drive the momentum. Keep in mind that SNAP likely has various deals lined up, which should gin up buzz over time. It also helps that there has been a dearth of IPO activity over the last year. Oh, and of course, the overall equities markets have been in a powerful bull mode, which is always critical for IPOs.\n\nOverall, things are lining up quite nicely for the Snapchat IPO, yet this is probably not a stock to hold on for too long.\n\nTom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbook and is the author of various books, including Taxes 2017: Saving A Bundle.

Initial valuation estimates in the $20-25bn range were quickly followed by a few bolder claims that the IPO may fetch the company a valuation as high as $40bn . With this in mind, immediate post-announcement commentary was decisively bearish, and largely centered around the company's disproportionately high price compared to revenues of only $405m in 2016.\n\nAs time has gone by, more thoughtful analyses have shifted attention over to Snap's growth prospects, and here significant concerns have emerged over the company's slowing user growth , drawing comparisons to Twitter's ( TWTR ) lackluster post-IPO performance , and thus placing serious questions on the purported valuation figures. As a result, Snap has reportedly lowered its expectations , and certain estimates expect pricing to come as low as $14-$16 per share, implying a valuation of $16-19bn .\n\nAhead of its expected pricing (anticipated on March 1st ) we take a look at whether the rumored valuation makes sense, and provide our own guidance on where investors should be pricing the stock.\n\nWe find that while overall market concerns regarding DAU growth are justified, the market is likely undervaluing the company's ARPU growth prospects and conclude that there is significant upside on the table for investors. For us, Snap is a buy.\n\nAs mentioned, initial reports largely focused on comparing Snap's purported valuation to its revenues, which when compared to its peers, admittedly looks very expensive (table 1).\n\nBut such an analysis misses the mark completely in two important ways. Firstly, many of the companies in Snap's peer universe are not directly comparable (Google ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) is a search company and Amazon ( AMZN ) is an online retailer, to name a few). Limiting the peer universe to Snap's most directly comparable peers, Facebook ( FB ) and Twitter, is a more appropriate juxtaposition (charts 1 and 2).\n\nBut even when just limiting one's comparison to Facebook and Twitter, the maturity profiles of the respective companies are very different and must be accounted for. A fairer analysis would look at the metrics pre-IPO for all three (charts 3 and 4). In doing so, readers will notice that the relative valuation, albeit still expensive, looks less so than in the prior charts.\n\nThere are still timing issues with such a comparison though. For reference, Facebook was eight years old and Twitter was seven at the time of their IPOs. Snap is only five, and with 2-3 more years of growth under its belt, Snap could be a very different company.\n\nMoreover, Snap is a direct-to-mobile platform while Facebook and Twitter went public in a world in which desktop-delivery still played a dominant role. Considering the shift from desktop to mobile, Snap is entering a market with a growing user base (mobile taking share from desktop) on a delivery platform that is capturing increasing user engagement (charts 5 and 6).\n\nIn summary, the different maturity profiles coupled with the different delivery platforms, both now as well as at IPO, make for a troublesome comparables-based approach when assessing Snap's valuation. Snap may look expensive when compared to its peers, but comparing to its peers is not the right approach.\n\nWith the above in mind, a Snap-only analysis makes most sense. And such an analysis should almost solely be focused on one thing: growth. For any company at Snap's stage, growth is paramount to valuation, and to this end, there are fundamentally two things that affect growth going forward:\n\n1) Growth in Daily Active Users (DAUs), and\n\n2) Growth in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)\n\nWe look at these in turn.\n\nMuch of the more insightful analysis which emerged a few weeks after the filing has in fact focused on DAU growth. And the hawks are out in flock. Unfortunately for Snap,while initial user growth performance was impressive (chart 7), there has been a significant downtick in new users joining the platform in recent months. Despite outperforming both Facebook and Twitter in terms of user growth in the six quarters leading up to its IPO, Snap saw quarterly growth rates drop from double digit figures to only 7% in Q3 16 and, even more worryingly, to a paltry 3.3% in Q4 16 (chart 8).\n\nManagement's justification for the following can be found in their S1, where they state :\n\n\"The rate of net additional Daily Active Users was relatively flat in the early part of the quarter ended December 31, 2016, and accelerated in the month of December. Although we have historically experienced lumpiness in the growth of our Daily Active Users, we believe that the flat growth in the early part of the quarter was primarily related to accelerated growth in user engagement earlier in the year, diminished product performance, and increased competition. The rate of net additional Daily Active Users accelerated in the first half of 2016 compared to the second half of 2015, largely due to increased user engagement from product launches and increased adoption rates among older demographics and international markets. This created a higher baseline of Daily Active Users heading into the third and fourth quarters, so incremental net additions within these quarters were more difficult even with strong year-over-year growth. Additionally, in mid-2016, we launched several products and released multiple updates, which introduced a number of technical issues that diminished the performance of our application. We believe these performance issues resulted in a reduction in the growth of our Daily Active Users, particularly among Android users and regions with a higher percentage of Android devices. Finally, we also saw increased competition both domestically and internationally in 2016, as many of our competitors launched products with similar functionality to ours.\"\n\nThe above explanation thus emphasizes two key potential causes for the slowdown in growth: technical issues with their Android product, and/or increasing competition.\n\nThe former,while problematic, would not be a significant cause for concern. One would think that a company funded to the tune of $2.6bn and with nearly 2,000 employees (many of them in engineering) would be able to solve this and revert the company's growth course back to what it was at the beginning of 2016.\n\nBut the more worrying concern revolves around competition. Snap faces increasing pressure from competitors, particularly Facebook and Instagram, which, if unresolved, could continue to limit DAU growth going forward. In fact, it is no wonder that Snapchat's growth numbers began suffering in Q3 16 as this was exactly when Instagram launched Stories , a near-blatant copy of Snapchat's namesake.\n\nUnfortunately for Snap, data regarding growth in DAU by geography only lends further weight to the competition concerns. In fact, on a geographical basis, much of the slowdown in Snap's DAUs appears to have been primarily in the \"Rest of World\" region (chart 9). Given Instagram's significantly larger user base abroad ( 80% of Instagram's c.300m DAUs are international ), one could see how the incentives for installing Snapchat diminishes as Instagram (and other competitors) begin to offer the key features that Snapchat has to-date sold itself on.\n\nTo summarize, things don't look good for Snapchat from a DAU growth perspective. Not only was Q4 16 Snap's lowest growing quarter since the beginning of its publicly available data, but it was even slower than that of Facebook, a far more mature company (chart 10). Given these headwinds, Snap will have to effectively convince investors that it can address its decelerating quarter-over-quarter DAU growth if it wishes to hit the valuation numbers that have been publicized.\n\nLooking Ahead: Facebook Growth or Twitter Struggles?\n\nWith the above in mind, our expectation is that Snap, going forward, will experience a user growth profile more akin to Twitter's than to Facebook's.While growth will be sustained by its continued popularity in the United States, competition from Facebook, Instagram and other international competitors will continue to limit Snap's growth internationally.\n\nOur base case expectation is therefore for an average of 14.1% growth per year post-IPO, almost right in between Facebook's and Twitter's annual average growth rates of 19.1% and 10.3%, respectively (table 2). The primary source of the growth premium to Twitter derives from Snapchat's ability to innovate on product features better than Twitter (more on this below).\n\nARPU Growth: Solid Start with Ample Upside Remaining\n\nWhilst the above DAU estimates are nothing for investors to get excited about, and fall largely in line with most market commentary, stopping one's analysis at DAU performance is shortsighted. In particular, it misses the key other side of the coin: ARPU. And when it comes to ARPU growth, we see a radically different story. Our view is that Snapchat will see strong ARPU growth going forward, driven by the following factors:\n\nA more monetization-friendly product\n\nA more advantageous position with a key user demographic\n\nA generally more monetization-focused management mindset\n\nAll of these will in turn be boosted by general underlying strength in the mobile advertising space. We look at these in turn.\n\nOne of the most attractive features of Snapchat from an ARPU standpoint is that the product itself appears to lend itself very well, arguably better than its competitors, to monetization. The effectiveness of the platform is largely driven by Snap's ability to innovate on product features and stay ahead of the competition, and this has allowed Snap to build impressively strong positions in image sharing and in video.\n\nLooking first at image sharing, Snap has caught up rapidly with its competitors (chart 11) largely thanks to its ability to innovate with the format (initially with disappearing messages, later with filters, Stories, etc.). The implication of this is significant in that it has allowed Snap to lead the industry in terms of developing and delivering sponsored / branded content for this type of format. For instance, focusing on sponsored filters, Snap's ability to reach a large audience far exceeds Facebook despite its significantly smaller user base (chart 12).\n\nThe growth in image sharing and the innovation surrounding its product features has positioned Snap favorably amongst advertisers, allowing Snap to strike important partnerships with very significant brands worldwide. One of the examples of such campaigns that Snap highlights in its S1 relates to how Wendy's blanketed its U.S. stores with Sponsored Geofilters that promoted the Jalapeño Fresco Chicken Sandwich. Snap's measurement tool reported that the Sponsored Geofilter drove over 42,000 incremental people to a Wendy's location within seven days of viewing the Sponsored Geofilter.\n\nPerhaps more important than image sharing, Snap has developed a dominant position in video, converting it into a serious threat to Facebook . According to the KCPB presentation , as of Q1 16 Snap has surpassed Facebook in terms of daily video views despite its significantly smaller user base (chart 13).\n\nThis success to date has been driven by Snap's unique approach to the video format. KCPB refers to Snaps approach as \" 3V Advertising \": (1) Vertical - made for mobile viewing, (2) Video - a great way to tell a story, (3) Viewing - always full screen.\n\nThe combination of these three has made video advertising that much more effective on Snapchat. In fact, according to the KCPB presentation, outside of Snapchat many video ads are ineffective with 81% of people muting the ads. However, Snap points out in its S-1 that on average, 60% of all Snap Ads are watched with the sound on.\n\nThe above again points to Snap's effectiveness as a monetization platform as well as the management team's ability to keep innovating on product and stay ahead of the curve when it comes to marrying fun and engaging product features with monetization avenues. A recent example of success with video would beGatorade's sponsored lens during the Super Bowl, a campaign which led to 60 million plays in total, 165 million views and an increase of 8 points in purchase intent.\n\nSnap has developed the ultimate trifecta - a robust advertising platform that combines communications (chatting), image creation and sharing, and video content. This has lead to numerous marketing campaigns achieving above average industry impact, performance and ROI. This should support rapid growth of ARPU as more marketers recognize these benefits and decide to move advertising dollars over to Snap.\n\nAs the pool of mobile advertising investment dollars rises, more advertisers are looking to target Millennials and younger demographics. In 2015, Marketers dedicated over a third (34%) of their annual marketing budgets to targeting these groups. That figure was likely even greater with teens and \" tweens \" included.\n\nThe above phenomenon is largely because Millennials are expected to drive consumer spending in the years to come. Millennials are 80 million strong , the largest demographic in the United States, and as of March 2015, also the largest demographic in the workforce .\n\nThis of course translates into huge spending power. Estimates indicate Millennials could be spending $1.4 trillion annually by 2020 and could inherit as much as $30 billion in the coming years. Even teens and tweens are generating significant spending power, spending as much as Baby Boomers in 2015.\n\nThe issue advertisers face is that Millennials are moving away from traditional advertising channels to their phones (chart 14). Companies like Snap, as well as its competitors, provide an optimal channel through which to target these groups.\n\nFortunately for Snap, they seem to have developed a very strong position in these age-groups. With 63% of Snap users in the 18-34 age category, and 22% between 13-17 years of age, Snap has captured the attention of a highly coveted marketing demographic (chart 15 - note: chart is from a 2016 comScore report, as such the data does not perfectly tie with Snap's latest demographics reported in its S-1).\n\nMore importantly, Snap has become a leading platform in terms of its engagement within 18-34 age demographic (chart 16). Facebook is clearly a dominant player with massive reach and significant engagement, but Snapchat is the second leading platform in terms of average monthly minutes per visitor. As Snap continues to expand its reach and further penetrate this key age group, Snap should move higher and further to the right on this chart as it continues to threaten Facebook's leadership.\n\nThis all bodes very well for Snap. The company has continued to rapidly expand its reach within the 18-24 category while also broadening its penetration within older age groups. As of December 2015, according to comScore, more than three-out-of-five 18-24 year olds now actively use Snapchat, with older age groups also on the rise (chart 17).\n\nWith a dominance in the Millennial, Teen and Tween demographics, the second leading platform in terms of monthly engagement and further expansion of its reach within each of those key demographics Snap should receive an outsized portion of advertising dollars going forward. This should support rapid ARPU expansion in the coming years.\n\nPutting the above two tactical points aside, the most encouraging thing about Snap is that management has consistently shown a greater predisposition and knack for converting fun new product features into monetization avenues. In short: Snap management appears to be excellent at monetization.\n\nAnd the results bear this out. When comparing to Facebook and Twitter, Snap started monetizing earlier, and has grown faster in terms of ARPU than both of its comparables, despite being several years \"younger\" as a company (charts 18 and 19).\n\nAdmittedly, claiming that Snap is simply better at monetizing than its comps is a subjective and difficult-to-prove assertion. However, if you believe this, then what makes this an even more interesting point is when you consider how much upside could still be left for Snap to capture. To this end, a simple side-by-side comparison of ARPU numbers with Facebook and Twitter suggests that Snap's ARPU could rise as much as 7x what it is today (chart 20).\n\nFor us, Snap's impressive historical performance in ARPU driven by its clear ability to innovate in product and monetization, combined with the tremendous upside still there for the taking, points to strong and rapid catch-up in terms of ARPU in the years to come. It is therefore not surprising to us that after having failed to acquire Snapchat, Facebook has now reverted to replicating its features consistently .\n\nAside from the intrinsic strengths of Snap as a company, it's also obvious that overall underlying industry strength will help sustain ARPU growth in the coming years (although the extent to which this will be remains a question).\n\nAccording to a report from IDC , ad spending is expected to grow from $652 billion in 2016 to $767 billion in 2020 with mobile specific spending growing 3x from $66 billion in 2016 to $196 billion in 2020. Social media marketing in particular is expected to grow 20% per year to $50.2bn in 2019, comfortably overtaking newspaper advertising by 2020.\n\nMoreover, according to KPCB , there is a $22bn market opportunity in mobile advertising as it is the only growing outlet in terms of percent of consumption time. This should continue to encourage marketers to shift away from more legacy outlets like TV and print and into mobile (chart 21). Given that Snap's entire advertising inventory is on mobile, a growing pool of total mobile advertising dollars will certainly benefit Snap going forward.\n\nFor further revenue upside one can't overlook Snap's potential to develop ancillary products.\n\nSnap has already demonstrated a willingness to explore new product categories with the launch of Spectacles in September 2016, its first ever hardware product. New product developments outside of software could potentially provide Snap with a very interesting monetization model that is different from their competitors (FB is exploring VR) and a unique way of owning more of the user's share of mind.\n\nSpectacles are wearable glasses with a built-in camera that links seamlessly to a smartphone to create unique Snaps from a \"human perspective.\" The company views Spectacles as an extension of Snapchat and intends to use the glasses to create a unique circular format for video as opposed to the standard rectangular viewing perspective (once again reinventing the standard video delivery model).\n\nSpectacles do generate revenue for Snap, but for 2016 the revenues were not material and, thus, not reported in the company's filing. Going forward, Spectacles could represent a much larger portion of Snap's revenue.\n\nIt's unclear what other types of new products Snap is planning to bring to market, but Snap has demonstrated a strong ability to create innovative and sticky products that drive incremental user growth and revenue (chart 22). Expect each new product introduction to be strategic in driving user growth, enhancing user engagement, and increasing share of mind, all things that should bring create even greater revenue opportunities for Snap.\n\nLooking ahead and given all of the above, our expectation is that despite slowing user growth, Snap's platform should support very strong ARPU growth going forward. We see Snap's ARPU catching up with Facebook's in the next five years, and it would not surprise us if it surpasses it further out. In other words, despite Twitter-like user growth, Snap is likely to experience more of a Facebook-like, if not better, ARPU growth profile.\n\nThe biggest risk to this scenario playing out mainly relates to Facebook and other competitors' ability to replicate Snap's features both quickly and effectively. Should this be the case, Snap's leadership in product innovation will likely fail to spill over into significant ARPU growth. However, should competitors struggle to play the \"catch-up game\" well enough, Snap will likely see ARPU growth rates in line with what we predict below. The latter has been interestingly described as the \"Gingerbread strategy\" in this article .\n\nWith that in mind we anticipate two possible ARPU growth trajectories. Our downside case projections are more in line with other commentaries and essentially consider the latter scenario of product innovation followed by effective catch-up by competitors. The base case is instead predicated on management's ability to keep innovating on product, and competitors' relative ineffectiveness at copying such features.\n\nThe numbers of both cases are displayed in table 3 below, but the highlight is that in our base case projections, we anticipate north of 50% CAGR over the next five years, with ARPU catching up to Facebook's 2016 numbers by 2019/2020.\n\nWith all of the above in mind, we can now proceed to calculating our estimated valuation for Snap. We first look at what Snap's revenues will look like going forward, based on our DAU and ARPU assumptions outlined above, and then move into a valuation analysis using these revenue estimates.\n\nFinancial Forecasts\n\nOur financial forecasts are summarized in Table 4, but the headline numbers we want to highlight are the following:\n\nDAU growth in between Twitter and Facebook's post-IPO performance, reaching 246 million DAUs by 2019\n\nStrong ARPU catch-up and growth, reaching $6.88 per user by 2019, nearly equaling Facebook's current 2016 ARPU numbers, in the Base Case\n\nMore limited ARPU growth in the Downside Case, reaching $4.80 by 2019, in line with Twitter's current ARPU numbers\n\nTotal Revenues of $1.6 billion and $3.8 billion achieved in 2017 and 2018, respectively, in the Base Case\n\nTotal Revenues of $1.3 billion and $2.7billion achieved in 2017 and 2018, respectively, in the Downside Case\n\nWe value Snap on an EV / Revenue basis using a target multiple range of 6.0x to 10.0x derived from the midpoint of the range between Facebook and Twitter current trading multiples. On the one hand, Snap's more limited DAU growth warrants a lower multiple than Facebook's, but on the other hand its more favourable ARPU prospects warrant a premium to Twitter's multiple. We apply these multiple to forward 2018 revenue estimates to account for Snap being a younger company than both of its comps. Our valuation estimates are summarised in Table 5 below, but the key takeaways are as follows:\n\nDespite limited DAU growth, our base case ARPU assumptions imply a valuation of c. $30bn based off a 8.0x multiple on 2018 forward revenue estimates\n\nIn our bearish case, we come out at $22bn on 2018 forward revenue estimates, in line but still slightly above more recent price targets.\n\nOverall, we see strong upside potential for Snap going forward, with the valuation potentially rising to nearly $50bn assuming greater maturity of their comps justifies using Snap's 2019 forward revenue estimates for the valuation, concluding that this stock is a buy.\n\nSnap: Twitter growth, but Facebook ARPU\n\nIn many respects, one could say that the Snap IPO heralds a more general shift in social media platforms from building for user growth to building for user engagement and monetization. Since inception, Snap has always felt more like a blend between a traditional social media app and a gaming app. The more playful nature of the platform has in turn translated positively into monetization and ARPU growth, far more so than Snap's peers did at their equivalent stages of their lifecycle. Whether a purposeful management strategy or not, Snap seems better built for monetization.\n\nThis of course is occurring concurrently with an increasing shift in advertising spend from traditional media outlets to online/digital and particular mobile channels. In many ways, it feels like advertisers are reaching the tipping point of shifting a majority of their dollars to social media and \"new media\" channels.\n\nAs a result, we view Snap's future financial prospects very favorably, and per our analysis above, conclude that Snap is a buy. Snap's value is a function of being the first social media platform that has been built with advertisers in mind from the beginning.\n\nThis opinion article is for informational purposes only, and does not constitute investment advice.

Other times, it blows up in their faces and hurts investors who took their advice. The latter recently happened to BTIG Research analyst Richard Greenfield, who boldly upgraded Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) from Neutral to Buy with a price target of $25 -- right before the social network's dismal fourth quarter earnings sank the stock .\n\nAll analysts and investors eventually make bad calls, but Greenfield's upgrade raised eyebrows, since it clearly went against the popular view that Twitter was stuck in a terminal decline. Let's take a look at why Greenfield believed that Twitter could make a comeback, and why those bullish ideas might be misguided.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy did BTIG believe in Twitter?\n\nGreenfield believed that several catalysts would help Twitter recover. First, he saw a \"meaningful uptick\" in downloads of the iOS app, which he attributed to the U.S. election and President Trump's widely covered use of the platform. Second, he noted that a recent CivicScience survey showed an increase in the app's daily active users (DAUs). Greenfield cited those two factors as evidence of higher user engagement.\n\nAs user growth and engagement rebound, Greenfield believes that advertisers and potential suitors could return. The analyst doesn't \"expect immediate financial benefits\" in the first half of the year, but believes that Twitter's \"second half 2017 revenues could exceed investors' expectations with 2018 well above consensus.\"\n\nWhy were those ideas misguided?\n\nGreenfield's claim that iOS downloads were rising is true. According to App Annie, Twitter's iOS rank in the U.S. surged from 33th to 8th place between Feb. 29, 2016 and Jan. 20, 2017. Unfortunately, that growth quickly reversed after Trump's inauguration, and the app slipped back to 26th place at the end of February.\n\nGreenfield's claim that DAUs are rising was also confirmed in Twitter's earnings report, which revealed that its DAUs rose 11% annually during the quarter -- an acceleration from 7% growth in the third quarter, 5% growth in the second quarter, and 3% growth in the first quarter. However, Twitter left out one crucial number -- the actual number of DAUs.\n\nThat figure matters because Twitter's monthly active users (MAUs) only rose 4% annually to 319 million during the quarter. If Twitter's DAU growth is outpacing its MAU growth, it means a small group of power users are tweeting more frequently, but the platform still isn't reeling in casual users. Twitter also hasn't made it easy for casual users to get started, since it still hasn't adequately addressed common complaints like its 140-character limit, non-threaded replies, and the proliferation of fake and spam accounts -- all of which make user-to-user interactions difficult.\n\nWhy advertisers and potential buyers aren't coming back\n\nSome of the company's decisions over the last few years have set it up for an uphill battle in winning back advertisers and potential acquirers.\n\nFirst, former CEO Dick Costolo pivoted Twitter toward a \"cost per engagement\" model which let advertisers pay for only the interactions (tweets, likes, retweets) that they wanted.\n\nAt the time, Costolo believed that move would help it reach smaller businesses with limited advertising budgets. Instead, the move backfired and allowed large customers to pay less money for fewer clicks. Twitter still hasn't recovered from that move -- that's probably why its core advertising revenues fell 0.5% annually last quarter.\n\nAs for a buyout, CEO Jack Dorsey and previous suitors seem to have abandoned the idea. In January, Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google agreed to buy most of Twitter's developer products for an undisclosed sum. That sale indicates that Twitter could sell off non-core businesses to generate fresh cash -- which might be attractive to companies like Google, which value Twitter's tech but don't want its stalled out user base, sluggish advertising business, and controversies regarding bullying, trolling, and illegal accounts. Dorsey's recent purchase of $7 million in shares also indicates that the co-founder believes in Twitter's long-term future -- which might mean that a buyout is off the table.\n\nBeating estimates in 2017 and 2018 might not matter\n\nLastly, Greenfield's suggestion that Twitter could beat expectations in 2017 and 2018 isn't as bullish as it sounds. Analysts expect Twitter's revenue to fall 6.4% this year and rebound 7.5% next year -- indicating that Twitter's 2018 revenue will remain nearly flat from 2016 levels. Beating those estimates won't put Twitter back on the track to higher growth.\n\nGreenfield might believe that time will eventually prove his thesis right. However, Twitter's slumping sales growth, the sluggish evolution of its platform, and a CEO that splits his time between two companies all indicate that things could get much worse before they get better.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Twitter\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

We spend countless hours on each site keeping up with friends and binge-watching our favorite shows.\n\nIn fact, with the addition of Alphabet and Amazon , I think we'd be hard-pressed to find more influential companies in today's society. That fact has not been lost on investors. Over the past four years, both stocks have quintupled in value.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBut which is a better buy today? That's a difficult question to answer, though we can get a better understanding for what we're buying by looking at the question through three different lenses.\n\nSustainable competitive advantages\n\nIf I had one word of advice for beginning investors, it would be this: Spend the bulk of your time investigating a company's sustainable competitive advantages. Often referred to as a \"moat\" by investors, sustainable competitive advantages are what keep customers coming back for more every year and consistently keep the competition at bay.\n\nNetflix benefits from, as I see it, three different types of moats. The first is the brand. The Qwikster fiasco not withstanding, the company has won over legions of loyal customers who appreciate the service and its original content. That original content is key, as it is gets people hooked into the Netflix ecosystem.\n\nManagement is able to target its original content because it has more data on our viewing habits than any other organization in the history of the world. That also gives the company the upper hand when it comes to paying for content from third-party providers. Imagine the negotiating table: Netflix knows just how popular certain shows are to its viewers and how valuable it is. The other side has no idea. That asymmetry provides pricing power.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nFinally, Netflix benefits from a sneaky type of moat I only recently came to appreciate. Once customers sign on, the cost of the monthly plan is so low -- and the payments fully automated -- that a user would have to be highly motivated to cancel his/her membership.\n\nFacebook, on the other hand, benefits from one of the most powerful moats in the world: the network effect. With each additional member who joins Facebook, non-members are incentivized to join as a way of keeping up with their friends and family. It's a virtuous cycle that is in full effect. Even though the company already has over 1 billion daily active users, its roster continues to grow -- up 18% year over year.\n\nNot only that but Facebook gets essentially all of its content for free. That's often underappreciated by investors. Imagine what a boon it would be if Netflix never had to pay for its shows.\n\nAt the end of the day, both of these companies have powerful moats. In years past, I would have given the nod to Facebook. But my realization of how easy it is for Netflix to keep subscribers -- and how effective original content is at bringing in new users -- is enough to call this a draw.\n\nWinner = Tie\n\nFinancial fortitude\n\nWhile conservative investors love seeing cash returned to them via dividends and more aggressive investors love seeing cash reinvested in a company's growth prospects, there's something to be said for cash.\n\nEvery company will experience difficult financial times, and the companies that enter those phases with lots of cash will prosper. They will have the flexibility to outspend rivals and gain market share, repurchase stock on the cheap, and even make strategic acquisitions. Debt-laden companies will be in the opposite boat, forced to satisfy the whims of their creditors.\n\nCompany Cash Debt Net Income Free Cash Flow Netflix $1.7 billion $3.4 billion $0.2 billion ($1.6 billion) Facebook $30 billion $0 $10.2 billion $11.6 billion\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Cash includes cash, short, and long-term investments.\n\nHere, we have a very clear winner. Netflix is spending lots of cash on its international expansion and original programing. That's a great strategy because, as mentioned above, once customers are locked in, they're a reliable source of recurring revenue.\n\nBut with that strategy comes financial fragility. Netflix is free cash flow negative, while Facebook is a cash machine with no long-term debt whatsoever.\n\nWinner = Facebook\n\nValuation\n\nFinally, we have valuation. While this isn't an exact science, there are some straightforward metrics we can consult to give us an idea of how expensive each stock is.\n\nCompany P/E P/FCF PEG Ratio Netflix 340 N/A 1.6 Facebook 32 34 1.1\n\nData source: SEC filings, E*Trade. P/E represents figures from non-GAAP earnings.\n\nHere again, we have a clear winner. Because of the aforementioned spending, Netflix is very expensive based on traditional metrics.\n\nFacebook, on the other hand, looks like a pretty good deal at today's prices. While a P/E of 32 would never be described as \"cheap,\" the company increased earnings by 86% last year, and is expected to grow by 28% moving forward.\n\nWinner = Facebook\n\nThe winner is...\n\nSo there you have it: While both companies have powerful moats, Facebook has a better balance sheet and appears to be a better value at today's prices. You really can't go wrong by investing in either, but I'm a much stronger fan of Facebook at today's levels. That helps explain why it accounts for 14% of my real-life holdings, while Netflix clocks in at just 2%.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Facebook\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Alphabet (A shares), Alphabet (C shares), Amazon, Facebook, and Netflix.

The Information reports that those requests couldn't be handled without human agents, and bots built by outside developers \"had issues\" because the \"technology to understand human requests wasn't developed enough.\"\n\nSo instead of building a large ecosystem of chatbots, Facebook will train Messenger bots to handle \"a narrower set of cases, so users aren't disappointed by the limitations of automation.\" Let's see what this strategic shift means for Facebook's AI efforts, and whether or not chatbots will ever become meaningful tools for the social network.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nUnderstanding Facebook's AI strategy\n\nArtificial intelligence plays a vital role in helping Facebook track users and deliver targeted ads. By using AI to scan a user's status updates, photos, videos, check-ins, likes, linked apps, and other data, Facebook generates digital profiles of users which help it deliver targeted ads to their News Feeds. In 2013, Facebook launched the FAIR (Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research) unit to continuously upgrade those AI capabilities.\n\nThat's where Messenger comes in. In 2014, Facebook forced users to download the stand-alone Messenger app to keep chatting. That move -- which clearly mirrored Tencent 's(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) WeChat -- laid the foundations for Messenger to become a \"platform\" which could eventually offer ride hailing, mobile payments, deliveries, games and other services from a single app.\n\nFacebook's Messenger app. Image source: Google Play.\n\nThat move would give Facebook an \"OS within an OS\" to counter the iOS App Store and Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Play. Facebook's next step would be to replace apps with Messenger chatbots, which were introduced last April. If that effort works, it could turn the entire mobile app store model upside down.\n\nThe premature rise of the chatbots\n\nIn theory, a business chatbot could answer questions, make purchase suggestions, process orders, and send shipping updates to customers. For customers, having \"conversations\" with these bots would feel more natural than scrolling and clicking through a mobile app. Companies could also cut costs by reducing the number of human customer service representatives.\n\nFacebook tethers those bots to Messenger for Business, which provides a live customer service chat channel for a large number of businesses. Businesses can choose to put a human or a chatbot to handle queries on their end. This idea attracted a lot of early adopters -- 30,000 Facebook bots were already active on Messenger as of last September.\n\nBut just as Google struggled with low-quality apps over the years, Facebook's ecosystem quickly became bogged down with poorly produced chatbots. Badly made bots could annoy customers and tarnish a company's image -- so the company decided it's a better idea to send the bots back to the drawing board than expand the overall ecosystem.\n\nFacebook should've seen this coming\n\nThe limitations of AI-powered bots were already clear when Facebook launched its chatbot APIs last year. For example, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) launched its chatbot Tay on Twitter as an experiment last March. Within 24 hours, Tay started tweeting racist and sexist comments, forcing Microsoft to abruptly pull the plug and issue an apology. Tencent has also struggled to purge spam and scam bots on WeChat since it started letting millions of accounts create their own bots.\n\nFacebook's AI tech also wasn't that impressive prior to the arrival of its chatbots. Its News Feed struggled to discern fake news headlines from real ones, and its Messenger-based virtual assistant M hasn't gained much ground against Google Now or Siri.\n\nEdison Investment analyst Richard Windsor -- who recently called Facebook a \"laggard in AI\" compared to Google -- stated that \"when Facebook tries to automate its systems, things always go wrong.\" He also pointed out that while Facebook has hired plenty of AI talent, it simply hasn't been working on AI \"for nearly long enough\" to challenge market leaders like Google.\n\nSo what's next for Facebook's AI efforts?\n\nDespite those missteps, Facebook probably won't stop investing in chatbots anytime soon. The company is expected to introduce new AI plans at its F8 conference in April, which will likely include ways to boost the quality, not quantity, of its Messenger bots. It could also introduce more ways to tether bots into other Messenger features -- like payments and games -- to increase the app's appeal as a stand-alone platform.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Facebook\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Buyers should step in on down weeks and defend the stock for me.\n\nI could sell credit call spreads in the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQ ) to create some balance, but I don't feel it's necessary at this time.\n\nEarlier, I noted that I like selling naked puts in sure things like AAPL and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). So I will offer the trade, but I only do this if I am willing and able to own the stock at the strike sold.\n\nThe Alternate: Sell the AAPL Oct $105 put naked. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.25 per contract to open. My breakeven point is $103.75 per share. Anything lower would accrue losses for me.\n\nIf AAPL stock falls below my sold strike, I would be put the stock at that price even if it's much lower. Therein lies the open-ended risk unlike that of a credit put spread.\n\nI am not required to hold trades through expiration. I can close either of them for partial gains or losses at any time.\n\nNicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com .

Go Long Buffett! appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLess than five years after the U.S. Justice Department shot down a merger of Sprint Corp (NYSE: S ) and T-Mobile US Inc (NASDAQ: TMUS ) on antitrust grounds, the third- and fourth-largest wireless companies are reportedly eager to give the deal another go. But prospective TMUS stock and S stock investors should sit on the sidelines while the drama plays out.\n\nSource: Mike Mozart via Flickr (modified)\n\nJapan's Softbank Group Corp (OTCMKTS: SFTBF ) is reportedly willing to cede its controlling interest in S to Deutsche Telekom AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS: DTEGY ), which controls T-Mobile.\n\nSoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, spent $20.1 billion to buy a controlling stake in Sprint a few years ago. The wireless provider's market cap now tops $36 billion, so it makes sense that the billionaire may be looking for an exit strategy.\n\nWhat's Going on With Sprint and T-Mobile?\n\nInterestingly, news of the potential deal was leaked during the critical Federal Communications Commission spectrum auction where merger discussions are forbidden, so it remains unclear whether this is a trial balloon.\n\nOf course, the wildcard in this mix is TMUS' colorful CEO John Legere.\n\nLegere certainly deserves credit for shaking up the wireless industry through innovative marketing, such as paying the early termination fees for customers who switch their service before their service contract expires.\n\nHe is far from foolish and loves the spotlight, taking delight in needling his rivals, including Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure. It would make sense that Legere would want to run a merged company. If for some reason, Legere wasn't a top dog, he would collect a payday of nearly $65 million if TMUS were sold, according to its latest proxy.\n\nLegere's winning way with words can change the fact that the wireless market is becoming increasingly commoditized as new entrants, including Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ), Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHTR ), squeeze margins of incumbents such as T-Mobile, S, AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ).\n\nMoreover, the move to 5G isn't going to be as easy as older technologies like 3G and 4G because it's far more complex. Experts say 5G is expected to be three times faster than 4G, which is about four times faster than 3G. Experts don't expect 5G to be deployed until 2019 at the earliest and wireless companies are scrambling to grab up all the spectrum they can ahead of time.\n\nLegere would also have his hands full integrating S. While the Overland, Kansas-based company is in better financial shape now than it was in years past, it still loses money. Some analysts have accused Sprint of underinvesting in its network to bolster its bottom line, a claim that the company vehemently denies.\n\nBottom Line on TMUS Stock and S Stock\n\nWhile odds of a merger between S stock and TMUS stock actually happening are better than they were a few years ago, let's not forget that the new resident in the White House is no slouch in the unpredictability department either.\n\nPresident Donald Trump raised a stink over the merger between AT&T and Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX ), even though there are no obvious antitrust arguments against it. Who knows what may happen with Sprint and T-Mobile?\n\nGiven the uncertainties around the wireless industry and these two companies in particular, I am going to take a pass on shares of both potential merger partners for now. S stock and TMUS stock are trading near their 52-week highs after double-digit gains over the last year, so there is no sense of urgency for investors to make a move now.\n\nI am not keen on VZ and T either given their appetites for high-priced content companies like TWX.\n\nAs of this writing, Jonathan Berr did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS) and Sprint Corp (S) Aren't Worth It … Yet appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Image Source: Waymo\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been crushing its rivals in self-driving cars, according to the latest data from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Alphabet's driverless car division -- Waymo -- reported the lowest disengagement rate among all the companies testing self-driving cars on California roads last year, meaning there were fewer times when the autonomous driving system had to be shut down.\n\nHow things look\n\n\n\nThe California DMV defines disengagement as either a failure of autonomous technology or the requirement of human intervention to switch off the autonomous mode. A lower disengagement rate indicates that Waymo's driverless cars have become better at driving themselves.\n\nIn fact, according to this data, Waymo is not just better than the rest; it is beating its rivals by a huge margin as its cars had a meager disengagement rate of 0.20 per 1,000 autonomous miles. This is down from the 0.80 disengagement rate in 2015. This seems even more impressive in light of the fact that Waymo vehicles covered longer distances than rivals and, as Techcnrunch reports, Waymo's autonomous vehicles and their engineers are set to err on the side of caution when deciding to disengage.\n\nManufacturer Autonomous miles driven in 2016 Disengagements Disengagement per 1,000 miles BMW 638 1 1.6 Waymo 635,868 124 0.2 Ford 590 3 5.1 Nissan 4,099 28 6.8 Mercedes-Benz 673 183 271.9 Tesla 550 183 332.7\n\nData Source: California DMV\n\nA low disengagement rate and more miles driven indicate that Alphabet's moonshot self-driving technology is the most successful on California roads. More importantly, the lower disengagement rate has been accomplished mostly in suburban and city driving conditions. Waymo, therefore, seems to be closer than any other company to launching its self-driving project commercially.\n\nThis is not surprising as Alphabet (then Google) began working on driverless cars in 2009 and has the first-mover advantage. Since then, its autonomous cars have driven over 2 million miles, with most of the driving taking place on city streets. Additionally, Waymo clocked 1 billion miles on the simulator last year.\n\nThe amount of time and effort put in by Alphabet's Waymo into the self-driving car project has placed it way ahead of the curve in autonomous driving. This might eventually turn Waymo's driverless rivals into potential clients if they are unable to replicate the success of its driverless tech.\n\nWaymo's rivals could start using its technology\n\nWaymo calls itself a self-driving technology company, not a car company. It currently uses a Lexus vehicle and a prototype of its own to test its driverless technology, while it is also plans to add 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans to the fleet.\n\nImage Source: Waymo\n\nIt is less likely that Alphabet will manufacture cars of its own as it seems to have charted out a different go-to-market strategy. In January, Waymo announced that it will start manufacturing sensors used in driverless cars in-house to integrate its hardware and software development. This integration should give Waymo a cost advantage and lead to stronger adoption of its driverless technology.\n\nIn fact, Waymo has reduced the cost to build a Lidar sensor -- the most crucial part of a driverless car as it uses lasers to generate maps of the car's surroundings -- by 90%. The price of a Lidar sensor was $75,000 in 2009, but it costs just $7,500 now. The integration of hardware and software under a single roof will allow Waymo to deliver seamless self-driving performance to potential customers as it is developing its sensors in association with machine learning experts.\n\nAs automakers can get turnkey self-driving solutions under a single roof, they will start turning to Waymo to power their self-driving cars. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU) is the first such example.\n\nIn May last year, Fiat Chrysler and Alphabet's Waymo struck a deal to develop 100 self-driving cars based on the Pacifica Hybrid minivan. This was Waymo's first deal with an automaker to supply its driverless technology. Last month, it was reported that both companies are going to double down on their efforts as Alphabet could add another 100 Pacifica Hybrid minivans to the Waymo fleet this year.\n\nA Bloomberg report says Alphabet is in talks with Fiat Chrysler to start a ride-sharing service with the minivans. If that's true, it would indicate that Waymo is finally taking steps to monetize its driverless technology. Honda (NYSE: HMC) , meanwhile, could be Waymo's next partner.\n\nBoth companies were in negotiations last December to put Waymo's technology into Honda's vehicles. A partnership could alter Honda's approach to developing its own driverless cars. The Japanese automaker initially wanted to get its self-driving cars onto highways by 2020, but Waymo could help it go a few steps further by adding city and suburban driving capabilities. A Honda press release says:\n\nHonda previously announced its intention to put production vehicles with automated driving capabilities on highways sometime around 2020 related to its goal of a collision-free society. In addition to these on-going efforts, this technical collaboration with Waymo could allow Honda R&D to explore a different technological approach to bring fully self-driving technology to market. These discussions are an initial step that will allow Waymo and Honda R&D to further explore the potential of a broad range of automated driving technologies.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nThe latest California data clearly indicate that Alphabet's Waymo has a far better driverless technology than any of its rivals. Waymo is using this to its advantage by partnering with automakers and showing them the strengths of its self-driving technology. This strategy of advertising its superiority in this space is a smart one as it can help Waymo win over potential clients, making it a key player in the driverless car supply chain.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares)\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It's Friday, Feb. 17, and we're talking tech and exploring Snap's IPO filing. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined on Skype by fool.com senior tech specialist Evan Niu. Evan, how's it going?\n\nEvan Niu: Pretty good, pretty good.\n\nLewis: Are you a Snapchat user? Do you have it on your phone?\n\nNiu: I recently downloaded it just to play around with it. I've read plenty about it, I know how it works, I know the gist of it. But I started playing around with it, and it's really not intuitive or easy to use. [laughs] I don't have a lot of people on there that I follow, so I certainly don't have the full experience of regular users. But I don't really see the appeal to it. It seems really niche to me.\n\nLewis: Yeah, I'll say, I am a Snapchat user. I have a lot of friends that use it. My interest will wane depending on how often my friends are using it, and that will bring me in or out of the system. But, it seems to be super popular with millennials, and given a lot of the buzz with the company and the fact that it is a big tech company that's thinking about going public, there are a lot of investors that are interested in it.\n\nNiu: Yeah, there's been so much hype around this thing. It doesn't seem to me like it has a mainstream appeal, which is the exact problem that Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) has run into over the past few years. I see a lot more closer comparisons to Twitter than Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) , which is the exact opposite storyline that Snap is going to try to sell doing its roadshow.\n\nLewis: Yeah. Listeners, to give you an idea of what we're going to talk about today, give you a little overview of Snap, the Snapchat property specifically, talk a bit about their plans to go public, and what Evan and I noticed when we dug through the S-1 that recently became available. So, we talked about, they are social media company, but they call themselves a camera company, which is interesting.\n\nNiu: I noticed this really funny coincidence -- I don't know if you would call it a coincidence -- Snapchat used to consider itself a storytelling company, and now it's calling itself a camera company. Meanwhile, GoPro used to call itself a camera company and now is trying to call itself a storytelling company. So, these two companies, they have this weird identity thing where they want to be each other, and I don't get why, because it's not like GoPro is doing very well. I think it's kind of a weird thing rebrand themselves as a camera company. I mean, they have the new Spectacle glasses with cameras, but I don't know. It's just a weird identity to me.\n\nLewis: Yeah. For listeners who might not be familiar with the social media platform Snapchat, basically, you can think of it as a messaging platform where you are, for the most part, shooting quick, instantly deleted pictures and videos to you and your friends. You can also post them as stories. It has gained a lot of popularity with the millennial group. User count is still kind of low, we can talk about that a little bit, but the company is planning to go public, looking to raise $3 billion via the public markets in an issuance that would value the whole company a somewhere between $20 [billion] to $25 billion. As tech IPOs go, this might be one of the biggest ones for 2017.\n\nNiu: Yeah, definitely. It's definitely the most exciting, the most looked forward to. People have been waiting for this thing for years.\n\nLewis: Yeah, and anything that's consumer-facing is naturally going to have a lot more buzz to it. I think there might be some folks out there who are saying, \"Wait a minute, I thought I saw an announcement that this company planned to IPO back in the fall of 2016. Why are we just getting the S-1 and all the information about the company in the past couple weeks?\" That's because Snap opted to go public via the confidential IPO process. This process and this approach is a byproduct of the 2012 Jumpstart Our Businesses Act. Basically, under this updated legislation, companies with under $1 billion in annual revenue can file paperwork for an IPO confidentially with the SEC. That allows the company to go back and forth with the regulatory agency without alerting the public that they are planning on IPO-ing, although Snap chose to do so anyway. Then, once the company decides they do want to go forward with an issuance, the filing must be made public at least three weeks prior to the IPO roadshow beginning, which is when the underwriting investment banks begin talking to clients and building interest in a potential issuance. This is all to say, while the \"confidential IPO\" name might sound kind of shady, this is something that's totally on the up-and-up. And that is the reason why we only got a look at the company's books and the S-1 earlier this month, even though they announced intentions to IPO a ways back.\n\nNiu: Right. I think part of the purpose is to, like you mentioned, avoid public scrutiny for the early drafts of the S-1. All companies always have to file the S-1, but this way they can refine it without all the public scrutiny, looking at it and scrutinizing it. I think the idea is to encourage more companies to explore the IPO process, and if companies do end up going public, they get more capital, and it just boosts the economy in terms of more investments happening. I think that's the goal. But, yeah, it is a little weird when you hear \"confidential.\"\n\nLewis: Yeah, and I think it also gives companies the opportunity to maybe think about going public and walk back without sharing all of their business information publicly. So, you can test the waters and see if you're ready, and you might decide you're not, but you don't have to go through the question of your business practices, if you think you're going to file and you have to publicly walk back.\n\nNiu: Right, exactly.\n\nLewis: So, that's part of it. There are some adjustments in the regulatory requirements for how far back a company needs to provide financial statements, as well. But really, all in all, it's a tool that allows small-growing companies to keep some of their core business info private and make the going-public process a little bit easier. And that's really all there is to the confidential IPO process. Given that the company's S-1 filing became public earlier this month, I think it's fairly safe to assume we're going to see Snap trading on the New York Stock Exchange sometime in the next couple months. Evan?\n\nNiu: Yeah, seems like it's coming.\n\nLewis: Considering that they are a social media company, I think it makes the most sense to start looking at their user base and what's going on there. That's kind of the lifeblood of businesses like Facebook and Twitter, and Snap is really no different. Within their S-1, they mention, \"We assess the health of our business by measuring daily active users because we believe that this metric is the most reliable way to understand engagement on our platform.\" So, it's clear that this is what they're honing it on as a key metric, and it's what investors are going to be watching as well.\n\nNiu: Yeah. I did find it interesting that they don't disclose monthly active users, they only disclose daily active users, which is right around 160 million. With social media companies, I always tend to look at sequential growth as opposed to year-over-year growth, because with user base, that's the nature, there's no seasonality, it's just how much you can grow over time. So, I look at sequential. In that respect, Snap's growth is really decelerating -- it's grinding to a halt, almost. And the company tries to explain this in saying, \"Oh, it's because we haven't come out with any big new product innovation.\" And, of course, that has an impact, but you also have to worry about competition, because Facebook has done a really good job copying a lot of Snapchat's features, especially the Story thing, which is now on Instagram. Facebook already has, I think, about 150 million daily active users using Stories now. And they launched that last year, and it's an exact replica. So, you have to wonder if that's what's taking a bite out of it. And, obviously, Facebook is much bigger, they have more resources, they can innovate and develop faster. It's really Mark Zuckerberg, and Silicon Valley's -- I mean, Snapchat isn't based in Silicon Valley, but Facebook certainly is -- and Facebook tried to buy them, and if they can't buy them, they'll copy them, and they compete, and that's exactly what they're doing. And they're doing a really good job so far. So, I think there is some concern about competition and whether or not Snap can really keep up.\n\nLewis: Yeah. And Facebook famously made Snapchat an offer, I believe it was somewhere around $5 billion or so, a little ways back, and CEO Evan Spiegel said, \"No, we're going to see what we can do with this on our own.\" If they wind up going public at this gaudy valuation, it certainly works out well for him, but you wonder if that might have stoked the competitive fire in Mark Zuckerberg a little bit.\n\nNiu: And he can also empathize, because he did the exact same thing with Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . [laughs] So many people tried to buy Facebook, and he said, \"No, I want to do my own thing,\" and now Facebook is enormous and he is one of the richest men in the world. [laughs]\n\nLewis: Yeah it's hard to blame him for that. To put some numbers on what's going on with their user growth, like you said, year-over-year, the numbers look really great. They're up 48%. But sequentially, Q3 to Q4 of 2016, growth was only 3%. So, if you look at the graph that they provided in their S-1, it does look like growth is flattening out a little bit. Given that so much of the expectation for these social platforms is continuing to build user base, and being able to monetize that user base really well, you have to worry about that as an ongoing risk for the business.\n\nNiu: Yeah. If they are a niche product, which, it seems that way to me, then this could be it...and, obviously, 160 million daily users is a pretty big number. And you can build a healthy business there if you keep your expectations modest and try to build around that base. Whereas, if you're trying to grow, if you're spending a ton of money trying to grow it, and you can't, which is exactly the problem that Twitter is having, then that's when it starts to hurt financially. But if you just accept it for what it is and plan your business accordingly, you can build a pretty decent business out of it.\n\nLewis: Yeah. For some context, I went back and looked at Facebook's S-1 to see how they stacked up when they went public. At the time, they had 480 million daily active users, and they were posting 48% year-over-year growth and 6% sequential growth. You hear that and think, \"Well, those growth rates are kind of similar, right?\" The difference was scale. Even when they were doing single-digit sequential growth quarter-to-quarter, they were still adding tens of millions of users, not five million, as Snapchat did last quarter. I think that's a huge risk, especially as you see a more entrenched competitor taking what's working for you and has a lot of traction with users that you already have on your platform and just applying it to this massive user base that they have.\n\nNiu: Right. Facebook is interesting because they started earlier, before the really big rise of mobile. So a lot of their early days were on desktop. Then, they had to navigate the transition to mobile, which they have done ridiculously well, far better than I think anyone ever imagined, whereas companies like Twitter and Snap, they came out on mobile from the beginning. Particularly Snap -- I mean, there is no desktop Snapchat.\n\nLewis: Right. Beyond the user base, I think a lot of people want to know what's going on with the financials as well. In 2016, the company booked $404 million in revenue, up from $58 million in revenue in 2015. That is humongous growth, but that is on a very tiny denominator. The reality with Snapchat is that they really just kind of turned on the monetization engine there, and have only really rolled out ads for a very short period of time. Right now, even, it's still a pretty ad-light experience for users.\n\nNiu: Yeah. They only recently released their API to automate ad sales, which is a hugely important part of scaling for advertising businesses, because it allows your advertisers to do this automatically, it's much less labor-intensive to do it. So, they literally only did this a few months ago, and it's still in beta. So, it's very early days in terms of their ad business.\n\nLewis: And that's really what's going to be making up most of the money for Snap overall, right? Advertising made up 96% of Snap's revenue in 2016. I don't expect that to change. We talked about how they have the Spectacles as well, and they bill themselves as a camera company. There might be some hardware applications somewhere down the road, but in terms of a scalable, high-margin business, they're going to look to monetize the Snapchat platform first, because if they can do it well, the opportunity is the biggest there.\n\nNiu: Oh, absolutely. You can't make money on hardware. Those glasses...you might make a little bit of money, but the whole point of that is to get people to use the platform.\n\nLewis: Exactly, yeah. And that just feeds into the idea of people posting their stories and sending stuff to friends, and making that video and picture capture a little bit easier. Looking down at their bottom line, they ran a $500 million loss in 2016, down even more from losses of $370 million in 2015. The company is also free cash flow negative to the tune of $670 million. No surprise there. It's a high-growth tech company, very rarely are they profitable when they go public. But one thing, I don't want to nitpick too much with costs, but one line item that popped out to me was general and administrative expenses are $165 million, which is more than they spent in sales and marketing, and almost as much as the company spent in R&D. And they talk about how this is attributable to headcount increasing 200% year over year, but from a corporate strategy perspective, it seems like there's sinking a ton of money into G&A. I would think, if anything, the big money suck would be on the tech side, and gaining talent and pushing the platform in a new direction.\n\nNiu: Particularly with them talking about how important product innovation is to driving user growth, you would think they would invest more in that. But yeah, overall, I'm not too surprised at their costs in terms of their operating expenses. I just don't know what they're going to do next to try to really grow the platform more. Why aren't they spending more money on R&D?\n\nLewis: Yeah. And they're going to have to. If you look at the current valuation...we talked about how they're probably going to end up IPOing somewhere in the $20 [billion] to $25 billion valuation range. That would mean that they are trading at 62X trailing sales. Not earnings, sales. That is a huge number.\n\nNiu: Yeah, it's ridiculous. I remember when Twitter and Facebook went public a few years back. They both went probably right around 25-26X sales. And back then, I was like, \"Wow, that's really expensive.\" [laughs] And now, 62X sales, it's unheard of. It just speaks to the hype around this company. Of course, the valuation is going to change, and we don't know what they're actually going to price the IPO at. Right now, everything is really preliminary, and they don't price the IPO until the night before it actually goes public. And, of course, that's all a function of how successful the roadshow is. If they can really drum up investor interest, or conversely, if they don't, then that's going to really drive what the IPO price is at. But there's a possibility that this goes higher if they have a really good roadshow, which is insane. Can you imagine them getting closer to 70X sales? Who knows at this point -- it's not impossible for that to happen. It's just insane that this company would be able to command such a premium.\n\nLewis: And I think another layer of context here: Were it to IPO and have a valuation somewhere in the mid 20s, it would basically be valued at twice Twitter's current valuation. According to analysts, Snapchat has more daily active users than Twitter, but Twitter brought in 5X as much revenue last year. So, when you think about what a really successful ad launch would look like, and building out the platform in a way that has non-invasive ads that don't really detract too much from user experience, and you start to get into that $2.5 billion annual ad revenue, and building on that. And they would be doing that at twice the valuation that Twitter is currently at. So, you just look at the numbers, and it's really tough to make it work, the way it's currently priced.\n\nNiu: Yeah. There's no way I'm touching this thing. [laughs]\n\nLewis: Beyond valuation and some of the user growth issues, I know that you particularly wanted to hone in on some of the stuff with voting rights with the shares they'll actually be issuing.\n\nNiu: Yeah, I think it's really interesting. The shares that they're issuing to the public get zero votes. Not even one, zero. A lot of tech companies have been doing this thing for a long time where they give the public shares one vote, and the insiders get these supervoting shares with 10 votes or more. That allows the company founders and insiders to maintain control no matter what. Google is probably the biggest and earliest example of this. Even today, collectively, all the insiders, between the executives and directors of Google, they collectively control about 60% of the voting power. So, public investors really have no say. If they disagree with something, they have no recourse. Facebook is, of course, another good example, with Zuckerberg himself personally controlling about 60% of the voting power. So, he wouldn't even have to ask anyone, he just does whatever he wants. So, the question is, is it really a big deal? Investors are now used to this idea that they don't get a say and how these companies are run. The difference with Snap is that they're basically being upfront and being like, \"You don't even get to pretend like you have a say.\"\n\nCertainly, it's all bad from a corporate governance perspective on principle, because obviously, it's better for shareholders to have a say. But at the same time, you can see that it's worked quite well for companies like Google and Facebook. Imagine if Google shareholders had a vote in telling Google not to do all this random side stuff that they explore, you could argue that the company wouldn't be as successful as it has. There is a case to be made that this is a good thing, in some situations. But we don't know how it's going to play out for Snap.\n\nLewis: Yeah. I think one of the reasons why I have a bone to pick with it is, you have the two company co-founders, Evan Spiegel, the CEO, and Robert Murphy, the CTO. They are the sole owners of the supervoting Class C shares, which get 10 votes. Any Class Bs or Cs that are sold are transferred automatically convert to the Class As, the non-voting shares. Anything that would happen with them, they have a supermajority, and anything that might happen would continue to concentrate that power. So, you look at these tech companies later on issuing non-voting shares, or with Facebook, deciding that they want to split its stock and issue C shares so that Mark Zuckerberg can retain his control of the company and be able to give away the non-voting shares through his charitable efforts. Mark Zuckerberg has demonstrated that he has the right combination of that tech-forward thinking and the business savvy in order to run one of the world's biggest companies and do it incredibly successfully. Spiegel and Murphy don't have that track record.\n\nNiu: Right. Zuckerberg has definitely earned some respect. He's really demonstrated that he can execute on these bigger-picture strategies and growing Facebook in the way that he has. The stock split thing is funny because, like you were saying, he voted it in personally, single-handedly. It doesn't matter if you didn't like the stock split, which hasn't actually occurred yet even though it's been approved, because he said it would happen. But, yeah, you really need to trust these founders. And Spiegel is 26 or 27. Of course, Zuckerberg was too, a few years back. But, to your point, he just doesn't have a track record. And it's like, what has he done beyond creating Snapchat? You can't really point to any single great business move and be like, \"That was a really smart strategy, that was a really good move.\" You know? You have to have a lot of faith.\n\nLewis: One of the other things I'm seeing a lot of people talk about, digging through the S-1 and doing their homework on the company, is the company's cloud strategy.\n\nNiu: Yeah, this is really an interesting topic for me because Snapchat is doing something that's really unprecedented in terms of how they're approaching their cloud infrastructure. Most of the time, when companies are launching these apps and online services and consumer-based products, eventually, when they get to a certain point, they start investing in their own infrastructure, either by building their own data centers and servers in co-located facilities that they share with other companies, or building their own. Facebook is building its seventh data center, and it's fully owned. Twitter co-locates its data centers. Snap is not doing any of that. Snap is relying 100% on third-party cloud infrastructure providers, Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. It's just crazy because the scale at which they're operating, it would normally make sense to start investing in it yourself, but Snap is content to basically continue to do this through third parties. It's not clear if this is going to work, because no one has ever tried this before, so it's this huge experiment, and there are a lot of risks because you don't get to control your infrastructure in your back end, which is incredibly important to your business, and you're also spending a ton of money. Obviously, building the infrastructure yourself costs a ridiculous amount of money. But over time, it will eventually pay for itself.\n\nSo, what Snap is doing is that they committed to spending $3 billion total over the next five years between Google and Amazon combined. Google is the primary provider, and Amazon is basically a backup. They're spending $400 million a year on Google. The spending commitment with Amazon ramps up, it starts at like $50 million and then it's $350 million by the end. But that's a huge spending commitment. This is, very specifically, their largest cost. If you look at their financials, the cost revenue is predominantly composed of these infrastructure costs, and cost revenue is greater than revenue. So, they have a negative gross margin right now because of this strategy very specifically. At the same time, because of these long-term commitments, the pressure is now on for the ad business. You have to grow ad sales to these levels just to keep up with it, just to break even on gross profit, before you even start talking about operating expenses.\n\nThe pressure to grow the ad business is incredibly high, and they have almost no experience doing that. So, it's a huge risk not only operationally, but it's also a huge risk financially. If you are unable to grow your ad business enough to cover these costs, you're just going to be hemorrhaging cash. And it doesn't matter how popular the service is, if you're just blowing through money and you can't bring in enough to cover these costs, it's not sustainable. We don't know if they'll be able to do it or not, but the point is, the risk that's there is insane. They have to really turn up these ad sales just to cover their spending commitments.\n\nLewis: Yeah, beyond all of the general investor interest in Snap that will undoubtedly be there for the next couple years and beyond, I think there will be a lot of tech insiders watching this decision. If it works, maybe they'll use it as a blueprint, and decide that it allows the company to be more nimble. But, you have to wonder about the company's ability to control costs, and have total control over what's going on with the IT infrastructure, because that's how everyone is interacting with their product.\n\nNiu: Yeah. Everyone in the cloud infrastructure market is watching very closely, because they're like, \"This is crazy, how much this company is spending.\" It's great news for the cloud infrastructure market, of course, because it's one of the biggest customers out there. They're bringing in a lot of money, and everyone is going to see if this can really work. I mean, it's worth noting that Snap is hedging itself saying it might eventually -- in the S-1, it says they may choose to invest in its infrastructure at some point. A few months ago, they actually poached Amazon's head of data centers for AWS. So, it's like, there are some hints that they're exploring the idea of doing their own infrastructure. But, at the same time, it probably wouldn't be for the next five years because of these commitments. So, yeah, they're still leaving themselves an out. But it seems really risky. It might work out great. In the event that things go down -- let's say the service just crashes -- that does let them ramp down variable costs with more flexibility, as opposed to, if you spend all this money to build all this infrastructure and the service dies for whatever reason, theoretically, then you would be stuck with all this infrastructure you paid all this money for. Versus, just paying it as a variable expense based on usage. So, it's going to be something that's going to be very interesting to see play out, not just because of Snap, but also because of the implications for the bigger companies that are providing these services like Amazon and Google, also Microsoft . Microsoft would certainly like to get a piece of that spending. But yeah, I think that has a lot of implications for the broader infrastructure market.\n\nLewis: To bring it back around to the stock itself and how we're looking at it, it seems like you and I are in the same camp here -- we have some concerns over user growth, the valuation as it's currently being reported, we'll see what happens after they run through the roadshow, but the valuation is a little too rich for us to really even look at too much, also we have a lot of questions about the competitive risks with some Facebook and Instagram looming out there, and possibly being able to just grab features and drop it on their installed base. Does that wrap how we feel about Snap? Anything else you want to add in there, Evan?\n\nNiu: I don't think Snap's investable, honestly. There are so many risks, the financials don't make sense, the valuation doesn't make sense, you get no voting. [laughs] I don't doubt that shares will pop from the offering just because of the hype, but as we've seen with many overhyped IPOs in recent years, it only takes a few months for the market to sober up. Plus, Snap's also doing a different thing with the lock-up period. Employees will be able to sell sooner -- the lock-up expires for employees sooner than is typical. Normally, it's about 180 days. They're going to allow their employees to sell at 150 days, along with all the co-founders. So, there could be some selling pressure as all these investors and employees cash out. The employees and all the insiders are going to make a ton of money, but as far as public investors go, I don't know. It's also worth mentioning that their stock-based compensation expenses so far are quite small because they're still private. I think last year it was something like $30-some million, which is a tiny proportion of their expenses. But when companies go public, the liquidity event triggers a ridiculous increase in stock-based compensation cost because now that stock is worth so much more. And that's typical for all companies that go public -- right after they go public, they have a huge increase in stock-based comp. That's something to be aware that is coming. Plus, they're probably going to start unloading pretty quickly. I don't know, I just don't see, after the initial honeymoon, how this thing can really go even further, after it's already at such a ridiculous level.

The company says this employee is Anthony Levandowski.\n\nAnthony Levandowski is the founder of Otto. Otto is a self-driving car startup that was created in 2016. Uber bought this startup in 2016 and added Levandowski to its team. Levandowski was a previous employee of the GOOGL car company before founding Otto.\n\nAccording to Waymo, Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential and proprietary design files for its hardware systems six weeks before resigning from the GOOGL company. Among those files were the company's design data for its LiDAR system.\n\nWaymo says that it has decided to file a lawsuit against Uber after receiving an email from one of its suppliers. The supplier makes parts for the GOOGL company's LiDAR system. In the email was a picture of a circuit board for Uber's own LiDAR technology. Waymo says this circuit board looked incredibly like the one it created for its own LiDAR system.\n\nWaymo says that after conducting some research, it has discovered that other former employees also downloaded confidential information from the company. These employees now work for Uber and Otto. The GOOGL company claims this was an organized act to steal its trade secrets and intellectual property.\n\nWaymo also claims that Anthony Levandowski expressed his desire to \"replicate\" the company's technology as a rival. It claims he told employees of this plan months before his retirement.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Sues Uber Over Allegedly Stolen Technology appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn a few weeks, the Snapchat IPO will hit the markets, and it seems like a pretty good bet that there will be quite a bit of interest in the deal. But unless you are a mega-wealthy investor or manage a financial institution, you'll likely not get any shares in the offering. Rather, you'll have to buy SNAP in the after-market, when the valuation will probably be much higher.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSo is it any wonder that IPOs can be a raw deal?\n\nThat may be true, but when it comes to investing in the big-growth opportunities, there really is no need to speculate in the IPO market. Hey, there are a variety of interesting stocks currently on the market that should be good enough.\n\nTake a Look at GOOGL Stock\n\nOne to consider is actually Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ). Granted, the company is fairly mature, having been founded in 1998.\n\nBut what's important about GOOGL stock is that the company has global brand, scale, infrastructure and massive user base to play in critical growth markets. Such factors are must-haves for getting the attention of sponsors, especially those that have massive budgets.\n\nThis is why a company like Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) has struggled so much. In fact, in the latest quarter, the company's revenues increased by a mere 0.9% on a year-over-year basis to $717.2 million, marking the 10th consecutive quarter of top-line deceleration. U.S. revenues fell by 4% to $440 million and of course, the company has yet to generate a profit on a GAAP basis.\n\nAll this happened even though there were major catalysts from the presidential election, NFL streaming and the holiday season.\n\nBy comparison, in the latest quarter Alphabet reported an impressive 22% jump in revenues to $26.1 billion and GAAP earnings of $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per share on GOOGL stock.\n\nBut this shouldn't be much of a surprise. The fact is that GOOGL is positioned nicely for major growth categories like video (YouTube), mobile (Android, Google Play and Waze), devices (Pixel and Google Home) and cloud computing. All these represent multi-billion-dollar market opportunities - and should all provide nice long-term drivers for GOOGL stock.\n\nJust look at Waze, which Alphabet Inc purchased for $1.3 billion back in October 2013. Interestingly enough, this price tag may have been a bargain! Note that GOOGL plans to launch a ride- hailing service - similar to Uber's - in various cities in the U.S. that is based on the Waze platform.\n\nBy the way, back in 2013, the company also invested $258 million in Uber.\n\nAlthough, when it comes to GOOGL stock, the real play is likely to be the impact from the company's major investments in deep learning and AI (artificial intelligence). Let's face it, Alphabet has a big-time advantage because of its experience in handling massive amounts of information with search.\n\nAlready GOOGL is introducing great AI products, such as its Assistant offering (the app allows for sophisticated natural language conversations). But the company has also included more than 350 AI features across many of the company's other products during 2016.\n\nAccording to Alphabet Inc CEO Sundar Pichai : \"As I've shared before, computing is moving from a mobile-first to AI-first with more universal ambient and intelligent computing that you can interact with naturally, all made smarter by the progress we are making with machine learning.\"\n\nMore importantly, GOOGL stock is currently trading at an attractive valuation. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is roughly 22X. Although, if you strip out the $86 billion in the bank, the multiple is 19. And this is roughly in line with Wall Street's 19% five-year forecasted growth rate.\n\nOK, then what about Snap? True, growth is ramping at a rapid pace. But then again, the company has only recently begun to monetize its user base, so it does not take much to generate huge spikes.\n\nYet it appears that - based on estimates from Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS ) - Snap will churn out roughly $2 billion in revenues in 2018 . But this will still mean that the company will trade at over 10 times revenues on a two-year forward basis . As for GOOGL stock, it is currently at a price-to-sales multiple of 6.4X.\n\nSo again, if you don't get shares of Snap (and you probably won't - at least the at the offering price), then it's no big deal. Buying GOOGL stock should be just fine.\n\nTom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blogIPO Playbook and also has his own free iOS app to estimate your tax refund, which is at PathwayTax.com .

We explore this idea in the latest edition of the Dutram Report where Eric Dutram talks with Kevin Quigg, Chief Strategist of ACSI Funds. Kevin's company is at the forefront of customer satisfaction research, and they have some great insights into the link between having satisfied customers, and satisfied investors too. To listen to the podcast, click here: ( https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/246643/is-customer-satisfaction-the-hidden-key-to-stock-outperformance )\n\nAs consumers, we have all been frustrated by companies which did not meet our expectations. Either poor service or a low-quality product, the end result was always the desire to do less business with the given company.\n\nHowever, on the other side of the coin, there are those companies out there that go above and beyond, time and time again. Those are the companies I like to frequent, and I have always wondered if these types of firms-which have a long history of satisfying their customers-end up making better investments too.\n\nWell, in this edition of the Dutram Report , I talk to Kevin Quigg, chief strategist at ACSI Funds, for some insights into this topic and if this idea works as an investment.\n\nInside ACSI\n\nKevin is an expert in the American Customer Satisfaction Index, a benchmark that exists to find companies that customers either like, or would rather avoid. This is done by looking at a few key areas of the customer satisfaction process, including customer expectations, perceived value, and perceived quality.\n\nThis data has proven to be extremely popular with companies, as it helps them to keep tabs on the competition and to see their relative standing among their peers too. But the data can also be used to shape the outlook for companies and to see how they are trending in terms of customer satisfaction, which can help to show which companies are moving in the right direction.\n\nACSI's idea is that customer satisfaction leads to customer loyalty, which leads to additional consumer spending which ultimately leads to long-term stock appreciation. This intuitively makes sense, and now there is a way to use this strategy in ETF form.\n\nThe ETF\n\nThis is via ACSI Funds' American Customer Satisfaction Core Alpha ETF ( ACSI ). This product holds securities that have high ACSI customer satisfaction scores, with the theory being that these will outperform their low-satisfaction peers.\n\nCurrent holdings include well-respected names like Apple ( AAPL ), Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) and Alphabet ( GOOG ) just to name a few, though there are dozens of names in the portfolio. And if you are wondering what is done for sectors where customer satisfaction levels aren't as readily available, such as energy or materials, big ETFs-such as XLE or XLB -are utilized in order to give more broad market-like exposure.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFor a more in-depth look at this index as well as its investable counterpart, make sure to listen to the podcast for additional information. We highlight some of the strengths and potential pitfalls when it comes to this strategy, and how it might fit into a portfolio too.\n\nSo, make sure to listen to this edition of the Dutram Report for a closer look at this interesting strategy for tackling the equity world, and the potential for investors to exploit this simple idea for their portfolios.

(NYSE: MBLY) , an Israeli company that specializes in advanced driver-safety systems, has begun rolling out a new offering that will help the self-driving cars of the near future function in more areas -- and your next new car might be enlisted to help.\n\nThe new offering, called Road Experience Management, or \"REM,\" is a system that will create highly detailed maps that self-driving cars can use to back up (or double-check) the inputs from their sensors. It will use data collected by cameras on many new cars, starting with the 2018 model year.\n\nThis is a big deal, not just for Mobileye but also for its customers -- which include nearly all of the world's automakers -- and people who are hoping to have access to self-driving cars in the near future.\n\nMobileye's chief technology officer, Amnon Shashua, outlined the company's approach to self-driving in a presentation last month. Image source: Mobileye N.V.\n\nThe problem: Self-driving cars need special maps\n\nWhen the first fully self-driving cars arrive on the market in a few years, their capabilities will be limited. In most cases, the cars will be \"geofenced,\" restricted to driving in particular areas. (In the widely used industry nomenclature, these are called \"Level 4\" systems. \"Level 5\" systems that are self-driving with no restrictions are probably still many years away.)\n\nThe cars will be geofenced because most of the self-driving systems under development require specialized high-definition maps to work safely. The maps help the car's \"brain\" figure out exactly where it is relative to things like curbs and road barriers, providing a layer of redundancy beyond the car's sensors. (That may sound, well, redundant. But it's critical to ensuring that self-driving systems meet the required standards of safety.)\n\nObviously, the companies that can access the best and most extensive maps will have a competitive advantage. Cars equipped with their systems will be able to drive themselves to more places. That means that the race is on not only to create maps covering the widest possible areas, but to create ways to ensure that the maps are always up to date.\n\nMobileye has a direct stake in this race. It's gearing up to bring a Level 4 system to market by the end of 2019 , in partnership with Delphi Automotive (NYSE: DLPH) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) . That system will be marketed to automakers, who will probably be able to have it in showrooms (or in service with ride-hailing companies) by about 2021.\n\nThis self-driving test vehicle incorporates a prototype of the system being developed by Delphi, Mobileye, and Intel.

And your next new car might help.\n\nHow Mobileye will build -- and profit from -- the maps\n\nThe idea behind REM is that Mobileye can use the cameras on existing cars as a low-cost way to harvest the data needed to make the maps, as well as other information that will be useful to self-driving cars. Many new cars have front-facing cameras that are used for adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warnings, and other advanced driver-assist systems (or \"ADAS\") -- and many of those camera-based systems were sold to the automakers by Mobileye.\n\nIn recent months, Mobileye has been reaching out to its automaker clients, inviting them to join the REM effort by allowing data from their vehicles to be collected. In exchange, Mobileye is offering a share of the revenue it expects to generate from selling that data to mapmaking companies.\n\nSo far, Volkswagen AG and BMW AG have signed up to allow REM to gather data from their vehicles, starting in the 2018 model year. During this past week's earnings call , Mobileye's CTO Amnon Shashua said that his company expects to announce a third deal within a few weeks, and to have the majority of its automaker partners signed up by the end of 2017. (These deals include extensive privacy safeguards; the data won't be linked to specific car owners.)\n\nShashua explained how revenue will be generated from the REM effort:\n\nWe believe revenue will be generated from two separate products [of REM]. One is the map, which is a critical input to autonomous vehicle systems. The other is a broad set of real-time dynamic information such as traffic density, weather conditions and open parking spots. We expect the primary customers for each of these products to be mapmakers, and we recently announced engagements with both [high-definition mapping company] HERE and the Japanese mapping company Zenrin.\n\nThe upshot: An important step as the self-driving race shapes up\n\nAssuming that a majority of the world's major automakers do in fact join the REM program, Mobileye's effort stands to put its venture with Delphi and Intel in a strong competitive position as the market for self-driving systems takes shape.\n\nI've argued that the idea of a \"race\" to self-driving technology isn't a useful way for investors to think . Level 4 systems will be available to all automakers within four or five years; there won't be much advantage to the company that comes to market first. We won't be able to think in terms of \"winners\" until the details of the different offerings become clear.\n\nThat process is starting. REM makes it likely that the Delphi-Mobileye-Intel offering will have access to maps that allow it to operate in many areas of the world, right from the start. For investors, that makes the success of the partners' system more likely, and an investment in Mobileye -- the purest play of the three -- a little more compelling.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Mobileye\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.*\n\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Mobileye wasn't one of them!

The money had to come from somewhere, so Wall Street sold mega-cap tech to chase the trend then. Stocks like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) fell, but eventually recovered. GOOGL stock even set a new all-time high. Then came earnings season.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe reaction to GOOGL earnings was brutal - shares fell 6% in four days. Luckily, GOOGL bulls stepped in and defended the stock. As a result, Alphabet Inc has all but erased the entire post-earnings dip.\n\nI've always said that the short-term reaction to earnings is purely a gamble. And that the longer-term fundamentals will eventually prevail.\n\nMy interpretation of Alphabet earnings is that the Google machine is still on rails! It prints money from multiple assets that have more than a billion users; management is a proven winner; and spending on crazy ventures has abated. Alphabet now even have official structures to profit from the self-driving auto arena.\n\nSo, for the long term, I have no real worry for GOOGL stock other than the general equity market gyrations. If markets sell off, so will GOOGL. Conversely, I don't expect shares to fall too far on their own from the company's own actions.\n\nGOOGL Options Play\n\nOptions are liquid enough to allow me to set in motion trades with ample buffers that I expect to be sure winners given the current environment. The trick is to find a level where GOOGL stock will be defended by fundamental investors. Then I sell risk against those levels and sit back and let time work for me.\n\nYou've read the statistic that most options expire worthless. So I'd want to be a seller of options since the buyers lose most often.\n\nThe Bet: Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $660 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $13 per contract to open. The 20% buffer from current price gives this trade a 95% theoretical chance of success. Selling naked puts is dangerous. Not everyone is comfortable exposing themselves to such downside risk. If GOOGL stock falls below my sold put, I am committed to owning the stock at that level. So anything below $647 per share would accrue losses if GOOGL falls 30% or so.\n\nSince risk tolerances vary, I will offer an alternate trade with similar metrics but with a finite risk profile. The alternate version would better fit smaller accounts, too.\n\nThe Alternate: Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $670/$660 credit put spread. This, too, is a bullish trade for which I collect $1.25 per contract to open. The price buffer is about the same, so the theoretical chance of success is still more than 90%. If successful, this trade yields 14% on money risked. I still need GOOGL stock to stay above my sold spread to win.\n\nUsually, I like to balance my trade by selling opposite risk. In this case, I will offer the option to do that, but I will delay entry a little in this \"animal spirited\" equity market.\n\nThe Hedge (Optional): Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $1060/$1080 credit call spread. This is a bearish trade for which I collect $1.50 per contract to open. I need GOOGL to stay below my sold strike to win. There is no $10 wide spread available yet, so I can't make it a perfect iron condor. This trade, if successful, can yield 8% on money risked.\n\nUsually, in perfect iron condors, my potential yield would almost double because I can only lose on one side or the other. In this case, the two sides will balance, but not perfectly. I am not required to hold these options trades through expiration. I can close any of them for partial gains or losses.\n\nNicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com .

Revenue growth was driven by both the advertising segment, which includes display ads on Sina and Weibo, and non-advertising revenues, which include value added services on weibo.com. Additionally, Sina's company-wide gross margin (GAAP) for the quarter improved by almost 5 percentage points to 70% for the quarter. A higher proportion of advertising revenue across both portal and Weibo businesses was key to improved margins. Within the advertising segments, the contribution from small and medium enterprise (SME) customers was crucial to growth. (Read more: How Crucial Are Small & Mid-Sized Businesses For Sina's Advertising Business? )\n\nA similar trend was observed through the year, as Sina generated just over $1 billion in revenues through the year, which was around 17% higher on a y-o-y basis. Top line growth came from both advertising and non-advertising (primarily from Weibo) while the company's gross margin for the full year stood at 65.6%, almost 4 percentage points higher than previous year levels. This was primarily due to expansion in advertising gross margins, as the gross margin for the non-advertising segment compressed by 170 basis points to 58.4%, as shown below.\n\nThe company has successfully improved operating efficiency, and its largely fixed operational costs led the company's cash operating expenses to stay flat over previous year levels. Continuing the trend from previous quarters, Sina reported roughly flat operating expenses for the fourth quarter and the full year as a result. Sina's non-GAAP operating expenses for 2016 stood at $498 million, only about 3% higher than the previous year. As a result, Sina's non-GAAP operating income was almost 200% higher than the year-ago levels at $179 million. This resulted in its non-GAAP net income increasing by almost 100% to $109 million for the full year.\n\nSee our complete analysis for Sina\n\nView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):\n\nGlobal Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap\n\nMore Trefis Research", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChoosing between buying Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is the classic choice between value and growth. And if you were confused, AAPL stock is the value play, while GOOGL stock provides the growth.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhile Apple shares have been on fire in 2017 - up 17% - you can still get in for a price-to-earnings ratio around 16, lower than what investors are paying for the average S&P 500 stock. You also get a dividend of 57 cents per share, more than covered by earnings.\n\nGOOGL is the growth play. Revenues increased to $90 billion last year from $55 billion in 2013. This justifies a P/E of nearly 30. The shares are also up 17% over the last 12 months.\n\nRight now, investors prefer value over growth and Apple stock is doing better than Alphabet. But this isn't the proverbial choice between a rock and a hard place, instead, it's more like picking between cookies and ice cream. I own both stocks, I have owned them for several years, and I have profited handsomely holding both.\n\nThe Case for AAPL Stock\n\nNo technology company is as adept at squeezing profit from hardware as Apple.\n\nWhile other smartphone companies struggle to make money, Apple regularly brings $1 of every $4 in iPhone sales to its bottom line. Its closed ecosystem is perceived as safe and their products last for years.\n\nThe current case for Apple stock, however, has little to do with hardware. Instead, services now drive the stock forward. Services like its app store - from which it takes a 30% cut of sales - Apple Music, iPay and iCloud have become huge, with $7.17 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter alone. The success of its services enabled Apple to become a power in the cloud by putting more than $12 billion into capital spending last year. It's no secret that the cloud is a capital-intensive business, but Apple has been able to out-spend cloud rivals without disturbing its profit machine.\n\nAAPL had over $246 billion in cash on its books at the end of last year, most of it kept overseas. The Trump administration has proposed a one-time tax cut to encourage Apple to bring this cash back to the U.S. That's enough money to buy companies such as Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) or Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS ) outright.\n\nWhen analysts subtract the Apple cash from its market cap, they find the company itself valued at \"just\" $460 billion, with a PE of 9 and just over two times sales. If you're looking for a cheap value stock, poised for an era of unprecedented growth, with plenty of safety and margin for error, they say, buy AAPL today.\n\nThe Case for GOOGL Stock\n\nThe artists formerly known as Google have a different case to make.\n\nAlphabet has become a cash flow monster , delivering nearly $40 billion in operating cash flow last year. Its revenue grew nearly 20%, and GOOGL's operating margin is over 25%.\n\nClouds scale like no invention ever seen before, and Alphabet delivers a global search service for literally nothing. Its Android operating system is on 87% of all smartphones , against just 12% for Apple, and Alphabet doesn't have to build or sell them. It just watches as customers who own them come to its services.\n\nBut with no fanfare, GOOGL has also become a power in hardware. Its Chromebooks now outsell Apple's Macintosh line with about 5% of the PC market. Alphabet now participates in all the hardware markets pioneered by rivals - from virtual reality headsets to streaming devices - with watches and personal assistants that let you conduct searches of your home or the world with just your voice.\n\nUnder CFO Ruth Porat, who joined the company from Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) in 2015, Alphabet is finally telling investors how much they're spending on \"other bets\" like robots and self-driving cars, and it's working to make money on those ventures.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIt's hard to see a loser here.\n\nThe perceived threat to Alphabet is the growing balkanization of the Internet, with national governments seeking to control what people see and say within their borders, and who can profit from it. That has yet to impact GOOGL, but even the perception can hurt a stock.\n\nAAPL is currently benefiting from a global flight to safety. Its enormous cash position, its strength as a luxury brand, and its growth in services, which could easily be expanded into competition in the cloud with companies such as Alphabet, are all seen in the best light right now.\n\nIf pushed to the wall and forced to buy just one right now, I would probably go with GOOG, the non-voting version of Alphabet stock, which shares equally in earnings but sells at a $20 per share discount to the GOOGL shares.\n\nBut both companies are like General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ) was in the 1950s, International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) was in the 1960s, and Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL ) was in the last decade. These are their good old days.

If Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have their way, home phones could become even more of a rarity.\n\nSource: Amazon\n\nA report in TheWall Street Journal suggests the companies are working on adding voice-calling capabilities to the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers.\n\nThe Plan to Make Amazon Echo Your New Telephone\n\nTheWall Street Journal is reporting that Google and Amazon are looking at an all-new use for their smart speakers: replacing the home telephone .\n\nThe idea makes sense. Telephones increasingly seem like outdated technology. Between smartphones and PC-based calling services like Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Skype, the days of the dedicated home phone seem numbered. In 2015, a survey by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (which, apparently, cares about these things) found that nearly half of American homes had given up their dedicated landline .\n\nBut, that still leaves a lot of telephones in operation.\n\nApparently, it's occurred to both Amazon and Google that smart speakers such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home may be the right device in the right place at the right time. Smart speakers get the name because they leverage an AI-powered personal digital assistant.\n\nAmazon's Echo is home to Alexa, with over 5,000 skills . These devices have the smarts to take on telephone functionality. They could incorporate Skype, for example. And, Google has a slew of its own telephony applications it could leverage, including Google Voice and Duo.\n\nThe Amazon Echo and Google Home are equipped with excellent microphones, they have speakers, they are always connected (to the internet) and they respond instantly to voice commands, even from across a room.\n\nSo, as long as privacy isn't an issue (since using one would be like using a speakerphone), a smart speaker could replace a telephone and save consumers money by eliminating the monthly cost of a landline. While this would be a potentially useful trick for existing smart speaker owners, it's the kind of practical capability that could drive sales among those consumers who wouldn't otherwise consider a high-tech device like the Amazon Echo.\n\nThe Challenges of Turning a Smart Speaker Into a Telephone\n\nWhile the technology and built-in smarts may be there, in reality turning that Amazon Echo on your kitchen counter into your home phone may not be quite that simple.\n\nTheWall Street Journal article lays out some of the challenges. For example, there are potential privacy issues, not only in speaking out loud to the Echo (it lacks an AUX input, so you couldn't physically connect a handset), but the fact that now your telephone would always be listening to you and recording key data like phone numbers and call durations.\n\nAmazon and Google would also have to implement a feature to prevent voice commands from being triggered during a phone conversation.\n\nIt's also been pointed out that switching from a cell phone or landline to an internet-based telephone service has implications for emergency services. For example, the FCC lists a series of limitations to 911 service when home owners rely on internet-based (or VoIP) services.\n\nCalls may not be routed directly to an emergency center, locational information may not be available to emergency responders and, in a power outage, internet telephones go offline without battery backups.\n\nDespite the challenges, The Wall Street Journal says its sources are convinced Amazon and Google will move forward, calling the move to telephone capability \"the logical next step for the artificial intelligence-powered speakers.\" And, that move could happen later this year.\n\nThe question is, knowing that there are some privacy concerns and potential safety issues in doing so, would you ditch your landline and use an Amazon Echo as your home's new telephone?\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Would You Ditch Your Home Phone for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)? appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook has been talking an awful lot lately about augmented reality - or AR. The latest episode was last week, when he compared the technology to the iPhone in terms of its potential to be big.\n\nSource: Nantic\n\nAfter months of repeatedly playing up AR in public, it's beginning to feel as if Cook is setting the expectations of the press and public about the technology.\n\nThat begs the question: Is Apple Inc. planning a major augmented reality announcement?\n\nAR vs. VR: What's the Difference?\n\nAugmented reality is related to virtual reality - or VR - but the two are also very different.\n\nVirtual reality uses technology to completely immerse people in a virtual world. This requires powerful computing hardware and special headgear. VR has spent several years as the next big thing, culminating with Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) buying VR pioneer Oculus for $2 billion in 2014.\n\nVirtual reality hasn't quite caught on in a big way - the expensive and awkward equipment is a big hurdle to overcome - but gamers have begun embracing it.\n\nSo far, Apple has shown no interest in virtual reality and Tim Cook has actually made a point in several interviews of downplaying VR. In the latest, when Cook spoke to The Independent , he laments the fact that virtual reality \"closes the world out.\"\n\n\"Most people don't want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can't do that because you get sick from it.\"\n\nThe antisocial aspects of virtual reality, the equipment requirements and side effects such as motion sickness have been common themes in Cook's argument against virtual reality.\n\nHowever, he is very excited by augmented reality and its ability to go mainstream. Instead of locking a person into a virtual world, AR overlays the existing world with additional information. One of the most popular examples of AR in action is the game Pokemon Go , released last summer. That game was the most downloaded app of 2016 on Apple Inc.'s App Store.\n\nIs Apple Inc. Planning a Major AR Announcement?\n\nTim Cook's views on augmented reality seem to have been getting more positive in the past few months, reaching the point where he's actively hyping the technology. In October, he said :\n\n\"I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you.\"\n\nAnd last week, he told The Independent :\n\n\"I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it's for everyone. I think AR is that big, it's huge.\"\n\nWhat's holding AR back is the technology.\n\nHardware doesn't need to be as powerful as the silicon needed to drive virtual reality gear. And rather than a fully enclosed headpiece or goggles - that themselves are so complex they can cost $600 on top of the PC needed to drive them - augmented reality can be delivered through specialized eyeglasses or on a smartphone's display. The problem is current efforts haven't been quite good enough.\n\nAlphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) failed Google Glass is the best-known example of the AR overlay glasses model, while Pokemon Go shows the relatively primitive AR experience that current smartphones can deliver.\n\nWhat if Tim Cook has been playing up augmented reality (and dissing VR) because Apple Inc. is preparing to make a major push into AR? It could be the company that takes augmented reality mainstream by nailing the hardware, while everyone else is distracted by trying to get consumers to buy into VR.\n\nThere has been speculation that Apple is working with German optics firm Carl Zeiss AG on Apple-branded AR glasses . The iPhone 8 could also incorporate next generation hardware - from cameras to CPU and GPU - that are optimized to make AR a killer feature.\n\nWe'll have to wait until the company is ready to show its hand to know exactly what is up. But based on Tim Cook's continued promotion of the technology, it seems likely that Apple Inc. is priming us for AR-related announcement.\n\nAnd if Cook is even close to being right about augmented reality having the potential to be as big as the iPhone, the upside for Apple stock could be huge.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Apple Inc. (AAPL) Careens Closer to Major AR Announcement appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWe've all heard the argument that it's wrong to trade Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Many prominent experts rage over those who dare to trade around the price action of AAPL stock. It is confusing to investors to figure out who is wrong. Sure, I could spend a few hours parsing data and calculating returns while making assumptions of entry and exit spots. Or, I can accept the fact that they are both right to a degree.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOn the one hand, it is undeniable that owning Apple stock for decades has been a winning proposition. But so was trading around the chop. It comes down to what works for each us individually. Most investors enter positions but get stopped out when things go wrong. So I will refrain from judging which group is smarter.\n\nI found neutral ground using AAPL options. I commit to Apple long-term, especially when it falls out of favor, and leave myself room for error. I do so with no money out of pocket, thereby rendering my risk to a fraction of owning the stock.\n\nLast month, I created $5 per contract out of thin air trading AAPL stock when it had appeared to be too late . Even more recently, I repeated for another $1.2 yield in mere days.\n\nThis strategy is easy to do on equities that are solid and what some would consider sure things like AAPL or Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). I am less easy about doing this with say Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ). With stocks that are perceived to be risky, such as Netflix , I would need to be pickier with my entry and exit points.\n\nToday, I want to repeat performance regardless of which whale bought Apple or who sold it.\n\nHow to Trade AAPL Stock Here\n\nThe Trade - Long AAPL: Sell the AAPL 2018 $105 put for $2.70 to open. The 22% price buffer from current levels translate into a 90% theoretical chance of success. I only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own AAPL stock at the strike sold. Some investors prefer spreading the risk into a credit put spread instead, and that works too.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge I have been a longtime harsh critic of Tim Cook, so I don't count myself as an AAPL bull, but I do know how to do math. Apple's valuation makes sense at $100 or even $200 per share given current conditions. So I do trust selling risk against that fact rather than chase hope that Tim Cook is able to grow the company.\n\nFor now, he has a boulder that is hard to stop, and I can count on buyers to support the price.\n\nI realize that markets are at all-time highs and precariously perched. So I could buy sacrifice puts in AAPL stock to guard against a market crash. For example, I could spend 20 cents buying the AAPL Jun $100 put to limit my loss if we fall off a cliff in the next four months.\n\nI am not required to hold my trades through expiration. I can close it for partial gains or losses at any time.\n\nNicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com .

I Have the Answer! appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Want to put Fidelity Investments' world-class research resources to work for your retirement accounts and your taxable portfolios? Of course you do.\n\nKnowing how the Boston-based asset management giant has deployed the assets of shareholders in its stock mutual funds and balanced funds can help you make decisions about your own buys and sells.\n\nFor example, in the fourth quarter Fidelity trimmed its exposure to several big technology bellwether stocks. Not all Fidelity funds may act in lockstep, but overall the fund complex lightened its net share count in Facebook ( FB ) by 5.1%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research for CFRA, an independent research firm.\n\nFacebook is ranked No. 4 on IBD's Internet-Content industry group, thanks in part to a strong 91 Composite Rating from IBD and 87% average earnings per share growth over the past three quarters. 99 is the highest possible rating, which is on a scale from 1-99.\n\n[ibdchart symbol=\"fb\" type=\"daily\" size=\"threequarter\" position=\"leftchart\" ]\n\nFidelity's Facebook holding is now at its lightest quarter-end level since the end of 2013, Rosenbluth says in a new report for MarketScope Advisor.\n\nFacebook has rallied 16% since the beginning in a year to an all-time high. Subsequent disclosures by Fidelity will reveal whether it's been a buyer of Facebook shares in the current period.\n\nThe fund complex also trimmed its net share count in Google-owner Alphabet's C-class shares ( GOOG ) by 5.6% and its A-class shares ( GOOGL ) by 1.4%. Alphabet has rallied 6% so far this year. It faded after clearing the 816.78 buy point of a flat base on Jan. 23. It's retaken the buy point.\n\nGraphics chipmaker Nvidia ( NVDA ) was a third tech big name to be trimmed by Fidelity. Fidelity also trimmed Salesforce.com ( CRM ), a provider of customer relationship management software.\n\nIBD'S TAKE:Nvidia ranks No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, buoyed by a solid-gold 99 Comp Rating and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration. For details, check the stock's vital signs at IBD's Stock Checkup .\n\nStill, tech remained Fidelity's biggest sector, accounting for 26% of the fund family's shareholders' money. That was an increase from Sept. 30's 24% and June 30's 23% weighting.\n\nAnd many Fidelity funds, including some of its largest, remained owners of stock in which the overall complex made net trims.\n\nFor instance, now-$35.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) held Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and Salesforce.com in its top 10 at year-end.\n\nTech-Sector Buys\n\nAnd there were several tech names in which Fidelity made net increases in its share counts during Q4.\n\nFidelity boosted its share count in software giant Microsoft (MSFT) by 9.3% to 148 million shares. That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.\n\nThat was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.\n\n\"A few other stocks that had double-digit percentage share increases include Autodesk (ADSK),\" Rosenbluth told IBD, referring to the developer of computer-aided design software applications.\n\nFinancials\n\nFinancials were Fidelity's second-largest sector, with 15% of shareholders' assets. That increase took place as Fidelity increased its exposure to some big U.S. banks.\n\nBank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) all saw double-digit percentage share count growth, Rosenbluth wrote. He added, \"CFRA thinks investor optimism for banks improved amid expectations for higher interest rates and regulatory reform.\"\n\nPresident Trump and Congress are widely expected to lighten the regulatory restrictions on some banks.\n\nIn addition, Fidelity made a double-digit percentage increase in its share count in Capital One Financial (COF).\n\nThe $414.3 million Fidelity Blue Chip Value (FBCVX) held Alphabet, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in its top 10 at year end.\n\nIndustrials\n\nFidelity had a 9% weight in industrials as of the end of Q4. Fidelity managers made a 53% net addition to their share count in aerospace and defense contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) in the quarter. They added 6.7% to their shares in General Electric (GE).\n\nTelecommunications\n\nComcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ) were two stocks in which Fidelity managers made double-digit share increases.\n\nTech was not the only space in which Fidelity funds made cuts. Fidelity managers made double-digit decreases to telecom titan AT&T (T), energy explorer and producer Chevron (CVX), medical products maker Medtronic (MDT) and to athletic apparel, footwear and equipment maker Nike (NKE).\n\nEach of those decreases appears vindicated at this early point following the quarter. Comp Ratings for each of those stocks current range from an anemic 27 for Chevron to Nike's 59.\n\nAll of Rosenbluth's data applies to Fidelity's 232 stock and balanced funds (mixtures of stocks and bonds), which together hold nearly $1 trillion in shareholder assets, according to Morningtstar Inc.\n\nFidelity runs an additional 70 funds that hold bonds or commodities, accounting for an additional $233 billion in shareholder money.\n\nRELATED:\n\nP-s-s-st!

He succeeds Craig Barratt, who stepped down in October 2016.\n\nHowever, the latest job cuts will reportedly affect more workers than the October layoffs. Several hundred Access employees are said to be moving to new jobs at Google or other Alphabet companies.\n\nLast August, the Wall Street Journal reported that Alphabet is rethinking its high-speed internet business after initial rollouts proved more expensive and time consuming than anticipated.\n\nGoogle's announcement in 2010 of its Fiber project sparked high expectations at a time when telephone companies were perceived as moving slowly in rolling out faster broadband service.

Fidelity also trimmed Salesforce.com ( CRM ), a provider of customer relationship management software.\n\nIBD'S TAKE: Nvidia ranks No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, buoyed by a solid-gold 99 Comp Rating and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration. For details, check the stock's vital signs at IBD's Stock Checkup .\n\nStill, tech remained Fidelity's biggest sector, accounting for 26% of the fund family's shareholders' money. That was an increase from Sept. 30's 24% and June 30's 23% weighting.\n\nAnd many Fidelity funds, including some of its largest, remained owners of stock in which the overall complex made net trims.\n\nFor instance, now-$35.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) held Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and Salesforce.com in its top 10 at year-end.\n\nTech-Sector Buys\n\nAnd there were several tech names in which Fidelity made net increases in its share counts during Q4.\n\nFidelity boosted its share count in software giant Microsoft (MSFT) by 9.3% to 148 million shares. That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.\n\nThat was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.\n\n\"A few other stocks that had double-digit percentage share increases include Autodesk (ADSK),\" Rosenbluth told IBD, referring to the developer of computer-aided design software applications.\n\nFinancials\n\nFinancials were Fidelity's second-largest sector, with 15% of shareholders' assets. That increase took place as Fidelity increased its exposure to some big U.S. banks.\n\nBank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) all saw double-digit percentage share count growth, Rosenbluth wrote. He added, \"CFRA thinks investor optimism for banks improved amid expectations for higher interest rates and regulatory reform.\"\n\nPresident Trump and Congress are widely expected to lighten the regulatory restrictions on some banks.\n\nIn addition, Fidelity made a double-digit percentage increase in its share count in Capital One Financial (COF).\n\nThe $414.3 million Fidelity Blue Chip Value (FBCVX) held Alphabet, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in its top 10 at year end.\n\nIndustrials\n\nFidelity had a 9% weight in industrials as of the end of Q4. Fidelity managers made a 53% net addition to their share count in aerospace and defense contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) in the quarter. They added 6.7% to their shares in General Electric (GE).\n\nTelecommunications\n\nComcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ) were two stocks in which Fidelity managers made double-digit share increases.\n\nTech was not the only space in which Fidelity funds made cuts. Fidelity managers made double-digit decreases to telecom titan AT&T (T), energy explorer and producer Chevron (CVX), medical products maker Medtronic (MDT) and to athletic apparel, footwear and equipment maker Nike (NKE).\n\nEach of those decreases appears vindicated at this early point following the quarter. Comp Ratings for each of those stocks current range from an anemic 27 for Chevron to Nike's 59.\n\nAll of Rosenbluth's data applies to Fidelity's 232 stock and balanced funds (mixtures of stocks and bonds), which together hold nearly $1 trillion in shareholder assets, according to Morningtstar Inc.\n\nFidelity runs an additional 70 funds that hold bonds or commodities, accounting for an additional $233 billion in shareholder money.\n\nRELATED:\n\nP-s-s-st! Here's What Fidelity Has Been Buying And Selling", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNot long ago, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) perfected the art of the big reveal. New Apple product announcements would be shrouded in mystery for weeks, and then the late Steve Jobs would get up on a stage and wow consumers and investors alike with the first-ever iPhone, the first-ever iPad or the first-ever iPod. AAPL stock would get an automatic 10% to 15% bump in the days that followed. Could Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) have a similarly secretive catalyst in its so-called Windows Cloud product?\n\nSource: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)\n\nWindows Cloud is a mysterious operating system that was revealed via leaks, prompting a \"nothing to share\" response from Microsoft last week.\n\nWhat Is the Windows Cloud?\n\nA couple websites posted screen shots of Microsoft's yet-to-be-announced operating system, which would only run Windows Store apps designed to run on both desktop computers and mobile devices. The thought is that the Windows Cloud would supplement, not replace, the company's Windows 10 platform, which is only 18 months old.\n\nThe Windows Cloud is already being viewed as Microsoft's answer to Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Chrome OS. And by utilizing only its own apps, the platform could have a security advantage over Chrome, which uses non-native apps. That could position Windows 10 as a more appealing option to public institutions like schools, where protecting students' computers from outside apps or games can be difficult.\n\nNot much else is known about the Windows Cloud platform. And that's probably how Microsoft likes it. Although Wall Street didn't immediately embrace the top-secret new product by snatching up MSFT stock in droves, the real test will be when the company actually does its big Windows Cloud reveal. Will the platform impress enough to have an AAPL-like effect on Microsoft stock?\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nFirst, let's look at how MSFT stock has been behaving lately.\n\nThere was big spike in MSFT stock last month has since been followed by a sharp retreat; however, the stock is still hovering above its 25- and 50-day moving averages, as well as two-month support in the $62-range.\n\nWhat you don't see is any kind of Microsoft stock price movement in the days since the Windows Cloud leak occurred. That means investors aren't quite sure exactly what the Windows Cloud is and how it could affect MSFT's business, which is why there has been no sudden rush to buy MSFT.\n\nIf more details leak out, that could potentially move the needle. For now, though, the Windows Cloud remains a relative mystery that likely has Wall Street more confused than excited.\n\nMSFT Stock Is Strong Even Without the 'Cloud'\n\nIn the meantime, Microsoft looks good on its own merits. MSFT stock is up nearly 30% in the last year, nearly 50% in the last two years, still trades at less than 20 times forward earnings estimates, and is expected to grow earnings-per-share by more than 6% this year and more than 9% next year. Sprinkle in a potential game changer in the Windows Cloud, and there's no reason to suspect Microsoft stock is going to suddenly backtrack.\n\nOn the contrary, the recent mini-dip is a prime buying opportunity, so long as it holds above those short-term moving averages. I'd buy MSFT stock right here, with the hope that a future Windows Cloud unveiling could spark a quick run-up the way Apple's secret product launches used to.\n\nAs of this writing, Chris Fraley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Win Big With 'Windows Cloud' appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAll too much like James Cameron's 2009 sci-fi flick Avatar , just when you think the feud between Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL ) is over, you find out it's not.* Last week, the iconic database company told the iconic search engine company it was appealing a ruling made against Oracle - in favor of Alphabet - in May of last year.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFor better or worse, GOOGL stock owners either didn't hear, or didn't care. If it's the latter, it's not terribly surprising. The company formerly known as Google is sued on a regular basis, often by parties with weak cases just looking for a payday.\n\nGOOGL shareholders may want to take a closer look this time around though. While successful appeal cases are tough, Oracle's argument holds slightly more water than the typical long-shot case like the one Vringo levied (and ultimately lost) back in 2014 . Moreover, the case itself could have significant repercussions for other outfits in the heat of similar arguments about open source software.\n\nGOOGL: Here We Go Again\n\nWarning: You may need to read through the intricacies of this case twice to fully understand what's going on, and even then, there's no guarantee it will make complete sense. Here's the crux of the argument though … Oracle says Alphabet used a little too much of its Java software - which is free, open-source software - in its Android operating system.\n\nThe suit largely hinges on what constitutes \"fair use\" of open-source and freely-available software.\n\nWhile Oracle offers Java for any consumer to download and any developer to utilize pieces of, the company contends it was never intended for wide swaths of the code to be cut and pasted and utilized as part of a commercial, revenue-bearing system. The complaint specifically read :\n\n\"The undisputed evidence showed that Google verbatim copied the heart of Oracle's creative work for an entirely commercial purpose without any change to Oracle's expressive content or message, took far more than necessary to program in the Java language, and, in so doing, harmed the market for Java.\"\n\nThe strength of Oracle's copyrights on its application programming interfaces, or APIs, was particularly emphasized by the company in the prior jury trial.\n\nAlphabet's counterargument is simpler - CEO Larry Page said , \"We didn't pay for the free and open things.\"\n\nIf all of this rings a bell with GOOGL stock owners, there's a reason. This argument has been waged in a courtroom a few times, going back as far as 2010. The current stage for this battle of the titans is an appeal of last year's loss suffered by Oracle. That case's loss likely saved Alphabet Inc from being forced to pay the $9 billion in damages Oracle was seeking.\n\nBottom Line for GOOGL Stock, and Others\n\nOwners of GOOGL stock don't have a great deal to worry about here. The courts sided with the company in the most recent case, and appeals - a reversal of a prior judgment - are very difficult win.\n\nThe case, though, will have far-reaching consequences beyond the Alphabet/Oracle tiff. In essence, this contest could largely help affirm just how \"open\" open source code really is even if its user ends up commercializing it as Alphabet did with Java via Android. Perhaps in a bigger sense though, this trial will once again serve as an indictment on decency (or lack thereof) and common sense (or, again, lack thereof).\n\nWhile not a legal matter raised during any of the lawsuits' arguments, all juror's minds were apt to be asking themselves why Oracle would offer Java in part or in whole for free - even for commercial uses - if it didn't want it to be used this extensively.\n\nAnother relevant but unasked question is why Java's original developer, Sun Microsystems, supported Android's use of the platform before Oracle acquired Sun, but Oracle switched gears on the stance after buying Sun Microsystems. And, perhaps if Oracle had been more clear about how its rampant use of it in the Android OS had \"harmed the market for Java\" when it's not really otherwise monetized, a judge and jury could have been a little more sympathetic.\n\nAs it stands though, the Oracle argument looks to be founded more on regret and frustration and less on merits. The courts so far seem to be picking up on that.\n\nBroadly speaking, it all bodes well for other entities that have somehow commercialized open source software and APIs.\n\n* Avatar, while a stunningly successful film, was a three hour epic, and could have easily ended at two points in the film before the third (and actual) ending.\n\nAs of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Holders Shouldn't Worry About Oracle appeared first on InvestorPlace ." ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4751680943170304, 0.4328479437229437, 0.5288561076604554, 0.3343125701459034, 0.3449813928761298, 0.4189726533628973, 0.4016899766899767, 0.3343125701459034, 0.4633631482896188, 0.4629248066748067 ], "headline" : [ "Would You Ditch Your Home Phone for Amazon.com, Inc.

After all, Trump would frequently go onto the site to announce new plans or fight back against his detractors. It was (and continues to be) an incredible resource for political updates.\n\nNow that Trump is President, his tweets move markets. His attacks on companies can send share prices lower in a heartbeat and are an important thing to consider for investors these days. Some have set up apps to track his tweets and how they relate to the market. Others do a tweet analysis in order to get better insight into the mind of the President, including The Atlantic'sTrump Tweet Tracker .\n\nBut beyond Trump, Twitter also managed to become the single greatest collection of primary sources of all-time. When breaking news happens, it is almost always reported first hand on Twitter, and then it is disseminated out from there.\n\nYou'd think that these factors alone would make Twitter an unstoppable media juggernaut. A must for journalists and those seeking to stay up-to-date on the news alike. So how has Twitter capitalized on this incredible timing and presidential stroke of luck? Well, in short, it hasn't.\n\nBad Earnings Report Again\n\nThe company posted yet another disappointing quarter for Q4, missing expectations on the revenue front and posting shockingly poor active user figures. It remains stuck around the 320 million active monthly user mark, and can't even seem to grow revenues either. Add in disappointing adjusted earnings guidance, and it isn't a great situation by any stretch for TWTR investors these days, especially given that the company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nAnd let's remember, these figures are with the leader of the free world literally using the service to clarify policy and goals on a regular basis. The environment cannot possibly get any better for Twitter. Its product is in the news on a near hourly basis at this point and it still can't find a way to get the job done.\n\nClearly, Twitter needs a shakeup and it needs a bit of a Hail-Mary in order to get back into investors' good graces. So, what can the company do?\n\nTwitter Needs to Copy YouTube. Now.\n\nFortunately for Twitter, the path to relevancy and growth is already laid out before them. The good folks at Alphabet ( GOOGL) ( GOOG) have already done all the hard work in their YouTube division and Twitter needs only to copy their best practices.\n\nFirst and foremost is capitalizing on the incredible missed opportunity of getting an ad right on to tweets. As you can see in the picture below, there is always a big white box at the bottom right hand corner of each tweet.\n\nWhy not fill that with a small advertisement? Sure, some people are not going to like that, but people will adjust accordingly. We saw something similar with YouTube where at first only certain videos had ads, and now nearly everything has an advertisement before the video. People have adapted and it has become the norm to see this before a video. People will do the same with Twitter (and embedded tweets) and this will help with casual users (much the same way embedding helped with casual YouTubers).\n\nAfter all, these casual users who mostly see tweets embedded somewhere else make up a huge base of people and are arguably the key to Twitter's success. Finding a way to make money off these people-much like how YouTube doesn't need you to be signed in or making videos to make revenue off of you-should be paramount in Twitter's near term plans.\n\nAccording to Twitter, embedded tweets reach more than a billion people each month across the web, a truly massive figure. And that number is actually from before Donald Trump burst onto the scene and tweets were on the nightly news on a regular basis.\n\nBut what if people hate this idea and recoil from the service? Well, an easy way to placate people will be to pay the content generators for the work they are doing. Giving tweeters a slice of the ad revenue that they generate would go a long way to getting people and small businesses to tweet more, and it is pretty much akin to what YouTube does with their stars. And Twitter has even looked to do this on the video side , so why not extend it over to their bread and butter anyway?\n\nBottom Line\n\nAre some of these ideas going to be popular? Definitely not. But Twitter needs to try something in order to jumpstart its floundering share price and lackluster growth. Everything needs to be on the table, and now is the time to do it.\n\nThe company finds itself in a truly historic position and it is an opportunity that isn't going to come around every four years. The confluence of Trump and the increased desire for real-time (and unfiltered) news from around the globe should be a godsend for Twitter, but the company has completely failed to capitalize on the trend.\n\nTaking some of YouTube's best practices might be a good place to start in order to return to relevancy though. It certainly has a better shot of reviving the stock than anything Twitter has come up with recently, and it could push TWTR back towards growth too.\n\nAnd a position of growth would make Twitter a much better candidate for a takeover, perhaps from a company like Alphabet. Such a partnership makes a lot of sense and it would allow better integration between Google search results and tweets, while the melding of tweets and YouTube comments would be a great match as well.\n\nSo, if Twitter wants to get to this end-which seems like the best possible outcome for TWTR investors at this point-take a page out of YouTube's book and start thinking about ways to get more ads out there, and how to benefit creators in the process. Because if Twitter can't take some risks and find a way to make things work when their service is at the forefront of news and popular culture like it is now, they never will.\n\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\n\nZacks' free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

It's Friday, Jan. 27, and we're breaking them quarterly results from PayPal and Alphabet. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined in the studio by fool.com tech editor Sarah Priestley. Sarah, how's it going?\n\nSarah Priestley: It's good, it's a pleasure to be here, thank you for having me.\n\nLewis: Are you excited for pizza day?\n\nPriestley: I am very excited. It's going to derail my New Year's resolutions, but that's OK. [laughs]\n\nLewis: That's a callback to your episode with the Vincent Shen. Are you finding that the Apple Watch is being helpful?\n\nPriestley: Yes. It's definitely reminding me at 9 p.m. that I have done 0 steps, so I just end up walking around my living room like a crazy person.\n\nLewis: I do that when I'm on the phone all the time. That's how I get my exercise in.\n\nPriestley: That's probably a good idea, yeah.\n\nLewis: So, Sarah, a ton going on in tech this week, the next couple weeks with earnings. Two pretty followed Fool companies reported yesterday after the bell. We dug into the reports and are ready to talk about them. You did some of the heavy lifting with PayPal; I dug into Alphabet. Why don't we talk about PayPal first. How did the results look?\n\nPriestley: To give you an overview for the fourth quarter, earnings came in at $0.42 per share. $2.9 billion in revenue. Operating revenue was a little higher than expected at 21%. Transactions were $1.8 billion. But the volume was below expected. Expected was $100 billion and they delivered $99.3 billion. And that is why share prices are down about 3.5% this morning. So, it seems like a slight overreaction when you dig into their numbers. But, yeah, that's the reason for the share price falling.\n\nLewis: And that's really one of the core metrics that investors tend to focus on for them as a company, right?\n\nPriestley: Absolutely. They really are measured on engagement, so number of customers, and engagement of those customers, and the key metrics for those.\n\nLewis: Looking beyond some of the top line numbers, what else popped up to you in the report?\n\nPriestley: The operating margin for the fourth quarter was down to 15.4%. The reason that we're commenting on this is that that's a lot, it takes up a lot of room in the bullish theses, that the new partnerships they've started with a lot of the banks, Visa , Mastercard , they're going to really pressure their margins down.\n\nLewis: Is the thought there that they're working with very big institutions and big players, and they just don't have the negotiating room that they might with some smaller players?\n\nPriestley: Absolutely. That's part of it. And also, it's just the standard transaction payment. It's the same thing for Square and other payment processors; it's a standard transaction amount on card processing. So, that 15.4% compared to 16.1% in the fourth quarter of last year -- you can see, that's quite a decline there. Management has talked about the fact that they are really doing everything they can to leverage their other income against this. And I feel like they've done a pretty good job. Their CEO, Dan Schulman, has said that they won't be a slave to quarter-to-quarter margin performance.\n\nLewis: Which is something we like to hear as Foolish investors.\n\nPriestley: That's very true. And, I would also comment that the management team is really being driven for their compensation package on the long-term performance of this stock, and I think that really shows in their reporting. They're focused on free cash flow in their projects, and what they're delivering to their customers. Just to give you a couple of the year-over-year figures: Earnings per share for the year increased 15% to $1.15. Non-GAAP was $1.50 on guidance of $1.45 to $1.50. That's pretty good. Revenue for the full year was up 17%, and 21% on a currency-neutral basis, and they guided for 19%, so they really beat that.\n\nLewis: Like Alphabet, their fiscal Q4 comes with the calendar Q4, so we were able to look at full year results here, and not just the quarterly results. What's going on with total payment volume? I know that's something that people really like to focus on with them.\n\nPriestley: Yeah, absolutely. If we had seen total payment volume less than 25%, I think we would have seen a bigger decline in the stock price. Luckily, for the fourth quarter, payment volume was up 25%. As I said, the actual processed amount was $99.3 billion, which missed the expectations. Interestingly, the majority of this was pushed by international. International expanded 27%. The U.S. was 23%.\n\nLewis: And for the unacquainted, total payment volume is just the gross amount that they are helping to facilitate.\n\nPriestley: Yes. The way to look at this is, the total payment volume is the number of payments that they process. Then, the transaction is the amount that they process. So, they're averaging about $56 per transaction right now. That's slightly down from $60 that they were averaging a couple quarters ago. But it's still very good.\n\nLewis: So, for the amount per transaction to be down, they must be doing more total transactions to be making it up in volume and still be seeing growth, right?\n\nPriestley: Yes, you're exactly right. I will also comment that, of their transactions in their Q4, $100 billion was mobile payments, which is an increase of 55%, and it's almost a third now of their transactions processed. Which is fantastic, and I think the management team has really isolated that as an opportunity for the company. That's where they're going to really demonstrate their industry leadership. The market is moving toward mobile, and they're really pioneering in the mobile industry.\n\nLewis: So what can people expect looking forward, either first quarter of 2017 or further out, broadly in 2017?\n\nPriestley: Absolutely. I'll look for 2017 quarter four revenue we're expecting to grow on a currency neutral basis 16% to 18%. That gives you a range of $2.9 billion to $2.95 billion. That was actually slightly more conservative than some analysts were expecting, which played into their share price performance today. But full-year performance is strong, revenue growth 15% to 17% and 17% to 19% currency neutral, which gives you about $12.45 billion to $12.65 billion.\n\nLewis: Is there anything to worry about with some of these numbers that we're looking at, that management growth projections are different than what the market is expecting? Because, they are still very much in growth mode as a business, and I know that early on, those projections, if they start to decelerate at all, can start to scare people off a little bit.\n\nPriestley: I think they have been fairly conservative in some of their estimations, because they really do have a huge potential with the mobile traffic. I think, if you look at some of their projects that they're working on now, Venmo has increased 100% year over year. It was Time Magazine's best app, it's processed $5.6 billion, which was up 126%. So, I think they have a huge potential with a lot of the projects they're working on; they've experienced huge growth. The problem with these is that they are not monetized yet. And an analyst actually raised the question in the earnings call: \"Is your projection in 2017 building in some of the expectations for monetizing this, and also Xoom?\" which is their international money transfer program. They dismissed this. They said it was pushing out to 2018, some of the opportunities, and that they will be focused on growth. So, I think, for 2017, these might be conservative estimates. But for 2018, we might actually start to see the fruits of that labor.\n\nLewis: Yeah, and you said, 55% of what was being processed, broadly for the business, was coming from mobile. When you look at Venmo specifically, that is almost entirely mobile. It's more peer-to-peer. There are some questions about whether or not they will be able to monetize that very well, and what that might look like, because me giving you $5 because you bought me lunch the other day, they don't really take anything on that.\n\nPriestley: No, they don't. And something to say is, it's becoming a hugely crowded market. I think PayPal, to some degree, has a first-mover advantage, but they're definitely not the biggest player in this industry. The banks have gotten together and created clearXchange, which is a peer-to-peer payment which is also free right now. It's owned by the banks, so it has a lot of clout. Whether or not people pick it up to the rate that they've picked up Venmo, which is hugely popular with millennials, a lot of our friends use it all the time, we use it. Also, Apple . Apple has grown hugely. Tim Cook in his last earnings call -- so, this is a bit outdated -- said that 75% of swiping transactions were from Apple Pay.\n\nLewis: Wow. It's hard to believe. Anecdotally, though, when I'm out with my friends, and maybe you can lend some color on this too, if someone covers the tab, I'm paying them via Venmo. No one is ever like, \"Do you have Bank of America mobile payment processing?\" So, they do seem to have that first-mover advantage, and I think they have that name recognition. When you have that huge installed base, as they do, it really comes down to whether they can flip the monetization switch on. I guess investors are going to have to be patient on that, if management is pushing that out to 2018.\n\nPriestley: Absolutely. I will say, they do have a lot of initiatives that are panning out for them right now. One Touch basically enables you to fill in your bank details, and you work through PayPal, and you can just click one button at the checkout and it's transacted through PayPal, which is hugely beneficial for mobile. I don't know about you, but frequently, when I'm looking at shoes online, as soon as I get to the card payment, and you have to zoom in on those small boxes and put your card numbers in, they lose me. I think it's something like a 74% cart-abandonment rate on mobile.\n\nLewis: So when people reach that checkout phase and they see that they need to drop in their credit card number, their security code, their address, shipping address, zip code, all that stuff, they wind up ditching it?\n\nPriestley: Absolutely. But, PayPal One Touch, they have 87% conversion rate on mobile. That's incredible. They've had a lot of people starting to use that. They have added a lot of One Touch users. And, I think, of their merchants, about one-third right now are on One Touch. And they just launched this last year. So there's a huge potential here for them to really deliver on their promise. They've said they want to make customers' lives easier, and they're doing that, absolutely.\n\nLewis: Anything else that management provided color on with the business, and strategically where they're looking, that investors should know?\n\nPriestley: I think the focus is absolutely on mobile. Dan Schulman has definitely commented on the fact that mobile is the biggest opportunity for them, and there are a lot of industry tailwinds that they're experiencing right now. And I would completely agree. I think Black Friday this year was the biggest online shopping day in history. In quarter three last year -- we're still waiting for quarter four -- the Census Bureau said that online retail made up 10% of all retail transactions. So you can see that if they are positioning themselves well to benefit from this, it should be a rising tide that lifts all boats.\n\nLewis: I know they've talked a little bit in the past about continuing to be an asset-light business. Is that something that management recommitted to in the most recent call?\n\nPriestley: Yeah, absolutely. This is something that analysts have been focusing on. I definitely noticed a couple of questions about this in the earnings call. Square offers capital, it offers loans, as part of its services. It's not a huge part of their business, but it is a risk area of the business. So, in the fourth quarter, they had $123 million loss on loans. As a service similar to the company Square, which deals mostly with small businesses, but obviously this is individuals, PayPal has access to a lot of people's information and their spending habits and how much money they have. So they want to really leverage that information, and offer it out to partners to facilitate the loans using their information, which takes the risk away from PayPal, but they're still generating a percentage of income from it. So, overall, Dan Schulman commented that it's a really competitive environment for this. I think the payment space is just getting more and more competitive, every angle of it. But overall, I think this is definitely a good move for the company. It's the right decision, it's going to eliminate some risk. But it's also potentially going to bring in a degree of revenue too, if they can grow that segment.\n\nLewis: So, it seems like the general takeaway here is: Wait and see with a lot of the company's mobile initiatives. The core business seems to be humming along. There was a little bit of disappointment, but nothing thesis-altering, nothing crazy in the report.\n\nPriestley: No, absolutely not. And they didn't touch too much on some of their partners. They've had some really high-profile partnerships with Alibaba , Vodafone in the U.K. and Europe, and many others; Discover , that they recently announced. They didn't touch on that too much, so we can't really give investors a good flavor for how that's going, only that it's in line with their expectations. So, yeah, I agree with what you said. I think mobile is going to be a big area of focus, we'll continue to have a look at those transaction volumes and customer engagement.\n\nLewis: So Sarah, I said that you did the heavy lifting on PayPal. I did most of the homework with Alphabet's earnings. I'm going to flip it over to you and let you host for the second half of the show.\n\nPriestley: It's really nice to not be in the hot seat. [laughs]\n\nLewis: Yeah. I'll stop firing questions at you. It's my turn.\n\nPriestley: So, yeah, Alphabet reported the same time, yesterday after the bell. What were the results?\n\nLewis: Overall, Alphabet's revenue came in at about $26.1 billion for Q4, up 22% year over year, which beat analysts' estimates of $25.3 billion. Earnings per share came in at $7.56, slightly lower than analysts' projections of $7.63 per share. I think the real story -- and what caused some of the immediate reaction for the stock -- was that adjusted profit missed by much more. That came in at $9.36 a share, versus expectations of $9.64 a share. We saw, after hours, the stock was down about 2.5% to 3%. That's what most of the market seemed to really fixate on.\n\nPriestley: And what was the cause of that?\n\nLewis: Tax rate, basically, is the short of it. In Q4, Alphabet had an effective tax rate of 22%. They also highlighted their broad 2016 tax rate, because they're able to report whole fiscal year results as well. The company's effective tax rate for the year was 19%. That's a big bump. And you realize that average is also incorporating other quarters. You can get a sense of how much more they were paying out in taxes this quarter. Really, if you want to get down to the nitty-gritty, MarketWatch writer Jeremy Owen does a really good job breaking down the specifics, but the gist of the issue is, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued some changes a while back, basically impacting how companies can treat stock-based compensation for their adjusted earnings numbers. And that wound up impacting results for this quarter. Moving forward, the company will no longer be excluding stock-based compensation expenses from their non-GAAP results, which should smooth things out. But they wound up dealing with a little bit of a hiccup this quarter to reconcile.\n\nPriestley: Yeah, that's really unusual, the change for GAAP there.\n\nLewis: Yeah. Typically, you think of non-GAAP numbers as being something where the Financial Accounting Standards Board gives people a decent amount of latitude to operate how they want to. But they like to rein things in every now and then, specifically with stock-based compensation because it's something that a lot of firms use to make their non-GAAP numbers look quite a bit better than their GAAP numbers, especially in the tech space. Looking at a couple of the different segments, their Google segment, which is search, ads, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, pretty much anything that falls under their internet properties, came in at $25.8 billion. So, looking at a company with $26 billion in quarterly revenue, that's the meat of it right there. That is generally performing pretty well. Their Google Sites segment, which is the majority of that, was up 20% year over year. Network revenue up 7% year over year. Other revenue, which is a smaller portion a little bit less related to the internet properties within that segment -- think Hardware, Google Play, and their cloud segment -- was $3.4 billion, which was up 62% year over year. So, that's a very fast-growing segment within Sundar Pichai's Google area of the business.\n\nI think, if you're looking for indicators for them, the two big ones that tell the story for the ad business and what's going on with some of the internet properties: Aggregate paid clicks, which is basically the number of times that people are interacting with ads online, was up 36% year over year. Aggregate cost per click, or CPCs, as they're commonly known, was down 15% year over year. This is not really a surprise. This is a story that's been playing out for a long time. We talked about the shift to mobile when we were talking about PayPal. The same thing is happening with internet search. CPCs have been driven down because the effectiveness of mobile ads isn't necessarily quite the same as it is for desktop. But for the longest time, Google has been able to make it up on volume. There's actually quite a parallel there with what happened with PayPal and the volume making up for the smaller transactions. We're seeing the same effects here with Alphabet.\n\nPriestley: Would you suggest that's something that investors should include in their thesis going forward?\n\nLewis: I think it's something that, at this point, we shouldn't be too surprised by. This story has been playing out for a decent amount of time. If it really accelerates, you might have to worry. But they have been very good at making the volume make it work out. Eventually, mobile will need to find a floor somewhere, and enjoy that. But so long as we're still in that transition to mobile, I think we're going to continue to see this for a while, unfortunately.\n\nPriestley: OK. What about the Other Bets segment? I know there have been some interesting moves this year.\n\nLewis: Yeah, this is something that people love to ask about, because it's like, \"Where is Google wasting all of this money?\" As a reminder, this is basically all the stuff they do that isn't tied to their internet properties. Think of it as their moonshot projects. The big financial contributors for this segment are Nest, Fiber, and Verily. They tend to focus on a full-year breakout for the segment because the numbers are so small relative to the overall business. But revenue came in at $809 million for 2016, which was up 82% year over year. Operating loss not including stock-based compensation was $2.9 billion, down slightly year over year. But, this segment is still a money pit for Alphabet, and I think it will continue to be. They have reined in costs a little bit under CFO Ruth Porat. I think she has forced all of the Other Bets initiatives to at least be able to show a path to monetization, or a road map to what that might look like. But I think there's a certain test-and-innovate atmosphere that they want to maintain. And investors have been OK with that, because their core internet business just prints money for them.\n\nSomething that is interesting with them and the Other Bets segment is, they spun out Waymo, which is their autonomous driving segment. For the longest time, that was the Google Self-Driving Car Project. A couple months ago, they said, \"This is a stand-alone business unit, and it will be nested within the Alphabet holding structure. It will continue to be in Other Bets.\" And we didn't get any financial insight into what's going on with that. But they talked about it in the call. Ruth Porat provided some commentary on what they're basically doing with Waymo as a blueprint for what they will continue to be doing with Other Bets. Not a ton to report there, but this is something that Daniel Sparks and I talked about in a podcast when they announced that a few months ago. As we, in the next couple quarters, over the next year, continue to get more information about Waymo, I think we can look at that specific business segment and see the path for what's going to be going on for some of the Other Bets as they continue to mature and eventually see monetization. So, not a ton to report with Other Bets stuff, but at least we have something that we can start to track for what the company's ambitions might be.\n\nPriestley: Absolutely. It looks like they're moving forward with that. Was there anything else in the numbers that stood out to you in the earnings call?\n\nLewis: I think some of the things that people need to keep in mind with this report, because the stock was down after hours, I think as of taping this morning, they were down 40 or 50 basis points, so not a crazy reaction like 3% that we saw after hours yesterday, but still down, I think people might be scratching their heads a little bit with some of the tax stuff they saw. Prior to the report, the company was trading at all-time highs. It's traded up for a while. I think it's somewhere in the teens in the last year or so. So, there's that. And also, Alphabet does not provide detailed quarterly guidance. Most companies do offer up that guidance, and analysts create their own models based on those numbers, those line items, and they have their puts and takes to tweak it slightly. But because Alphabet doesn't give those baseline expectations, the likelihood of actual numbers being different than analysts expectations is slightly higher than it would be for other companies. So, the market's reaction is always, I think, generally going to be a little bit sharper than what we might see for a company that does offer standard guidance.\n\nPriestley: Yeah, because they have nothing ready to peg their estimates to.\n\nLewis: Yeah. They have the general trend of things and what they can glean from commentary. But very often, you'll see analysts' expectations more or less mirror guidance with slight adjustments. Not having that as a crutch can just add some unpredictability to things. I think that's the way you have to think about it.\n\nPriestley: Any other little gems?\n\nLewis: Outside of the numbers, something that caught my eye that I think is a great point, and really underscores the importance of reading company conference calls, and not just relying on the numbers that you see reported and the quick earnings takes you'll see online: Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets in the Q&A section of the call asked this really great question, and I think it points to a looming risk for Alphabet, and I just want to highlight that for listeners. He said, \"It looks to me like Google devices are being outsold 10 to 1 or something like that in most homes. It's immaterial now, but you could see you in five years there's a new voice search interaction interface and it's not Google in the home. That could be a real challenge for the company.\" And he was basically positing, \"What are you guys doing about all of the virtual-assistant and smart-home devices?\"\n\nPriestley: Yeah, great question.\n\nLewis: Yeah. And Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, he gave that generally positive answer, talking about the investments the company is making and how they're working toward voice search, and how they're trying to meet consumers in every situation that they might be using voice search, whether it be phones, TV, homes, cars, whatever. But really, at its core, Mahaney's question is getting at this idea of: Amazon's Echo devices are selling like hotcakes. If the installed base for them, or really any other virtual assistant, gets massive, and consumers start using those devices for the types of things and the purposes that people are generally using Google mobile and desktop search for, what does that do for your business? I don't want to be alarmist with any of this. I am an Alphabet shareholder, I really love the company. But I think he makes a good point. Earlier this month, actually, at an ad industry conference, there was an Amazon VP talking about some of the capabilities and some of the opportunities that Amazon might explore. That led some analysts to speculate that the company might be interested in exploring paid search with its Alexa product. This is not something that is a next-quarter, next-year issue. But over the next five to 10 years, we need to keep an eye on how people are using search, and how people are using home assistants or virtual assistants. Because, if we see that slowly eat into what would otherwise be desktop or mobile search, you have to wonder about how that might impact Google's core business, and really what prints money for them and allows them to fund all of these other projects.\n\nPriestley: Yeah. And also, which products they're using. If everybody starts adopting the Google Nest, then they're good.\n\nLewis: Yeah. If people are using Nest or Google Assistant, then yeah, not a huge problem, that will keep them within that ecosystem. If they are using products that don't lean on Google search, and you have platforms that are able to monetize that search, Google might get crowded out a little bit. Again, Google did $26 billion in revenue this quarter. The vast majority of that was online ads. It's a huge market. I think people's more in-depth searching, or more research-based stuff, is always going to be on desktop or mobile. You can only glean so much from audio. But if you want the quick answer on something -- say you want to know who was the fifth president of the United States -- you can find that out with a voice search, and not really have to worry about being on mobile or desktop. And that's less impressions for Google Ad Search. So, it's something to keep in mind. Again, this is a five, 10-year risk. But, just, investors, keep an eye on what's going on with the virtual assistant market, because it's something that could impact Alphabet down the road.\n\nPriestley: That's really interesting. I will hand the baton back to you. [laughs]\n\nLewis: Oh, you're going to let me wrap up? That's so magnanimous of you.\n\nWell, listeners, that does it for this episode of Industry Focus .

Shareholders were blindsided when the company agreed to acquire LivingSocial. With LivingSocial closing quickly in the quarter, will Groupon surprise investors with that acquisition?\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGroupon described LivingSocial's cost as not material, but it could still have a positive impact on the business. GRPN forecast revenue guidance for FY 2016 as high as $3.15 billion. EBITDA of $150 million to $165 million already surpassed the consensus estimates of $154 million.\n\nWatch GRPN's Cash Flow\n\nGroupon's third-quarter cash flow was down $53.7 million, due to restructuring and litigation costs. When the company reports fourth-quarter results on Feb. 15, seasonal strength may result in higher revenue.\n\nRemember that this quarter will include Black Friday and Christmas. This is historically GRPN's biggest quarter of the year. The lower operating expenditures - thanks to cost cuts made last quarter - may contribute to a positive FCF.\n\nMerchants who signed on during the holidays will add to Groupon's sales totals. Existing customers may have added more promotions. Since businesses take on risks but GRPN supplies the network of customers seeking a deal, it is a win-win for both parties.\n\nCustomers who are cash-strapped flock to businesses like Dollar General Corp. (NYSE: DG ). So long as Groupon is around to promote businesses through daily deals, its earnings potential will get stronger over time. GRPN stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 0.67x compared to 1x with Dollar General. Groupon clearly operates differently than companies like DG or TJX Companies Inc (NYSE: TJX ). The latter two rely on foot traffic in stores to drive sales. GRPN stock relies on merchants offering up deals and customers buying them online.\n\nExpect Less Competition for Groupon Stock\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) exit from the daily deals market in 2015 should lead to higher revenue and lower costs for GRPN. Taking out LivingSocial removes yet another competitor. It takes several quarters before these factors show up in Groupon's bottom line. This is already showing up in the North American business. In the third quarter, sales in this region grew 10%, the highest in six quarters :\n\n\"That's most apparent in North America where our local business grew 10% year-over-year. The highest in six quarters, helping us deliver revenue of $720 million and adjusted EBITDA of $32 million.\"\n\nGRPN added a whopping 1.2 million new customers in North America, its highest in more than three years.\n\nPart of this could be attributed to the fact that Groupon spent $88 million in online and offline marketing last quarter. Due to its scaled and accountable advertising platform, investors should anticipate customer spending growing proportionately faster than GRPN's ad spend.\n\nGroupon said it had a cumulative 140 million downloads at the end of the third quarter. Further investments in this technology, combined with digital campaigns through Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) will further drive traffic to GRPN.\n\nPortfolio Allocation to GRPN Stock\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nGiven the speculative nature of GRPN stock, investors should not set a high allocation in it. Here is an example of a live trading account that returned 16.5% monthly.\n\nHere are two other related trading strategies for GRPN stock:\n\nStrategy 2 with GRPN giving a 5.5% monthly yield\n\nStrategy 3 with GRPN, having a 5.3% monthly yield\n\nChances are good that the company had a solid quarter; therefore, Groupon stock could make a \"boom\" and reverse the downtrend on its share price.\n\nAs of this writing, Christ Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Why Groupon Inc (GRPN) Stock Is Ready for a Comeback appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "\"Buying what you know about is a very sophisticated strategy that many professionals have neglected to put into practice.\" [i] - Peter Lynch\n\nThe author isn't sure just how descriptive the above statement is when applied to institutional money managers and investment analysts today. The ones we have spoken to seem to have a very detailed understanding of all the companies and industries they cover. The author does believe it accurately describes the average individual stockpicker.\n\nIntroduction\n\nInvesting, as practiced by the average investor, is a game rigged so the house almost always wins. Wall Street will take the average investor's life savings, and will do so dispassionately and unapologetically. This fundamental understanding is essential to engaging in buying and selling activity in the market.\n\n\"Investing is a zero-sum game. To buy a stock, someone else has to be selling. You are betting you know the company better than the person that is selling it to you. \" [ii] - Peter Lynch\n\nMake no mistake about it, buying and selling stocks is a competition. It is serious, it is real, and if one is not constantly aware of this fact and doesn't take it seriously, one is apt to be a sucker. Someone is always trying to either sell someone else an overpriced security, or they are trying to buy another person's underpriced security for pennies on the dollar. That is what the market often is, [iii] an exchange to take advantage of the person on the other end of a transaction. This reality is not always appreciated, as one's competitor is rarely seen, but it is a competition all the same, and one with real financial stakes. Every single time you buy or sell a stock, there is somebody on the other side of that transaction betting you are wrong, and they are betting real money on it. They are also betting they know more than you, and they are trying to exploit your ignorance in the business underlying the security.\n\n\"There are rich teams, and there are poor teams, and then there's fifty feet of crap, and then there is us.\" - Brad Pitt's character Billy Beane in Michael Lewis' Moneyball, speaking of the Oakland Athletics\n\nWhat's more, the game most institutional money managers and Wall Street institutions play is stacked heavily in their favor. They have more resources than the amateur investor, better industry coverage, better contacts, better access to management teams, better technology, brilliant (and let's face it, more intelligent) analysts with more prestigious post graduate and doctoral degrees from the finest institutions in the country. Playing a game even remotely in this machine's wheelhouse is almost certain to be a disaster. The chances are that those institutions are generally on the other side of every transaction the amateur investor enters into.\n\nIf the reader is not yet discouraged, he or she should be. Forgetting the above facts and becoming complacent, or even arrogant, will not lend the sense of humility and caution that are necessary for successful stock picking. A measure of arrogance is necessary in picking stocks, but it must always be balanced with humility and awareness, and it is good only when logically supported by research and analysis. All of this brings us to a harsh truth that the reader will be wise to remember.\n\n\"Choosing individual stocks without any idea of what you're looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a burning match. You may live, but you're still an idiot.\" [iv] - Joel Greenblatt\n\nIf we accept Mr. Greenblatt's statement as true, and the author is a firm believer it is true, then why even try to buy and sell individual securities? Well, the real truth is that buying and selling individual stocks is generally only stupid if one engages in the practice in the way almost everybody always does. Put another way, there is a right way, and then there is the way nearly everyone does it. The right way is the exception.\n\nDespite all the above, the amateur may still achieve results in excess of the majority of the professionals if the amateur insists on playing his or her own game on his or her own field. To make money consistently over the long term, the investor needs to only bet when the odds are in his or her favor; in other words, only when he or she has an edge over the competition.\n\nHow do we do that? The author will answer the question by posing a few questions of his own:\n\nWouldn't it be nice if undervalued companies that are profitable, with durable competitive advantages and reliable earnings streams, companies that may even be likely to compound over time had like a flashing light and loud noise going off to attract our attention, but only our attention (meaning most of the competition would miss the signs)?\n\nWouldn't it be nice if we could take the thing we are best at, that we know the most about, and we could place bets on that, and even then could choose to only bet when we were certain, or nearly certain that we will win?\n\nWhat we will do in this particular article is to identify a specific \"edge\" that provides most investors a leg up over the large financial institutions and over the army of financial analysts on Wall Street. An edge is a place where the odds are stacked in your favor, through practice, knowledge, skill, time frame, or location. We will also provide real world examples on how to exploit these edges, but first, please permit us an analogy, to really drive the concepts home into the reader's grey matter.\n\nSelecting Your Opponent…\n\nI cannot help but remember my friend from London, in what is known as the East End . Mr. McDonald-Smith is a fairly large man of Jamaican descent, speaks fluent Spanish due to a couple of years living in the Dominican Republic, and is, as they say in England, quite fit. You know the type, someone with arms the size of their head where even an extra-large shirt is in constant danger of popping its buttons? Mr. McDonald-Smith can honestly boast that he has never been beaten in arm-wrestling. This feat is not overly surprising when looking at him, but how is it possible that one can have a 100% success rate in anything? Surely, there is always someone stronger, or more skilled, and even if there were no such person; doesn't everybody just have a bad day once in a while? In fact, Mr. McDonald-Smith is not an undefeated arm-wrestler because he is the strongest man in the world, nor is he undefeated because he is the world's most skilled practitioner of the sport. No, the fact is that Mr. McDonald-Smith is undefeated due to a very simple strategy that is designed to help him be successful.\n\nWhat is his secret? It is quite simple. He never engages in a match with anybody that he isn't absolutely certain he can beat. In such a manner, he can honestly say he has never been outmatched. He never has, and so long as he continues in his strategy, he never will be. As he grows older, he will undoubtedly accept fewer and fewer challengers until one day he will retire completely from this activity, undefeated and triumphant. Why is this important? Well, Mr. McDonald-Smith has an edge in arm-wrestling. He is large of stature. He is strong. He is fit. He is smart. And he manages his ego. Taken as a percentage, the probabilities of encountering a formidable opponent are quite small. On the rare occasion that he meets such an opponent, Mr. McDonald-Smith graciously declines the match.\n\nNow, here's the key to the strategy: It wouldn't work in a formal arm-wrestling tournament where one was forced to take on every opponent placed in front of him. In fact, it may be quite useless. While Mr. McDonald-Smith is likely to do quite well in a tournament, and he may even advance to the later rounds, he is unlikely to win simply because there is always someone stronger, or who has trained longer and more diligently. Luckily for Mr. McDonald-Smith, he needn't ever enter such a tournament. There is no reason to outside of ego.\n\nWhat is the point? Don't play if (and when) you can't win.\n\nExamples of Utilizing One's Edge\n\nNow for some real-world examples to illustrate the value of investing in what you know, and using one's individual knowledge and skills to avoid losing money, and to achieve out-sized investment returns. As the author is trained as a tax CPA, these particular examples revolve around corporate income taxes. One needn't understand GAAP accounting for income taxes in order to understand the underlying point (If the author had been a used car salesman, we likely would have made some investments in car manufacturers or rental car companies (one could have made a lot of money investing in Budget, Avis, Hertz, Dollar, etc. if they understood the business). The point is to invest in what one knows and understands).\n\nIt does not take many home runs and grand slams to result in a satisfactory investment record if one does not lose money in the process. This bears repeating, with emphasis. It does not take many home runs and grand slams to result in a satisfactory investment record if one does not lose money in the process . That's not to say we try to swing for the fences. Most investors equate swinging for the fences with risk, but that is not the only way to hit a home run. When a perfect pitch comes along, a well-rehearsed swing can result in the ball just flying off the bat with ease. Likewise, sometimes, the most conservative investments can produce the most significant results; particularly if one understands the space and can recognize the opportunities and the risks. This also bears repeating. Sometimes the most conservative investments can produce the most significant results; particularly if one understands the space and can recognize the opportunities and the risks.\n\nVonage (NYSE: VG ) and Spectrum Brand Holdings (NYSE: SPB ) are both examples of the author finding signals in financial statements to reveal attractive investment opportunities. In both cases, our attention was drawn by the inclusion of atypical effective tax rates in the respective company's SEC filings. Because of our experience with accounting for income tax provisions in our day job, we were able to quickly identify and interpret these signals despite working fairly hectic schedules, and after a review of the rest of the financial statements and the companies' business operations, market positioning, management, and outlook, were able to open an investment in a fairly timely manner, which turned out to be key, as the shares appreciated substantially post purchase.\n\nVonage\n\nStock High: $7.88 (01/13/2017)\n\nRecent Price: $6.88 (02/03/2017)\n\nPrice Paid: $2.31; $1.71; $2.25 (01/24/2012; 5/25/12; 4/2/12)\n\nVonage Holdings Corp. is an example of how experience in financial statement preparation, specifically the accounting for income taxes can lead one to a compelling investment thesis.\n\nVG is a voice-over IP (( VOIP )) communications company (i.e. an Internet-based telephone provider) with catchy television advertising spots featuring either someone on the beach getting hit in the head with a flying box with the Vonage brand on it, or with various personalities declaring their independence from land lines by stating \"this is my last phone bill\" and then crumpling it up and tossing it into a massive pile in the middle of a warehouse, suggesting that everyone is doing it. It was a trendy IPO that promptly plummeted and lost 80% of its market value. Having, for years during college, used AOL's (AOL) dial-up Internet CDs that came free in the mail to access the Internet, we appreciated how the bargain basement telephone service that Vonage provided could be attractive to low-income users, particularly those with non-resident family and friends. Having also been an early fan of Google's ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) Gmail chat and calling features (now called Hangouts), we and our work colleagues were already adopters of the technology. We recognized that, much like AOL's dial-up CDs had previously, land-based telephone lines were fast going obsolete. The Company had paid down approximately $130M in debt, bringing its leverage to about 0.5x net income, and reducing its interest expense year over year by 2/3. The Company had a fairly clean balance sheet, stable revenue, new apps and overseas partnerships, so good news on the horizon. Add to that a swing to significant profitability, and the Company was trading at a PE of less than 5x and an EV/EBITDA of 3-4x. The Company looked cheap on those metrics alone, and there were no signs that business would deteriorate any time soon.\n\nSo where did our edge come in? What drew our attention to Vonage was the published effective tax rate (( ETR )). For calendar 2011 the ETR was a -375%, as in a benefit (another word for a tax gain, the recognition of which actually increases net income rather than decreases it) and not an expense. Now, in some situations, ETRs can be misleading, particularly when companies are operating near break-even, but Vonage was profitable in 2011 with pre-tax earnings of $86.3M. It pays to take a look at the footnotes and tax rate reconciliation in such situations to see what is driving the tax benefit.\n\nWe reproduce the Company's tax rate reconciliation below from its 2011 Form 10-K: [v]\n\nHere we see that it was the release of a valuation allowance ((VA)) on the deferred tax assets (DTAs) that was driving the tax benefit (A valuation allowance is a fancy way of saying that an asset can't be recognized because it is uncertain if it will ever provide a benefit to the Company). By removing a VA, the Company is sending a signal that the benefit of the assets will be recognized, and the independent auditors must agree that such a position is reasonable. The next step then is to determine what deferred tax assets the Company is now benefiting from.\n\nAgain from the 2011 Form 10-K:\n\n\"Our net deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss carry forwards (\"NOLs\"). We are required to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if we conclude that it is more likely than not that taxable income generated in the future will be insufficient to utilize the future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets (namely, the NOLs), prior to expiration. We periodically review this conclusion, which requires significant management judgment. Until the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded a valuation allowance fully against our net deferred tax assets. In 2011, we completed our first full year of taxable income and completed our budgetary process for periods subsequent to 2011, which anticipates continued taxable income in the future. \" [vi] ( Emphasis added)\n\nTo interject some commentary here, what this means is that, by the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company had not only just demonstrated a pattern of profitability, but it was projecting profitability in the future at least sufficient to recognize the NOLs as DTAs without an offsetting VA. So now we know the Company expects to continue its pattern of significant profitability, and will largely be able to avoid paying taxes during the lifetime of the NOLs. But what exactly does that mean? Let's continue, and remember that the below numbers are shown in thousands (000s), so for example, $300,000 is really $300 million .\n\n\"Based upon these factors and our sustained profitable operating performance over the past three years excluding certain losses associated with our prior convertible notes and our December 2010 debt refinancing, our evaluation determined that the benefit resulting from our net deferred tax assets (namely, the NOLs), are likely to be realized prior to their expiration . Accordingly, we released the related valuation allowance against our United States federal and Canada net deferred tax assets, and a portion of the allowance against our state net deferred tax assets as certain NOLs may expire prior to utilization due to shorter utilization periods in certain states, resulting in a one-time non-cash income tax benefit of $325,601 and a corresponding net deferred tax asset of $325,601 in the fourth quarter of 2011.\" [vii] ( Emphasis added)\n\nAccountants and attorneys love using run-on sentences. The $325M benefit they are talking about recognizing now that they are removing the VA is not how much income the NOLs are expected to offset, rather, it is the tax effected (think cash tax savings impact) amount of U.S./Canada taxes that will not have to be paid in the future. The gross amount of income the NOLs can offset is shown below:\n\n\"As of December 31, 2011, we had NOLs for United States federal and state tax purposes of $794,714 and $423,963, respectively…\" [viii]\n\nOne can see this activity occurring on both the balance sheet and the income statement. A quick review of the NOL expiration schedule in the tax footnote provides additional insight into the minimum projected profitability of the Company over the next 18 years.\n\nSo what did our quick check of the footnotes in the SEC filings yield? Not insignificantly, we discovered that the $326M tax benefit in calendar 2011 was due to the release of a valuation allowance on $885M of Federal net operating losses (NOLs) booked as an asset on the balance sheet. What this means, in essence, is that the Company was not only demonstrating an impressive return to profitability in the prior year (2011), but that it also had significant expectations of profitability into the foreseeable future. Generally speaking, independent auditors are reluctant to sign off on such a large tax benefit/VA release without compelling income projections and a solid history of recent earnings that are more than sufficient to offset the NOLs. We have seen exceptions to this of course, but provided the auditor is reputable, those exceptions are few and far between.\n\nBottom line; all else being equal, when a company with a $400M market capitalization and enterprise value recognizes a $326M GAAP gain due to the more-likely-than-not expectation of at least $885M of taxable income over the coming years, and then add to that the PE and EV/EBITDA under 5x and very little leverage, it's a good bet that company is worth a whole lot more than the current $2/share. It also may provide a competitive advantage over new market entrants that must pay taxes over the coming decade. The cash that would otherwise go to pay taxes may be used to amortize debt, invest in the business, repurchase shares, pay a dividend, or any number of activities management may think of to create value and increase earnings further.\n\nWith the Company's stock trading around $2 per share, and armed with the confidence provided by our edge in financial statement analysis (with particular focus on the income tax provision), and further armed with a sufficient understanding of the business in which it operates, we felt safe entering a position. The results were satisfactory, as illustrated in the share price chart below. Although the shares dipped not insignificantly immediately after our purchase, we took the opportunity to increase our position (remember, we could act with confidence because we understood what we owned, and what the Company and the auditors believed the future held). The shares doubled within the year, and have trended upwards since.\n\nLessons\n\nWhen a company's shares are trading at an aggregate market capitalization of under $400M, is not heavily levered, and then that same company recognizes over $100M of annual EBITDA, $86M of pre-tax income, and on top of all that, books a $326M deferred tax asset for NOLs, that is a good sign that not only is the company expecting to earn income equivalent to the gross underlying NOLs prior to expiration, but also coupled with a clean balance sheet and sufficient cash that the company is worth looking at more closely.\n\nSpectrum Brand Holdings was in many ways the opposite of Vonage, but our attention was attracted for much the same reasons.\n\nSpectrum Brand Holdings\n\nRecent Price: $132.76 (02/03/2017)\n\nPrice Paid: $25.07 (10/19/11)\n\n\"Decisions to buy and sell stocks should be based solely on the investment merits\" - Joel Greenblatt\n\nSpectrum Brand Holdings owns a number of household brand names, including Rayovac Batteries, Black & Decker, Russell Hobbs, Black Flag, George Foreman Grills, Spectracide, Cutter, Repel, Armor All, STP, etc. SPB's debt-financed, acquisition spree in the 2000s resulted in a bankruptcy filing that wiped out shareholders in 2009. One can read more about the Company's background here . [ix] The Company was still recovering the following two years, when in 2011 we noticed the effective tax rate. We only even saw that as we were looking up Prestige Brands Holdings (NYSE: PBH ) and mistyped the ticker symbol. Incidentally, we ended up entering positions in both companies (better lucky than good).\n\n\"Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations is approximately 24% and 249% for the Fiscal 2011 Quarter and Fiscal 2011 Nine Months, respectively.\" [x]\n\nThe impact to the tax rate reconciliation for the quarter was even more pronounced, in the event that a 249% effective tax rate wasn't enough to raise eyebrows.\n\nThus, whereas Vonage had recognized a large tax benefit due to the lifting of a valuation allowance, Spectrum was recognizing a large tax expense. This is generally not good. The question of course was why? Were earnings deteriorating? Was it merely do to a change in control? Were there not sufficient income projections going forward to offset NOLs? Reading further we got more information:\n\n\"At July 3, 2011, we are estimating that at September 30, 2011 we will have U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1,156 million and $1,006 million, respectively, which will expire through years ending in 2032, and we will have foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $143 million, which will expire beginning in 2011. Certain of the foreign net operating losses have indefinite carryforward periods. As mentioned above, limitations apply to a substantial portion of the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in accordance with IRC Section 382. As such, we estimate that approximately $299 million of our federal and $463 million of our state net operating losses will expire unused.\" [xi]\n\nThat last bit about the §382 limitations really just says that due to one or more changes in control (i.e. ownership transfers of more than 5% of the company, which will generally occur in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization) that there is a limit to how much of the NOLs may be used in any given year, irrespective of profitability. For example, if the Company were to earn $1.2B in fiscal 2011 (implausible we know, but we are making an illustration), Spectrum would be limited to how much of the NOLs could be used to offset that income, and so on, and so forth until the NOLs expired.\n\n\"The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions. We establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate it is more likely than not that the tax assets will not be realized. We base these estimates on projections of future income, including tax planning strategies, in certain jurisdictions. Changes in industry conditions and other economic conditions may impact our ability to project future income. ASC 740 requires the establishment of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In accordance with ASC 740, we periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and determine if adjustments to the valuation allowance are appropriate. As a result of this assessment, we determined that a full valuation allowance is required against the tax benefit of our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. , excluding certain indefinite lived intangibles. In addition, certain other subsidiaries are subject to valuation allowances with respect to certain deferred tax assets. During the Fiscal 2011 Quarter we decreased our valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets by approximately $30 million. Our total valuation allowance, established for the tax benefit of deferred tax assets that may not be realized, was approximately $350 million and $331 million at July 3, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively. Of this amount, approximately $339 million and $300 million relates to U.S. net deferred tax assets at July 3, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively and approximately $11 million and $31 million relates to foreign net deferred tax assets at July 3, 2011 and September 30, 2010, respectively.\" [xii] ( Emphasis added)\n\nThe Company's footnotes for fiscal 2010 [xiii] revealed somewhat more detail on the NOLs and their expirations.\n\nTherefore, in contrast with Vonage, Spectrum did not anticipate being able to utilize its NOLs prior to expiration, due both to §382 limitations and/or insufficient taxable income against which to offset the NOLs. In addition, the Company was still fairly levered with $1.7B of long-term debt [xiv] on its balance sheet.\n\nSo why were we interested? Well, we liked the assets and brands, which were consumer goods with respectable, durable competitive advantages. Although not always the market leader (e.g. Rayovac was competing fiercely with Energizer and Duracell on the platform of \"equal or better value at a lower cost\"), the value proposition and barriers to entry were considerable. In addition, due to the heavy debt load which required about $200M of annualized interest payments [xv] per year, the income tax provision was skewing the effective tax rate; therefore, net income (and hence the PE ratio) were, if not entirely worthless, not necessarily reflective of the Company's cash generation capabilities, nor the value of the entire business.\n\n\"Companies that spend money like drunken sailors, especially on acquisitions and real estate, are left with a huge depreciation allowance and a lot of debts to pay off, which gives them a high cash flow/low earnings profile.\" [xvi]\n\nThe truth was the Company had significant operating income [xvii] and was throwing off significant amounts of cash before interest payments and debt amortization. [xviii] The ETR attracted our attention, but upon closer inspection, we became comfortable with the Company's value strategy, its place in the market, the growth in its earnings and cash flow, its ability to service and amortize its debt, and the defensibility of its business. All things considered, we initiated a position and determined to watch the year-end results [xix] closely.\n\nSPB was trading in the $25 range prior to our entry. SPB has subsequently traded up to north of $130 per share. In this case, the ETR merely attracted our attention to a compelling investment possibility so we could study it further. It was a couple months later when the Form 10-K came out that we believed we had something really special. The Company had reduced its long-term debt by $180M from $1.72B to $1.54B [xx] and net cash provided by operating activities was $227M. [xxi] It seemed clear to us that the Company could service its debt load, and worst-case scenario could sell off one or more brands to de-lever further, but we didn't expect that would be necessary.\n\nFurther research into SPB prior to the shares taking off similarly revealed an interesting arbitrage opportunity via the shares of Harbinger Capital Group (NYSE: HRG ), where one could take advantage of the value gap in SPB at the same time as one could take advantage in the value gap in HRG. This is further discussed immediately below, and is really an extension of the same investment.\n\nLessons:\n\n\"The best stock to buy may be the one you already own.\" [xxii] - Peter Lynch\n\n- Peter Lynch One should listen to Peter Lynch and use one's unique edge to capitalize on opportunities in one's circle of competency.\n\nOne should continue to listen to Warren Buffett and not sell out of a company with great long-term prospects, a durable competitive advantage, and growing earnings, which was purchased at a fair price. Just hold it forever (unless it is a cyclical).\n\n\"As I study these reports now, I realize that many stocks that I held for a few months I should have held a lot longer. This wouldn't have been unconditional loyalty; it would have been sticking to companies that were getting more and more attractive…. By abandoning these great companies for lesser issues, I became a victim of the all-too-common practice of 'pulling out the flowers and watering the weeds'\" - Peter Lynch\n\nHarbinger Capital Group\n\nRecent Price: $16.79 (02/02/2017)\n\nPrice Paid: $4.06; $4.10; $4.01 (12/29/11; 12/29/11; 12/31/2013)\n\nIn 2010, Harbinger Capital Group controlled Russell Hobbs, and merged it with Spectrum Brands, leaving HRG with a majority stake in SPB. HRG also owned a valuable insurance company. HRG was owned primarily by Harbinger Capital Partners (NYSE: HCP ), a hedge fund that made billions betting against subprime mortgages during the credit crisis.\n\nHCP and its founder, Philip Falcone, were at the time under indictment by the SEC, which alleged that Falcone had misused fund assets for personal use, and that HCP had engaged in unfair redemption practices, allowing favored investors such as Goldman Sachs to redeem partnership interests, while locking up other investors (Note these allegations were later settled). The indictment had the result of temporarily depressing the shares of HRG, in our view, understandably, but excessively given the nature of holdings and operations in HRG. One may read a little about this arbitrage play in the comments of the above referenced article on Spectrum Brand Holdings, reproduced again here . [xxiii] One may further read an article on this special situation here . [xxiv]\n\nThere was certainly some control risk in this arbitrage play, but during 2011, HRG actually traded at a value that was less than its publicly-traded ownership in SPB, giving a negative value to the insurance company. As SPB was similarly undervalued at the time, an investment in the undervalued HRG was another way to obtain the similarly undervalued shares of SPB at a significant discount to their trading value. This was just one of the odd, short-term arbitrage opportunities that occasionally arise in an otherwise efficient market. We held the position while the arbitrage gap narrowed, and then exited.\n\nIt is important to note a couple of items. We were not comfortable holding HRG long-term due to the ownership situation. We would have been comfortable holding SPB forever, and SPB has certainly performed better than HRG over the subsequent time period. Sometimes we can be too smart by half, as we then missed out on the subsequent run-up in SPB shares. Thus, it often makes sense to pursue the simplest course. Complexity often equates with risk. The arbitrage play did work, however.\n\nLessons:\n\nSometimes we can be too smart by half, as we then missed out on the subsequent run-up in SPB shares. Thus, it often makes sense to pursue the simplest course.\n\nComplexity often equates with risk.\n\nDo you start to see how, with a little awareness and knowledge and skill and discipline you can win, most of the time, and you can win big? It just requires a little patience, and a little uncommon , common sense.\n\nIt is instructive to note that both examples occurred after the recent bull market was well underway. The Dow had recovered from a low of around 6,000 to 11,000-12,000, and despite not yet recovering its pre-Great Recession level of 14,000, many prognosticators and value investors were opining that the bull market was running out of gas and that values were few and far between. In August and September of 2011, just a few months earlier, the market experienced a slight correction. By investing in what we understood, we were able to find all kinds of bargains after our initial purchases during the Great Recession had significantly appreciated, and this was during a period of time when many were fretting the direction of the market and that there were few if any compelling values available. In our own wheelhouse, we were nearly tripping over them in late 2011 and early 2012.\n\nIf that Didn't Convince You…\n\nIn 1994, Mr. Peter Lynch of Fidelity Magellan fame said the following about edges during a lecture at the National Press Club. We are reproducing several paragraphs to drive the point home:\n\n\"You need an edge to make money, too. People have incredible edges and they throw them away. I'll give you a quick example of, uh, Smith-Kline. This is a stock that had Tagamet. Now you didn't have to buy Smith-Kline when Tagamet was doing clinical trials. You didn't have to buy Smith-Kline when Tagamet was talked about in the New England Journal of Medicine, or the British version, Lancet. You could have bought Smith-Kline a year after Tagamet came out. Let's say your spouse, your mother, your father, your nurse, your druggist. You're writing all these prescriptions. Tagamet was doing an amazing job curing ulcers. And it was a wonderful pill for the company because if you stopped taking it, the ulcers came back. It wasn't a crummy product if you took it for a buck and then it went away. But it was a great product for the company. But you could have bought it two years after the product was on the market and made five-to-six times your money. I mean all the druggists, all the nurses, all the people, I mean millions of people saw this product. And they're out buying oil companies or drilling rigs. It happens. And then three years later or four years later, Glaxo, even a bigger company, this is a huge company, a British company, brought out Zantac which was a better, at that time an improved product, and you could have seen that take market share, do well, and you could have bought Glaxo and tripled your money. So you only need a few stocks in your lifetime. They're in your industry. I think of people, if you'd worked in the auto industry, let's say you're an auto dealer, the last ten years. You would have seen Chrysler come out with the mini-van. If you were a Buick dealer, a Toyota dealer, a Honda dealer… You would have seen Chrysler dealerships packed with people. You could have made ten times your money on Chrysler a year after the minivan came out. Ford introduces the Taurus Sable, the most exceptional line of cars in the last twenty years. Ford went up seven-fold on the Taurus Sable. So if you're a car dealer, you only need to buy a few stocks every decade. When your lifetime's over, you don't need a lot of five-baggers to make a lot of money, starting with ten thousand dollars or five thousand dollars. So in your own industry you're going to see a lot of stocks. And that is what bothers me. There are good stocks out there that are looking for you, and people just aren't listening. They're just not watching it. And people have incredible edges. People have big edges over me. They work in the aluminum industry. They see aluminum inventories coming down six straight months. They see demand improving. And in America today it is hard to get an EPA permit for a bowling alley, never mind an aluminum smelter. So you know when aluminum gets tight you just can't build seven aluminum smelters. So when you see this coming you can say, wait a second, I can make some money. When an industry goes from terrible to mediocre, the stock goes north. When it goes from mediocre to good, the stock goes north. And when it goes from good to terrific the stock goes north. There's lots of ways to make money in your own industry. You can be a supplier in the industry, you can be a customer. It happens in the paper industry, it happens in the steel industry. It doesn't happen every week, but if you're in some field, you'll see a turn, you'll see something in the publishing industry. These things come along and it is just mind boggling, people throw it away. \" [xxv] ( Emphasis added)\n\nThe point is that nearly everyone has an edge. If they choose only to play their game in which that edge exists, they are more likely to come out on top. Of course, one must exercise the discipline of investing in one's own circle of competence, and then waiting for their pitch.\n\nConclusion\n\nParticipating in the market is like fishing in waters teeming with both fish and sharks. If one just jumps in and tries to swim with the sharks, bad things are likely to result. And while we are on the subject of sharks…\n\nThe author's spouse enjoys watching the CNBC show Shark Tank . Last week, she made the comment that \"Mark Cuban is always 'out'. It has been a long time since he has made a deal.\" Although she likely was frustrated by this observation, her comment caught our attention. We did a quick google search for \"Mark Cuban\" and \"investing\" on YouTube, and we found an interview [xxvi] from August 2011. Now, August 2011 was a month in which, after the market had gained maybe 80% since the 2009 great recession lows, the market started gyrating and was threatening to correct, and professional commentators were beginning to throw around the word \"recession\" again. A great many professional money managers believed the market was fairly, or even overly valued, and fear was again beginning to creep into Wall Street. In this interview Mr. Cuban said the following:\n\n\" Any time there's volatility and any time there's change there's opportunity. Now I say it's great because I've taken a whole different approach to investing than most people. You know, I think buy and hold is a crock of sh--. I think, you know, the idea that you always have to invest your cash is not far behind, and so I've always been of the attitude that unless you really have a commitment to something, just keep your money in cash, knowing that at some point in time, there's going to be a week or two like we've had…\"\n\nWhen the interviewer observes there has been a lot of \"stuff\" hitting the fan lately, Mr. Cuban continues:\n\n\"Exactly the point. That's where the opportunity is. Then when everything starts getting crazy, I call it the world series of investing, you know, that's where you start digging in… You've got all these professional people on the other side of trades. When I started investing in stocks in the early 90's after I sold my first company, you could understand different elements of the market better than the professionals… Today there's so much money in these huge hedge funds, and they have such professional research, and in depth research, there aren't any advantages for the individual traders , and so my approach has always been, unless I know something specific, put it in cash .\" (Emphasis added)\n\nWe might take the creative liberty to amend that last sentence to replace the word \"any\" with the word \"many,\" but the point is largely the same. Most investors significantly underperform the market over the long run, because they invest in things they do not understand, they try to time the market, or they become emotional and jump in and out of securities rather than just staying put and letting the number of bargain purchases and the extent of the bargains in companies dictate how much of their capital is invested. Finally, they throw their edges away and play Wall Street's game. However, by following certain investing principles and by taking deliberate steps, the average investor can play their own game, on their own terms, and come out ahead.\n\nThe successful, self-directed investor must adopt a proven, viable investment framework, insist on a margin of safety, and only play the game when the odds are stacked in the investor's favor. In other words, the investor must insist upon exploiting his or her edge. If this results in their being in cash, not when market prognosticators are preaching doom and gloom, and not when their emotions are telling them the market is overvalued, but when they simply cannot find compelling investment opportunities in their own wheelhouse , then holding cash may be the smartest thing one can do. The average active, self-directed investor should not be worried about having a significant amount of their portfolio in cash. Seth Klarman of Baupost fame has strung together a 30-odd year track record of significant out-performance, and absolute performance in nearly every year while holding nearly one-half of his fund in cash, on average. It is very difficult to lose one's money in cash. By being cautious and conservative when compelling bargains are not prevalent, and then by insisting on an edge before investing that cash in a security, truly amazing results can occur. This requires patience and discipline, but those are concepts for separate articles.\n\nAs Peter Lynch has written, it only takes a few five-to-ten-baggers to result in an amazing long-term investment record (provided the investor doesn't make too many stupid mistakes in the meanwhile).\n\n\"It was huge gains in a few huge positions that led to Magellan's superior results.\" [xxvii] - Peter Lynch \"I've said before that an amateur who devotes a small amount of study to companies in an industry he or she knows something about can outperform 95 percent of the paid experts who manage the mutual funds, plus have fun doing it.\" [xxviii] - Peter Lynch\n\nIf one is hell-bent on being fully invested at all times, one may conceivably invest the balance of their portfolio in Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), just don't go investing in stocks in which you do not have an edge, merely because compelling bargains within your wheelhouse are few and far between. We all worked hard to save enough money to invest; in most cases for years, or even decades. Don't go betting it willy-nilly in a rigged game on something you know nothing about.\n\n[i] Peter Lynch, Beating the Street, copyright 1993, 1994, Simon & Schuster Paperbacks, p 28.\n\n[ii] Peter Lynch Speech, National Press Club, October 8, 1994.

Since hitting a low near $812 on Feb. 1, GOOGL stock has steadily bounced back, regaining more than 3% of the ground it lost following a poorly received fourth-quarter earnings report.\n\nBut you haven't missed out on the fun. Alphabet stock still has some gas in the tank.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge Alphabet's bounce from the $812 region was not happenstance. The shares were bolstered by support from their rising 50-day moving average, and a wealth of psychological support from the nearby $800 area. Furthermore, GOOGL stock has been in rally mode since mid-2015, gaining some 53% during this time frame.\n\nIn other words, the post-earnings dip was less about poor quarterly results and more about an excuse to take some profits off the table.\n\nHowever, now that the situation has corrected itself, and Alphabet stock has emerged from an overbought situation, shares should be poised to run higher.\n\nIf you took my bullish GOOGL recommendation on Jan. 31 and got into the March $830/$850 bull call spread, you are likely already at breakeven or sitting on a profit for the trade. What's more, the odds of breaking out above $850 have improved significantly in the past couple of weeks.\n\nAlternately, if you took the more neutral-to-bullish option and entered the March $800 put sell, you can all but rest easy now that GOOGL stock is headed higher once again.\n\nIf you missed out on those trades, though, there's still time to get in before Alphabet Inc tops out again.\n\nSentiment for Alphabet remains as bullish as ever, with nearly all of the 48 analysts tracked by Thomson/First Call rating GOOGL stock a \"buy.\" Additionally, the 12-month price target has risen over the past month to $990.72, and that bodes well for the shares going forward, as it cuts down on the likelihood of downgrades to \"hold\" over the short-term.\n\nAs for options traders, a bit of caution has crept into GOOGL options since Alphabet's quarterly report, but this, too, is healthy for the shares. Currently, the March put/call open interest ratio rests at 0.76, up from pre-earnings readings near 0.85.\n\nFurthermore, peak March call OI rests well overhead at $900, meaning that Alphabet should see little in the way of potential options-related resistance.\n\nMarch implieds have come down since the end of January, making GOOGL options cheaper. Currently implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 3.3% for Alphabet stock through March expiration. This places the upper bound at $868, while the lower bound lies at $812.\n\n2 Trades for GOOGL Stock\n\nCall Spread: If you missed out on the late January bottom, here's your chance to bet bullish on Alphabet heading into next month. I suggest the March $850/$860 bull call spread.\n\nAt last check, this spread was offered at $3.57, or $357 per pair of contracts. Breakeven lies at $853.57, while a maximum profit of $6.43, or $643 per pair of contracts, is possible if GOOGL stock closes at or above $860 when March options expire.\n\nPut Sell: If you're still on the fence, or if you a neutral-to-bullish stance is more your style, then the March $800 put sell remains a solid trade that has a good chance of finishing out of the money.\n\nAt last check, the March $800 put was bid at $3.30, or $330 per contract. The upside to this put sell strategy is that you keep the premium as long as Alphabet stock closes above $800 when these options expire. The downside is that should GOOGL trade below $800 ahead of expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $800 per share.\n\nAs of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Run With the Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Bulls Now appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "The technology sector isn't always the best place for investment stability, nor are new technology trends ever much of a safe investment. But it doesn't have to be this way. The Internet of Things (IoT) is ushering in a massive wave of technological changes -- nearly 50 billion things will be connected to the IoT by 2020 -- and there are three companies at the forefront of this $7 trillion market that should remain steady, long-term investments: Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) , Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) , and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nVerizon Communications\n\nVerizon is stalwart dividend stock that has plenty of long-term potential in the IoT. The company already dominates the wireless network space despite cutthroat competition from AT&T and T-Mobile , and it's only getting stronger.\n\nVerizon is making early investments in 5G networks that should give the company an edge over its competitors in the IoT network space, much like the company's early push into 4G kept it ahead of the competition. Verizon calls 5G the \"foundation for creating more internet-connected devices\" and says that it will use the network to bring traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters, and other city systems online.\n\nOver the next few months, the company plans on rolling out commercial 5G field tests in a few locations. Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said at an investor conference in December that he believes the company is two to three years ahead of the competition for 5G because of its early tests and the company's recent purchase of the fiber-optic network company XO Communications.\n\n5G will allow new types of faster-than-ever device connections, and Verizon's early mover advantage could pay off down the road.\n\nCisco Systems\n\nCisco is a perfect example of a company that will plug away in its respective field without offering investors much drama -- and at the same time provide a nice 3.3% dividend yield to boot.\n\nCisco has been talking about the IoT for quite some time, but one of biggest moves came early last year when the company announced it was buying Jasper Technologies for $1.4 billion.\n\nJasper is a cloud-based IoT service platform that allows enterprise and service customers to \"launch, manage and monetize IoT services on a global scale.\" In short, Jasper allows companies to bring nearly any device online (think cars or jet engines) and then manage those connections through its proprietary software.\n\nJasper brings with it 3,500 enterprise customers from around the world that have devices running on 27 service providers. And Cisco said that it will be able to add to Jasper's services with its own enterprise Wi-Fi, IoT security solutions, and advanced analytics.\n\nWith Jasper, Cisco transitions further into the the software-as-a-service (SaaS) market that brings recurring revenue, and allows the company to rely a little less on the traditionally cyclical hardware market.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet and its subsidiaries have been extremely aggressive in the IoT space, and given the company's massive market size and its quarterly revenues north of $26 billion, this is certainly a company investors don't need to babysit.\n\nMost of Alphabet's IoT opportunities stem from Google, which is already a leader in the connected home space with Google Home and Nest Labs. By having a slew of IoT devices for the home, along with an embedded smart assistant in Google Home, the company is helping to lead the way in IoT home connections.\n\nBut one of Alphabet's biggest IoT pushes right now comes from a company called Waymo, which was recently spun out of Google . Waymo is the product of years of research and real-world testing of self-driving cars and Google is looking to the company to now stand on its own and start generating revenue.\n\nWaymo has partnered with Fiat Chrysler to bring 100 self-driving minivans to to the roadways to begin testing an autonomous driving service. The company is likely still years away from bringing in any significant revenue for Google, but it's clear that under Alphabet's umbrella self-driving tech is a big part of the company's IoT plans.\n\nOn top of that, other companies under Alphabet are exploring IoT possibilities, like using nanoparticles to find diseases in the bloodstream, by pairing them to wearable tech devices.\n\nWhatever you do, just don't miss this opportunity\n\nInvestors looking for steady companies shouldn't overlook the massive opportunities that the IoT has to offer . Nearly 50 billion things will be connecting the internet in just a few years and the IoT market has the potential to transform many aspects of our lives. The three stocks above are all big tech names that are tapping into the IoT's potential in their own way, offering investors growth opportunities on top of stable existing businesses.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Verizon Communications\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, the company recentlyÂ reported stronger-than-expected iPhone sales during the key holiday quarter, helping the stock reach a new high.\n\nhttp://www.rttnews.com", "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Pixel Phone holds a significant advantage over third-party Android smartphones. Since its release, Google Assistant - the new AI powered personal assistant - has been a Pixel Phone exclusive. Third-party smartphones remain stuck with the previous generation Google Now. However, Google released an Android \"alpha\" build late last week and the new Android release enables Google Assistant on third-party smartphones.\n\nSource: Google\n\nGOOGL's third-party Android smartphone partners have been feeling a little betrayed since the release of the Pixel Phone last fall.\n\nUp until then, Google had not been directly competing against them. It developed Android and allowed them to use the operating system on their phones for free - a fair trade off for the hundreds of millions of mobile devices defaulting to revenue-generating Google search. Google did release the Nexus line of smartphones, but they were more of a showcase for Android than an attempt to compete against its partners.\n\nThe Pixel Phone's Google Assistant Advantage\n\nThe Pixel Phone changed the equation. It was stamped with the Google name for the first time and it was designed to compete head-to-head with the best of the Android smartphones. In another first, a key new Android feature - Google Assistant - was a Pixel Phone exclusive. Google Assistant leverages Alphabet's latest AI technology in a personal digital assistant that goes beyond Google Now, even gaining the ability to participate in two-way conversations.\n\nThe situation was serious enough to help convince Android smartphone leader Samsung Electronic Co Ltd (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) that it needed its own personal assistant. Samsung's Bixby is expected to debut on the Galaxy S8 .\n\nNew Android Release Spills the Beans: Google Assistant for All?\n\nAndroid Police examined a developer \"alpha\" release of Android over the weekend and discovered that GOOGL may be having a change of heart about keeping Google Assistant to itself.\n\nIts team was able to activate and use Google Assistant on several non-Pixel smartphones, including a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 running Android Marshmallow and a Nexus 6P running Android Nougat.\n\nThis means that GOOGL is at least experimenting with making Google Assistant available to third-party smartphones in an upcoming new Android release.\n\nWhere Would This Leave the Pixel Phone?\n\nWhile Google's Pixel Phone has premium design and a very nice camera, its primary advantage over third-party smartphones is the exclusive availability of Google Assistant. Take that away and it's more or less competing on a level footing with the big guns from the likes of Samsung. True, the Pixel Phone is guaranteed Android updates, but that's no different than the Nexus phones.\n\nWith AI and digital assistants in the spotlight, Google may have decided that having Google Assistant become a standard Android feature is important to maintain its lead over Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhones and Siri.\n\nI wrote a few days ago about Google's struggle against Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) in the smart home . The Amazon Echo and Alexa have taken a huge lead there and Google Assistant on the Google Home speaker and Pixel Phones may not be enough to catch it. If it were to give up its exclusivity and enable Google Assistant on third-party smartphones, GOOGL would suddenly have hundreds of millions of additional devices in play. This would give it far more leverage against Amazon, at the cost of the Pixel Phone competing on a more level playing field.\n\nAnd the company has always marketed the Pixel Phone as being the \"first phone\" with Google Assistant - not the \"only phone\" - leaving the door open for an eventual general roll-out.\n\nOf course, at this point we aren't certain that GOOGL will pull the trigger. The new Android release in question is alpha software - that's before beta. The company may simply be having some developers test Google Assistant compatibility with third-party hardware with no intention of actually opening up the feature. However, hints like the message \"New! You just got the Google Assistant\" suggest that GOOGL is leaning toward ending Pixel Phone exclusivity and rolling out the AI-powered feature as part of a general Android release.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Alphabet Inc - Is Google Assistant Going Everywhere? (GOOGL) appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nData it's what makes the tech world go 'round. And in the case of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ), it's what drives its profits, cash flows and ultimately the value of its stock. Google has made a name for itself delving into people's lives, running it through an algorithm and selling the output to advertisers. Pretty much everything GOOGL stock does - even controlling your thermostat - has to do with creating this huge base of data for the company to play with.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnd its latest, and somewhat secret moves are all about getting its hands another massive pile of people's lives. Google is buying floundering social media network Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ).\n\nWell, not entirely. But GOOGL has started picking off pieces of the Twitter corpse. And by snagging some of TWTR's items now, Alphabet could be setting itself up for to buy the whole enchilada later on. In the end, that actually might be a great deal for GOOGL stock investors as its all about the data.\n\nGOOGL Snags Developer Tools\n\nTwitter has been a potential buyout candidate basically the second it IPO'd a few years ago. Perhaps even more so now that the social network has struggled to see user growth and profitability. TWTR stock has plunged about 60% since its public offering. But like Google, Twitter is much more than just its namesake service. In this case, it's about app development.\n\nFor an undisclosed sum, Alphabet has agreed to buyout Twitter's main developer project - Fabric.\n\nFabric provides a software toolkit for development and design of mobile apps. And even though it's part of Twitter, it's not small potatoes. The software is used by more than 580,000 mobile developers including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NASDAQ: BABA ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's (NYSE: WMT ) Jet.com.\n\nFabric will be folded into Google's own Firebase mobile developer platform, and its employees will be now part of Alphabet.\n\nSo why would the company want this stuff and the talent pool? As I said, it's all about data.\n\nWith the addition of Fabric, GOOGL will own two of the most popular tools for developing mobile apps. Fabric is a favorite stomping ground for app development for Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iOS software for iPhones/iPads. By having the two under one umbrella, it gives Alphabet an easy inroad to help developers make formerly exclusive iPhone apps available for the mobile web and Google's Android software. You know, where GOOGL stock makes a bulk of its advertising dollars.\n\nThe second big data kicker comes from the fact that while much of Google's tools are available for free; many developers will buy computing power and storage from the company's cloud service. It's expected that once Fabric is integrated fully, the deal would be the same. Not only does that boost GOOGL's cloud revenues, but it gives it a chance to comb through all the data being produced and potentially mine it for what it is worth.\n\nBackend as a service (BaaS) platforms like Fabric and Firebase fit perfectly into Google's \"Here, have it for free, we'll just keep the data\" business model.\n\nIn the end, the purchase will allow Google to further cement itself as one of the world's biggest mobile app developers and give it a new source of additional revenue.\n\nAlphabet Still Wants Bluebird\n\nBut what about Twitter's real function - those juicy 140 character tweets and the social network? Even though Google didn't make an offer to buy the firm, the truth is, Twitter proper still makes for an excellent fit for GOOGL stock. Twitter has a hard time data mining and getting advertisers to embrace all those tweets. But for someone like Google, the social media network - and its 300 million users - is pure gold. Advertisers are starting to prefer social media networks and their ability to drill down to specific users.\n\nThe idea behind Twitter selling off this hobby business was so that it could focus on boosting the main product's user base, remove spam/bots and make it a better product. Buy waiting to buy it later, all the hard clean-up work will be done. And if it is still floundering, it gives Alphabet a chance to buy it on the cheap. And considering that there will be now plenty of former Twitter employees at GOOGL, integrating it later on will be a snap.\n\nBottom Line on GOOGL Stock\n\nWhile it continues to be a perpetual rumor, Google's latest actions suggest that Twitter will very much be an Alphabet business in the future. The moves to strengthen its one developer base in mobile apps and snag key personal from the social media company is just the first step. It gives plenty of time for Twitter to refocus and reorganize. In the meantime, the additional revenue from Fabric and cloud sales will be certainly welcome.\n\nAnd when Google finally does buy TWTR, it'll be great news for GOOGL stock. That's 300 million more users it can mine for data and potential extract useful info for advertisers. Google is just one step closer to putting the rumors to rest and snagging the social media company.\n\nAs of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Why Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Would Win Big With a Twitter Buyout appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "It didn't take long for Google's biggest cloud customer to split its allegiances. Just a week after Snap (NYSE: SNAP) announced it signed a $2 billion five-year contract with the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company, it signed a $1 billion contract with Google's biggest cloud competitor -- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) .\n\nSnap will continue to use Google Cloud for the core Snapchat functionality. The Amazon Web Services contract is for \"redundant infrastructure support of our business operations,\" according to Snap's amended S-1 filing.\n\nThe new filing also revealed Snap has been using Amazon for nearly a year, so not much will change in the near term. But the way Snap's contract is structured with Amazon, it could be spending nearly as much on AWS five years from now as it is on Google Cloud.\n\nIt's worth taking a closer look at Snap's cloud contracts. Image Source: Snap.\n\nA quick look at Snap's cloud contracts\n\nYear Amazon spending Google spending 2017 $50 million $400 million* 2018 $125 million $400 million* 2019 $200 million $400 million* 2020 $275 million $400 million* 2021 $350 million $400 million\n\nSource: Snap S-1. *Snap has the option to defer up to 15% of the amount to the subsequent year.\n\nSnap uses Google for most of its heavy lifting today. That might change in five years. While Amazon just provides redundancy for Snapchat to ensure the app doesn't suffer significant downtime right now, it could grow into a much bigger partner for Snap. That's evident by the ramp in minimum obligations.\n\nGoogle still has a big advantage over Amazon. Snap built Snapchat on Google's Cloud Platform. Transition to another cloud provider \"would be difficult to implement, and may cause us to incur significant time and expense,\" it said in its S-1. What's more, Snap built Snapchat using the tools available on Google,\" some of which do not have an alternative in the market,\" according to its prospectus.\n\nBut if Snap wants to expand to China, where Google doesn't operate, it'll have to rework things on another cloud provider, anyway. Considering the growing size of Snap's cloud spending, Amazon may be able to offer tools comparable to what it uses on Google to help facilitate a transition.\n\nGoogle's cloud business is minuscule in comparison to Amazon's. Snap's $400 million per year contract very likely made it Google's biggest cloud customer, and now Amazon's going to steal away a good chunk of its business. That doesn't mean much for Amazon -- its cloud business brought in $12 billion last year -- but it means a whole lot to Google.\n\nWhat this means for Snap\n\nSnap is now committing $3 billion to cloud services over the next five years. That's a lot for a company with only $405 million in annual revenue, even one growing as quickly as Snap.\n\nAt some point, it would make more sense for Snap to build out its own infrastructure like other popular internet services. Building infrastructure is capital intensive, but once it's built, the company would no longer be as reliant on third parties to support its flagship app. With Snap locked into contracts for the next five years, it's unlikely we'll see it go that way anytime soon, which means continued pressure on its gross margin.\n\nLast year, Snap's cost of revenue exceeded sales. The bulk of its cost of revenue was attributed to its cloud infrastructure expenses, which climbed $192 million last year. As such, Snap posted a negative gross margin, which is crazy for a company that primarily produces software.\n\nBy 2021, Snap will be paying at least $750 million for cloud services. That will make it one of the largest cloud-computing customers in the world. With that much committed to Google and Amazon, Snap better get to work on growing its revenue.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

These documents clearly demonstrate that SpaceX is neither profitable nor cash flow positive any longer.\n\nIt's what you may not have heard, though, that will really shock you: SpaceX never planned to earn much profit from launching rockets in the first place. Instead, SpaceX is placing its faith in a megaproject, partially backed by Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , to create a satellite broadband internet constellation, which will encircle the globe, and (as the Journal puts it) \"eventually dwarf [SpaceX's] rocket division.\"\n\nNow, here are five more things you need to know about SpaceX's secret plan for satellite dominance.\n\nLook! Up in the sky! It's not a bird or a plane -- it's how SpaceX hopes to turn profitable. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Tiny satellites, huge profits\n\nWhile most famous today for its rocket launches (and soon to become famous for launching reused rockets, perhaps as soon as this month), SpaceX sees rockets as only a small part of its plans for future profits.\n\nAccording to internal documents dated from 2015, SpaceX hopes to begin putting a constellation of 4,425 broadband internet satellites into orbit in 2018, and begin collecting revenue from it as an internet service provider as early as 2019.\n\n2. Moving the needle\n\nThat year, revenue from satellites will be minuscule -- a few hundred million dollars at most, and probably contributing nothing to profits. Just one year later, however, in 2020, SpaceX expects to get roughly equal amounts of revenue from rocket launches and from satellite internet, about $3 billion each. Profits are expected to leap to $2 billion -- 33% of revenue.\n\n3. Blasting off\n\nAnd this is just the beginning. SpaceX expects its revenue from satellite internet to grow by leaps and bounds from 2020 on, eclipsing revenue from rocket launches in 2021. SpaceX expects that by 2022, satellite revenue will account for roughly 75% of all revenue the company collects, then grow to more than 80% in 2023, and to 85% or more in 2024 and 2025 -- by which time SpaceX expects to be regularly landing astronauts on Mars .\n\n4. Planned obsolescence for rocket launches?\n\nYou might expect that once SpaceX has begun its Mars colonization project, the company would lose interest in the workaday business of merely lofting satellites into Earth orbit -- and you'd be right.\n\nSpaceX's rocket launch plans got knocked off track by its twin SpaceXplosions in 2015 and 2016. But before those plans went askew, the company had mapped out a surprising future for its rocket launch program. Starting off from a base of zero launches in 2011, SpaceX planned to steadily increase the pace of launches through 2019. SpaceX had 27 launches slated for this year, for example. That number would grow to 44 launches in 2018, and then 52 in 2019. But in 2020, satellite launch activity would suddenly reverse course, and fall to just 41 launches.\n\nAt the same time, SpaceX projects modest increases in launch revenue even after 2020. The logical conclusion is that by 2020, what few rockets SpaceX is still launching will be bigger, and more expensive, and will carry bigger, more expensive satellites, too -- just not as many of them.\n\n5. A margin explosion\n\nSo what does all of this mean for SpaceX stock, and for the investors who hope to invest in a possible eventual SpaceX IPO ?\n\nAs we explained last week, SpaceX's internal documents show that even in the best of years, it has been only marginally profitable, and is not profitable at all at present. Introducing reusable rocket launches, as the company plans to do this month, holds the potential to put SpaceX back in the black. But significant profits -- the kind that can finance the colonization of Mars -- will depend on the company's successful deployment and operation of a constellation of broadband internet satellites.\n\nBased on the numbers laid out above, SpaceX appears to be targeting operating profit margins of 33% once its satellites begin operating in 2020. Operating profits could total $4 billion by 2021 (a profit margin of more than 40% on projected revenue of about $9.5 billion). Margins will top 50% by 2022 -- then soar into the mid-50s range in 2023, and finally top out at better than 60% by 2025. At that point, SpaceX expects to be collecting $36 billion in annual revenue -- almost all of it from satellites -- and earning roughly $22 billion in operating profit. To put that final goal in context, $22 billion in profit is 11 times more than the $1 billion in revenue that SpaceX collected in 2014, its best revenue year ever.\n\nLogical conclusion: If SpaceX can bring its broadband satellite internet project to fruition, SpaceX stock could turn out to be a very profitable investment. But if you're planning to invest in SpaceX, you need to do it for the satellite business (which doesn't exist yet), and not for the rocket launch business that does exist.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares)\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

( F ) announced that it is investing $1 billion during the next five years in Argo AI to develop a virtual driver system for Ford's autonomous vehicle coming in 2021 - and for potential license to other companies.\n\nThe company said that the $1 billion investment in Argo AI will be made over five years and is consistent with the autonomous vehicle capital allocation plan shared last September as part of Ford Investor Day.\n\nBy the end of this year, Argo AI expects to have more than 200 team members, based in the company's Pittsburgh headquarters and at major sites in Southeastern Michigan and the Bay Area of California.\n\nFounded by former Google and Uber leaders, Argo AI will include roboticists and engineers from inside and outside of Ford working to develop a new software platform for Ford's fully autonomous vehicle coming in 2021.\n\nArgo AI founders Bryan Salesky, the company's chief executive, and Peter Rander, chief operating officer, led the self-driving car teams of Alphabet Inc. ( GOOGL ) and Uber, Ford said.\n\n\"Argo AI's agility and Ford's scale uniquely combine the benefits of a technology startup with the experience and discipline of the automaker's industry-leading autonomous vehicle development program,\" Ford said in a statement. Ford last year announced plans to sell driverless cars by 2021 and unveiled partnerships and investments in the arena, as well as buying a San Francisco-based shuttle startup.\n\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\n\nhttp://www.rttnews.com\n\nThis article appears in: Politics , Stocks , Stocks", "Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) announced on Friday that it is acquiring a majority stake in artificial-intelligence start-up Argo AI for $1 billion, to be paid over five years.\n\nWhat is Argo AI?\n\nArgo AI is a new company, founded late last year by CEO Bryan Salesky and COO Peter Rander. Both are big names in self-driving circles: Salesky was the head of hardware at Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Waymo unit (formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project); Rander was a top engineer in Uber Technologies' autonomous-vehicle division. Both were previously at the robotics institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where they worked on artificial-intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nThe plan for Argo AI is to use the founders' expertise in AI to develop autonomous-vehicle software. The company is headquartered in Pittsburgh. It's small now, but it expects to have more than 200 employees by the end of 2017.\n\nArgo COO Peter Rander (left), Ford CEO Mark Fields, Argo CEO Brian Salesky, and Ford CTO Raj Nair. Image source: Ford Motor Company.\n\nWhat Ford said about the deal\n\nFord said that Argo AI \"is bringing together some of the most experienced roboticists and engineers working in autonomy from inside and outside of Ford.\" An existing Ford team that has been working on what Ford calls its \"virtual driver system,\" the brain of an autonomous vehicle, will become part of Argo AI.\n\nWhile Ford will continue to develop its self-driving hardware in-house, it appears that Argo AI will be responsible for much of the software development. That software could be licensed to other companies, CEO Mark Fields said, and it's possible that Argo AI will go public at some point.\n\n\"The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago,\" Fields said. \"As Ford expands to be an auto and a mobility company, we believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future.\"\n\nFord will hold a majority stake in the new company. Fields wouldn't say exactly what Ford's ownership percentage will be, but he did say that it was gauged to leave plenty of room to provide equity compensation to new employees.\n\nFord's global product chief and CTO, Raj Nair, and group vice president of global strategy, John Casesa, will hold two of the five seats on Argo AI's board. Salesky and Rander will hold two more, and the fifth will go to an independent director to be named later.\n\nInvestors, take note: Fields said that Argo AI's spending and results will be consolidated into Ford's automotive financial results, primarily in the North America region.\n\nWhat this deal is really about\n\nHere's how I'm thinking about this deal: Ford just hired two rock stars in AI and autonomous vehicles, put them in charge of its self-driving software team, and structured the whole thing to give the team members -- and very importantly, future hires, in a field in which the competition for talent is fierce -- the upside of a start-up with lower risk, because Ford's investment has essentially capitalized the company and Ford will be its first customer. It's an intriguing idea; it could turn out to be a brilliant one.\n\nDuring a conference call for analysts and media, Salesky emphasized that the structure of what he called the \"collaboration\" between Argo AI and Ford would help recruiting: New hires (and Ford's existing virtual-driver team) will go to work for a start-up with significant potential upside, not (directly, at least) for giant Ford.\n\nAnd while it's a start-up, Ford's involvement means that new hires can be assured that Argo AI has both solid funding and a major customer. The combination of relatively low risk with high potential upside should make for a potent recruiting tool in a field where the competition for talent has been extremely fierce.\n\nThe upshot: An intriguing move to boost Ford's technology push\n\nFor Ford, this is a way to bring some deep AI expertise into its self-driving development project, structured in a way that will help boost its recruiting efforts going forward. Nair said that he doesn't expect the deal to \"accelerate\" Ford's effort -- he stuck by the previously announced 2021 deadline for Ford's first mass-produced self-driving vehicle.\n\nBut there's a clear advantage to putting the team under the leadership of Salesky and Rander, in a company that offers the upside of a start-up with less risk than most. We'll have to wait to learn more about the structure of the deal to evaluate it fully, but right now it looks like Ford has taken an intriguing step ahead.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Ford\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Now supports are once again firming up both off and on the price chart for GOOGL stock. And for shorter-term investors, a bullishly targeted butterfly is one way to position and capture a nice profit range with limited risk in lieu of owning shares of Alphabet.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhen it comes to large-cap tech outfits like Alphabet, political risks ranging from China to net neutrality to immigration laws remain a question mark. But waiting on a resolution is like waiting on Godot.\n\nIt may take a while. As well, those eventual outcomes could always prove beneficial to GOOGL.\n\nOf course, there are also the potential political supports, such as cash repatriation and favorable corporate tax cuts, to consider. Not only is passage of such legislation more popular and likely easier to push through Congress, it would certainly be a boon for Alphabet.\n\nWhat's more, GOOGL stock is looking great again after its recent earnings report. Bottom line, earnings missed but growth is back. With its Q4 results, Alphabet proved its business focuses outside the company's bread-and-butter advertising search revenues, are starting to pay-off for the company.\n\nFor one, mobile search and YouTube both showed strong results and helped with Alphabet's overall \"exceptional\" year-over-year sales growth of 24%.\n\nBut newer investments are also coming into their own. The company's aggressive shift into hardware such as its Pixel smartphone, AI-enhanced Home and virtual reality helped Alphabet grow its \"other revenues\" by more than 62% on sales of $3.4 billion.\n\nGOOGL Stock Daily Chart\n\nAway from Alphabet's overall bullish narrative off the price chart, GOOGL stock is showing technical support for a long stake by investors.\n\nFollowing a fairly stiff post-earnings bout of profit-taking from brief all-time-highs, Alphabet has managed to find support from a Fibonacci zone, key price pivot dating back to last February's high, as well as the intermediate-term, 50-day simple moving average.\n\nLooking forward, targeting the post-earnings high of $867 appears logical. At roughly 4% from current prices, but with no overt company-specific catalysts on the immediate horizon to push GOOGL shares aggressively higher, I like the idea of using a targeted long butterfly spread.\n\nGOOGL Stock Bullish Call Butterfly Spread\n\nTiming is everything. This is especially true with options strategies as calls and puts are wasting assets. Our last discussion on Alphabet options is intimately aware of this, as a lower-risk, bullishly placed long butterfly literally expired one day and $1 dollar short of cleaning up.\n\nI suppose you could say the last trade got trumped.\n\nNevertheless, in looking at Alphabet's options and given what has been addressed, the GOOGL March $845/$860/$875 is attractive.\n\nWith GOOGL trading at $833, the out-of-the-money and bullishly placed butterfly is priced for $2.20 per spread, or less than one-third of one percent of the GOOGL stock price. A maximum profit of $12.80 or return approaching 600% would occur if GOOGL rallied by 3.25% over the next month and landed on the sold center strike $860 call at expiration.\n\nThe desired and very precise outcome for maximizing returns is not a high-probability event by any stretch. However, with its limited risk, profit range from roughly $847 to $873 and maybe the use of a 50% stop loss in the event profit-taking turns into something more ominous, a GOOGL stock butterfly looks well positioned for the situation.\n\nInvestment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any of the securities or their derivatives mentioned in this article.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock. The trade yielded almost $5 in pure profits. I gained $3 from my debit call spread appreciation and $2 from selling the naked put.\n\nNow Apple stock sits near its all-time highs making it difficult to recommend an entry point. Furthermore, other mega-caps like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) or Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have more obvious entry points.\n\nSo is it too late to set another long trade in AAPL? I don't think so; there is still time to set another trade using options for another potential run of free profits.\n\nFundamentally, Apple stock still is a money printing machine with a rosy intermediate outlook. I have my concerns about its leadership though; I strongly believe that Tim Cook will ruin Apple, but not in the next few months. Meanwhile, and if markets in general don't suffer a sustained correction this year, AAPL should be higher through 2017.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge Technically, AAPL has a few constructive points. First, it made a wide rounding bottom rejecting the last swoon.\n\nAlso, I think that if Apple stock sets a new high it would invite more frantic buyers who were leery of the potential of another double top.\n\nThe Trade: Buy the AAPL April debit $135/$140 call spread. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $1.40 per contract to open. If Apple rallies well past my spread, I stand to triple my money. The price I pay to open the trade is the maximum I could lose. Usually I like to lower my exposure. In this case, I want to sell downside risk premium to finance the purchase of my calls or more. It's difficult to do so near all-time-high levels, but not impossible.\n\nThe Bank: Sell the AAPL Jan 2018 $105 put. This also is a bullish trade for which I collect $3 per contract to open. By selling naked puts I am committing to buying the stock at the strike sold if Apple stock falls below it. But even if that bad scenario unfolds, I would have bought the stock at a 20% discount from today's levels. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success.\n\nAs long as AAPL stock stays above my put sold, any premium I collect from selling my debit call spread can be pure profit. So if price action becomes too bearish, I could sell back the debit call spread for a profit even if the price I get is lower than my entry price.\n\nI am not required to hold my trades through their expiration dates. I can close either at any time for partial gains or losses.\n\nNicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com .

(AAPL) Stock, But Love This Trade appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Nvidia (Shutterstock photo)\n\nIt's no secret that Nvidia (NVDA) was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2016, gaining more than 370%. But while the company's graphics processor unit (GPU) chips are being used in everything from gaming PCs to autonomous cars to virtual reality to data centers, the reinvigoration of Nvidia is built by one thing: artificial intelligence.\n\nAI is increasingly being used in everything and everywhere, most notably data centers for machine learning, where Nvidia's GPUs have a tremendous lead over the competition, including anything from AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Data center revenue was up 67% year-over-year in the quarter at $296 million and more impressive, up 23% from the impressive fiscal third-quarter 2017 results that helped send the stock soaring more than 30% in November 2016.\n\nThe technology is touching everything and anyone, be it on your smartphone or when you shop on Amazon (AMZN) or using software. In fact, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang told Barron's that AI is just the future of software.\n\nIf you read Nvidia's conference call transcript and its earnings press release, AI is mentioned everywhere and with good reason: deep learning is only made possible by the advancements in AI being made by university researchers and big companies such as Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon and others.\n\nIn reacting to the blow-out earnings results, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis called Nvidia essentially the only publicly traded company solely focused on AI. \"[Nvidia] posted its 7th consecutive beat, and while YoY rev growth of 55% likely marks 2nd derivative peak, the 200% growth in its Datacenter business and improving GM reinforce our thesis that NVDA is emerging as the de facto standard in AI - one of the most exciting growth drivers in tech,\" Lipacis wrote, while raising his price target to $140 from $125.\n\nOf the aforementioned areas, perhaps the one that is most tangible to show consumers the AI revolution is autonomous driving.\n\nTesla (TSLA) and CEO Elon Musk have pioneered autonomous driving in the Model S (though to which extent is up for debate), but Tesla has chosen to use Nvidia's chipsets to not only help it with its infotainment unit, but more importantly, the software that helps with autonomy, using the NVIDIA DRIVE™ PX 2 AI computing platform.\n\nSociety is a little bit away from true autonomy in a car (Level 5), in which a human does not need to do anything, but Tesla is working on getting towards Level 4/5 faster than anyone else, thanks to Nvidia. (For a good primer on what each level means, click here.)\n\nNvidia has several other automotive partnerships, including recently announced ones with Bosch and Audi.\n\nAll of this highlights that self-driving cars is not just a science fiction fantasy, it's real and it's coming. And it's being powered by AI. The societal impact AI will have is up for debate, whether it will be a net positive or a net negative, but there is no stopping it.\n\nAI is continuing to become more prevalent in everything we do, but we are nowhere near general AI, in which computers can make decisions just as a human can. What we're experiencing right now is soft (weak) AI, in which humans tell a computer to do a task and it does it better than any human can. But thanks to deep/machine learning, we're getting closer to general AI, even if it's still decades away. That means the AI revolution is only just getting started and it has years and years on which to run.\n\nAll thanks to Nvidia." ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.3834435261707989, 0.4667173971861472, 0.4705083443126921, 0.4559184459608185, 0.4804858416777019, 0.4414299242424242, 0.4424763613579402, 0.4222601794340923, 0.4434505431675243, 0.4842392822231532 ], "headline" : [ "Apple Shares Closed At New All-time High", "Alphabet Inc – Is Google Assistant Going Everywhere?

But what about Google's big advantage over Amazon in the smart home war - all those smartphones?\n\nSource: Google\n\nThe company has just begun rolling out Home Control, a new feature that lets Google Assistant control smart home devices by voice.\n\nHowever, at this point, Home Control - like Google Assistant - remains a feature that's exclusive to Google's own Pixel Phones.\n\nThe Battle for the Smart Home\n\nGoogle Home is a connected speaker with Google Assistant baked in. Owners can use Google Assistant on the speaker to answer questions, find music and control a growing number of smart home devices using their voice only.\n\nThe device is GOOGL's answer to the Amazon Echo. Amazon's Alexa-enabled speaker has been a surprise hit and allowed Amazon to take a big lead in the race to become the smart home hub - despite the distinct disadvantage of lacking a smartphone platform to host its digital assistant.\n\nGoogle has Google Now and the new Google Assistant, while Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has Siri. Between them, the two companies have billions of mobile devices in consumers' hands, yet Amazon still managed to leapfrog them with its personal assistant hosted in a speaker, to build an impressive smart home lead.\n\nApple's Siri can control HomeKit-compatible smart home devices using voice commands, and now GOOGL is rolling out a similar feature for its Google Assistant, Home Control .\n\nHome Control\n\nGoogle's new feature for voice control of smart devices isn't actually new. Anyone who owns both a Pixel Phone and a Google Home speaker already had a Home Control setting on their smartphone.\n\nHowever, as of yesterday, GOOGL has begun to roll out Home Control to all Google Assistant users. This amounts to all Pixel Phone owners, since Google Assistant remains an exclusive that third-party Android smartphones don't get.\n\nWith Home Control, someone with a Pixel Phone gets the same voice control ability for smart devices they would have if they owned a Google Home speaker. They can use voice commands on their phone to change the temperature on their Nest Learning Thermostat or turn off the smart lighting in the room they just left.\n\nThe Battle for the Smart Home Enters a New Phase (Sort of)\n\nAt the start of this fight to be the company that becomes the hub of the smart home - the one who controls all those smart devices - the smartphone was it.\n\nSmartphones ran all the apps that controlled each of the devices and everyone owned one. With smartphones, the battle came down to iOS and Android, Apple and Google.\n\nThen Amazon disrupted everything with the Echo and Alexa. With thousands of compatible products and services, consumers have been snapping them up. Amazon sold out of the Echo at Christmas, after selling nine times more of the smart speaker than the previous year.\n\nVoice control is in. Having to poke buttons on a smartphone is out.\n\nHowever, Apple and Google are not about to cede the smart home to Amazon. GOOGL began its assault on Amazon with the Google Home smart speaker to directly take on the Echo and Alexa. With Home Control, it's bringing voice control of smart devices to the smartphone, leveraging its massive lead over Amazon when it comes to numbers. There may be millions of Alexa-powered homes, but there are billions of people already carrying an Android smartphone.\n\nExcept, most of those people still won't be able to use Home Control. GOOGL has baked Home Control into Google Assistant, a feature that's been exclusive to its Pixel Phones since they were released last fall. With Google Home and now Home Control, Alphabet clearly has Amazon's number. The question will be whether Amazon gets Alexa into more third-party devices before Google decides to let third-party Android smartphone makers have access to Google Assistant.\n\nFor GOOGL, the decision comes down to which is more valuable: maintaining a key competitive advantage for its own Pixel Phones, or giving up that Google Assistant and Home Control exclusivity to take a real shot at unseating Amazon in the smart home.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Alphabet Inc. Takes Another Shot at Amazon With Home Control appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Nvidia earnings (Shutterstock photo)\n\nIt appears the only thing now strong enough to stop Nvidia (NVDA) stock from climbing higher are investors’ expectations. Thanks to the company’s advancements in cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI), NVDA shares have soared some 340% over the past year, crushing every important index.\n\nAs such, the California-based semiconductor giant had lot to prove Thursday. And with top- and bottom-line numbers that cruised by even the most bullish forecasts, Nvidia answered the call. But the shares appear muted, falling as much as 3% in the after-hour session. From my vantage point, this decline, which I consider inconsequential, is victory for Nvidia and its investors. I’ll get back to that in a moment.\n\nLet’s go though the numbers.\n\nIn the three months that ended December, Nvidia reported net a income of $655 million, or 99 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings came to $1.30 per share, which beat consensus estimates by a whopping 30 cents. Fourth quarter revenue also beat, coming in 55% higher year over year to $2.17 billion. The Street was looking for revenue of $2.11 billion.\n\nThe strong bottom-line beat was driven by record quarterly GAAP gross margin at 60.0%, the company said, while non-GAAP gross margin at 60.2%. When looking back at fiscal 2016, the company broke several of its own records, including full-year revenue of $6.91 billion, which grew 38% from a year ago.\n\n\"We had a great finish to a record year, with continued strong growth across all our businesses,\" said CEO Jen-Hsun Huang in a statement. \"Our GPU computing platform is enjoying rapid adoption in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles. Huang also added that Nvidia’s deep learning GPUs (graphical processing units) has made a breakthrough approach to AI, which can now help in early cancer detection, weather prediction and is helping to tackle challenges such as self-driving cars.\n\nAll told, it is these breakthrough areas that continue to drive interest in NVDA stock. Admittedly, I wasn’t a believer until now. And while the tech battle has always been between Apple (AAPL) Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), those guys are not alone anymore.\n\nIn terms of the 3% decline on these solid numbers? Nvidia is being shown the respect it now deserves. Even if the stock were to decline 5% to 10% — after a 340% one-year rise — it would still imply the momentum story is still in place. And Nvidia’s Q1 outlook for revenue to be $1.9 billion, which surpass Wall Street estimates of $1.88 billion, suggests it sees no signs of slowing down.", "InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA report began circulating several days ago that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) may start production of the iPhone 8 early. Typically, when a company starts manufacturing sooner than usual, that points to an accelerated release date for a new product.\n\nSource: Apple\n\nIn this case, it seems unlikely the move will result in an iPhone release date before Apple's standard September launch.\n\nIf not to get it on shelves sooner, why would the company want to get an early start on new iPhone production?\n\nThe iPhone 8 Early Production Ramp Up\n\nApple has a pretty standard roadmap when it comes to new iPhone releases. With a late September iPhone release date, the company starts to ramp up production of the new model in late summer. However, this year it looks as though Apple may be breaking with tradition.\n\nAccording to a report from BlueFin Research Partners, there are indicators in the company's supply chain that point to an unusually early production ramp up for the iPhone 8. Quoted in MSN Money , the BlueFin report notes :\n\n\"The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that Apple is ramping the next generation iPhones earlier than historical norms.\"\n\nWhy Early Production Won't Lead to an Earlier iPhone Release Date\n\nBefore anyone gets too excited about the possibility of an early iPhone 8 release, that scenario is highly unlikely.\n\nFirst, ramping up production in June means Apple will begin having stock of the new iPhones in warehouses by the summer. But no one releases a flagship smartphone during the summer months - that's a slow time for consumer technology news. People are on vacation and not only would an iPhone announcement not get the coverage Apple expects for its new product launches, with so many people away the line-ups at Apple Stores the company is hoping for wouldn't happen.\n\nAn early release would also reduce iPhone 7 sales. Now that production is humming on that model, Apple wouldn't want to kneecap it by releasing the iPhone 8 early.\n\nSo Why Would Apple Ramp up iPhone 8 Production Early?\n\nIt's become increasingly obvious that companies like Apple are pushing the limits of their supply chain and manufacturing partners with their latest smartphones. The new dual camera system, haptic Home button and other components led to a shortage of some iPhone 7 models at launch. Apple ramped up production in late summer as usual, but these issues caused delays .\n\nI preordered an iPhone 7 Plus, but still waited a month after the new iPhones went on sale before mine was available …\n\nThen there's the issue of batteries. Apple has had to face its own headaches with iPhone 6 and 6s batteries , but those problems pale in comparison to the nightmare rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) has gone through with the Galaxy Note 7 and its exploding batteries.\n\nThere's a lot riding on the iPhone 8 and Apple appears to be throwing all sorts of new features, cutting-edge technology and a completely new design at its 10th anniversary iPhone. Glass construction, wireless charging, an OLED display, virtual Home button and more. The company is even rumored to be charging $1,000-plus for its new flagship, an unprecedented price for a smartphone.\n\nIn addition, Samsung will likely be introducing its new Galaxy Note around the same time, and pulling out all the stops to make that phablet such a smash hit that everyone forgets about the Galaxy Note 7. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is also expected to release the followup to the worryingly successful Google Pixel Phone in the fall.\n\nRather than ramping up for an early launch, it's far more likely that Apple is starting iPhone 8 production early in order to iron out all the manufacturing bugs early. Virtually all of the components will be new and Apple will undoubtedly be pushing the limits of manufacturing capability. Having an early start will ensure any issues are caught well before the iPhone 8 goes on sale, ensuring a smooth, scandal-free, launch. And no embarrassing issues for the competition to take advantage of.\n\nThe early ramp up also ensures that even if things don't go smoothly at first, there will be plenty of iPhone 8 smartphones sitting in Apple warehouses in September, ensuring a record-setting launch.\n\nDespite the apparent early production ramp up, don't expect an iPhone release date in the summer. But Apple's move does mean you should have a flawless iPhone 8 in your hands at the launch, instead of waiting weeks or months for supply to catch up to demand.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post No, Apple Inc.

It satirizes \"post-racial\" America and focuses on underlying racism in American universities. It tells about the experience of a group of ethnically diverse students at a prestigious, majority white Ivy League college.\n\nBut the trailer received a backlash with Twitter users accusing Netflix of \"glorifying Anti-White racism\" and calling for a boycott of the streaming service using the hashtag \"#BoycottNetflix.\" On YouTube, the trailer had a huge number of downvotes, compared to a small number of upvotes.\n\n\"I think what pisses people off is seeing a woman of color refer to white people en masse. Something she'd not dare be allowed in decades past,\" Simien added.\n\nNetflix has described the series in a press release and said, \"Through an absurdist lens, Dear White People utilizes biting irony, self-deprecation and sometimes brutal honesty to hold up a mirror to the issues plaguing society today, all the while leading with laughter.\"\n\nThe original film first gained traction in 2012 with a concept trailer. By 2014, the crowd funded movie made a splash at film festivals, earning the U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Breakthrough Talent at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. However, the film received no backlash at that time.\n\nIn May 2016, Netflix had said it will stream a comedy series based on the film, with the series to be produced by Lionsgate.

For the full year, its net income surged over 300% to $2.4 billion.\n\nThat incredible growth was mostly attributed to the rapid growth of AWS' high-margin business, which gives Amazon much more freedom to expand its e-commerce ecosystem with low-margin hardware like its Echo speakers, loss-leading services like Amazon Video and Prime Now, and logistics solutions like new fulfillment centers and drones.\n\n2. AWS' operating margin of 26%\n\nAWS finished last quarter with an operating margin of 26%, compared to 24% in the year-ago quarter. That margin expansion indicates that AWS' massive scale is offsetting tough price competition across the cloud platform market, which caused Amazon and its rivals to reduce their prices throughout the year.\n\n3. AWS' annual run rate of $14 billion\n\nAmazon announced that AWS had achieved an annual run rate of $14 billion, indicating that it maintains a commanding lead over Microsoft 's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure in the cloud platform race.\n\nMicrosoft claimed that its \"commercial cloud\" had achieved an annual run rate of over $14 billion last quarter, but most of that total came from SaaS platforms like Office 365 and Dynamics CRM. Azure -- which competes directly against AWS in the IaaS/PaaS \"cloud platform\" markets -- accounts for a much smaller percentage.\n\nMicrosoft doesn't disclose how much revenue Azure generates, but combining earlier industry estimates and its reported growth rate over the past few quarters indicates that its annual run rate could be around $3 billion.\n\n4. Over 1,000 new AWS features\n\nAmazon already serves massive customers like NASA, the CDC, and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) with AWS, but it's continuously widening the platform's competitive moat against rival platforms like Azure with new features. Amazon added over 1,000 new features and services to AWS in fiscal 2016, compared to about 700 in 2015.\n\nIt also opened eleven new AWS Availability Zones across five geographic regions in 2016, bringing AWS' total coverage to 42 Availability Zones across 16 regions globally. That massive data center expansion will help AWS reach more companies and developers, all while supporting the expansion of its e-commerce and digital ecosystem into new markets.\n\n5. Prime Video in over 200 countries\n\nA big part of that digital ecosystem expansion is Prime Video, the company's streaming answer to Netflix. Amazon has made the platform a \"free\" perk for Prime subscribers and a stand-alone subscription service that costs slightly less than Netflix.\n\nLike Netflix, Amazon is investing heavily in original content, and popular shows like Transparent and Man in the High Castle helped it become the third largest video streaming platform in the U.S. after YouTube and Netflix last year, according to research firm Sandvine. Amazon is also following Netflix's lead and investing heavily in localized original content in key markets like Japan and India, which could help expand its Prime user base worldwide.\n\n6. 4,000 new skills for Alexa\n\nAmazon also taught its voice recognition platform Alexa 4,000 new skills since last October. It noted that \"tens of thousands of developers\" are building new skills for the platform -- which powers the Echo, Kindle, and Fire TV devices -- and that it was working with \"a lot of major companies\" to integrate their products with that ecosystem.\n\nThe expansion of the Alexa ecosystem is important, because it can give Amazon control of users' connected homes via Dash buttons, DRS-enabled appliances, and other connected devices. In addition to boosting its e-commerce revenue with \"frictionless\" orders, that platform can process data through AWS and widen its moat in the smart home race against Alphabet 's Google, which is trying to establish its own home-based ecosystem around its Home smart speaker.\n\nThe key takeaway\n\nAmazon's fourth quarter report was lumpy, but investors shouldn't overlook these positive numbers. Analysts still expect Amazon's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 22% and 53% next year -- so its overall growth won't peak anytime soon. Therefore, I believe that investors should take advantage of Amazon's temporary swoon and pick up a few more shares for the long term.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Companies often modify their initial registration statements leading up to their IPOs, prior to issuing a formal prospectus. Prospective investors already knew that Snap is a big spender at Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Cloud, which it relies on for its cloud infrastructure needs.\n\nSnap is unique in its continued use of third-party infrastructure vendors at the scale at which it is operating ; most companies invest in their own infrastructure once they grow to a point where it's warranted. To a lesser extent, Snap also purchases infrastructure services from Amazon.com 's(NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nIn the amended filing, Snap provided some additional detail on its relationship with the e-commerce giant.\n\nAlways have a contingency plan\n\nTo be clear, Google Cloud is still Snap's main flame, but it never hurts to have backup. In fact, contingency planning is absolutely critical when your entire service relies on third-party infrastructure partners, and this is the role that AWS will play. The deal was inked just yesterday, which is what's triggering the S-1 amendment.\n\nIn last week's version, Snap said: \"We are currently negotiating an agreement with another cloud provider for redundant infrastructure support of our business operations.\" That line was replaced in this week's version with: \"We have also committed to spend $1 billion with Amazon Web Services over the next five years for redundant infrastructure support of our business operations.\" Snap says an existing agreement with AWS that was originally entered into in March 2016 was amended on Feb. 8, 2017.\n\nThat $1 billion commitment will slowly ramp up, starting with $50 million in spending this year. That's a tiny drop in the bucket compared to the $12.2 billion in sales that AWS did in 2016. Snap is on the hook to spend $350 million with AWS in 2021. In contrast, the agreement with Google Cloud that was finalized on Jan. 30, 2017 calls for a flat $400 million per year for five years, with a little bit of leeway in shifting spending to subsequent years (up to 15% in each of the first four years).\n\nData source: Snapchat amended S-1. Chart by author.\n\nCombined with its $2 billion commitment with Google Cloud, we're looking at $3 billion pledged between Google Cloud and AWS over the next five years. Snap's cloud strategy of relying entirely on third-party partners is risky for many operational reasons, but that's an awful lot of financial pressure for the start-up. In 2016, cost of revenue exceeded revenue, resulting in a negative gross profit of nearly $50 million, and infrastructure costs are the largest component of cost of revenue.\n\nSnap only recently rolled out its automated ad sales API in October, which exited beta just a couple weeks ago. The company will now need to ramp ad sales faster than its infrastructure spending commitments if it hopes to generate gross profit in the years ahead. And we haven't even started talking about operating expenses yet, which totaled $473 million last year.\n\nHopefully, that API works pretty darn well.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .", "One of the many interesting details revealed in Snap 's S-1 filing with the SEC is that it agreed to a $2 billion contract with Google Cloud in January. The agreement with the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary spans five years with relatively equal payments scheduled for every year.\n\nSnap has used Google Cloud since its creation, but had been spending considerably less than the $400 million per year it's slated to spend through 2021. For the first few years of its existence, it spent less than $30 million per year on Google Cloud. Last year, however, it started seeing its hosting costs increase considerably, up $192 million for the year.\n\nImage Source: Getty\n\nGoogle's cloud service competes against the larger Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure. A $2 billion infusion could help it catch up to the competition.\n\nWhat does $2 billion mean to Google Cloud?\n\nAlphabet isn't exactly forthright with its cloud revenue. It lumps Google Cloud in with Google's other revenue line item, which also includes Google Play and hardware sales. In 2016, the three categories produced $10.1 billion in revenue. Google Play likely accounts for the bulk of revenue.\n\nThe cloud unit had an estimated run rate of just $1 billion as of the end of 2015, according to RBC Capital. Snap's new contract likely makes it Google's biggest cloud customer.\n\nWhile Google has made several advancements in its cloud services over the past year, so have its competitors. Microsoft boasted that its Azure revenue increased 93% last quarter, but Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss estimates the unit brought in just $1.6 billion. Bernstein's Mark Mordler estimates Azure's run rate at $3 billion as of last quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon just reported AWS sales topped $12 billion in 2016. Sales surpassed $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter alone, although that fell short of analysts expectations.\n\nGoogle still needs to diversify\n\nThe growth of Snapchat has been a major boon to Google's cloud services, but it's still actively seeking to pull customers away from its competitors and take market share. The hiring of cloud-computing veteran Diane Greene to lead the division has helped the company attract numerous high-profile customers, but there's still more work to do.\n\nOn Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said, \"We have truly differentiated offerings in four key areas: data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy, tools for application development, and the ability to create connected business platforms.\" Snap can take advantage of at least three of those four factors, so it's clear why it was willing to lock down a long-term contract.\n\nAt the same time, the contract is not exclusive. If Snap wants to enter China, for example, where Google doesn't operate, it could tap one of Google's competitors. Or it could build its own servers.\n\nSnap recently hired Jerry Hunter from AWS, who ran global data centers for the cloud-computing giant. In Snap's S-1 filing, management notes, \"In the future, we may invest in building our own infrastructure to better serve our customers.\"\n\nIf Snap continues to grow at the pace it has been for the last few years, it may make economic sense for it to switch to its own cloud infrastructure, which would be a huge blow for Google.\n\nWhat this means for Snap\n\nSnap is now on the hook for $400 million per year in cloud costs. There is some wiggle room: The contract says it can postpone up to 15% of expenses for a year, so it only has to spend $340 million this first year. Still, that's a huge amount for a company that generated just $404.5 million in revenue last year.\n\nIt also means that switching service providers will be difficult, considering it would either have to eat the contract as a loss, or leave at least some of its operations on Google Cloud in order not to waste the money. That makes the economics of building out its own infrastructure within the next five years even costlier.\n\nOn the flip side, analysts expect Snap's revenue to continue growing at a rapid pace, approaching $1 billion this year fueled by continued user growth and product expansion that will surely put additional demands on Google's servers. It has plenty of capital to cover the expense, and if last year's growth is any indication of what to expect, it will need to spend at least $340 million on cloud infrastructure this year. The deal with Google ensures that it gets the lowest rates possible, so it can to make the most of its spend.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad deal for Snap, but it does tie the company to Google for a long time.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares)\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Along with the new OS, which incorporates advanced features like Google Assistant, new Google smartwatch hardware was announced. Made in partnership with LG , the new devices are premium quality, made to take full advantage of Android Wear 2.0 and ready to take on the Apple Watch.\n\nSource: Google\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nGoogle knows it didn't exactly hit the ball out of the park when it first released its Android Wear smartwatch OS. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has dominated the smartwatch market since its release and despite an overall cooling for smartwatches in general, it looks as though Apple Watch absolutely destroyed the competition over Christmas .\n\nThat has to be especially galling to Google, considering the Apple Watch is only compatible with iPhones, while Android Wear smartwatches work with nearly 90% of the smartphones being sold today. And while Apple Watch remains locked into a clunky square watch face, Android Wear supports the traditional, round wristwatch look.\n\nAndroid Wear 2.0 Key Features\n\nGoogle was originally supposed to release Android Wear 2.0 last September, but decided to delay it to this spring . The official announcement landed yesterday afternoon on GOOGL's blog.\n\nWhat did Google engineers spend the extra time working on? It appears that they had several major goals: improving on the basic features most smartwatch owners use (such as fitness tracking), cutting the cord to a smartphone with LTE support, and making Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches as compatible as possible with the iPhone.\n\nKey features Google is showing off include:\n\nImproved fitness tracking with Google Fit app\n\nLTE support for running apps and making voice calls directly from a smartwatch without requiring connection to a smartphone\n\nGoogle Assistant is integrated\n\nCustomizable watch face components\n\nGoogle Play access direct from smartwatch\n\nSupport for hardware control similar to Apple Watch digital crown\n\nIn particular, the ability for more apps to run independently on Android Wear 2.0 devices - with no need to be connected to a smartwatch - means iPhone users will get almost the same experience as Android phone owners. Assuming GOOGL can convince them to skip the Apple Watch.\n\nNew Google Smartwatch Is From LG\n\nRumors had been flying that alongside the new operating system, the first Google smartwatch would make an appearance. That made sense considering GOOGL's push into branded hardware with the Google Pixel Phone and devices like Google Home and Google WiFi.\n\nHowever, the two new smartwatches unveiled as part of the announcement are from LG, in collaboration with GOOGL.\n\nThe LG Watch Style is a relatively basic model. It lacks advanced capabilities like GPS (or even a heart rate monitor), but delivers smartwatch features in a slim, traditional wristwatch form factor. The round display is a 1.2-inch OLED screen at 360 x 360 pixel resolution and the watch has all-day battery life. It comes with a leather strap and for an extra $30, a Rose Gold color option.\n\nThe LG Watch Style is the bigger and more capable device, fully able to take full advantage of all Android Wear 2.0's new features. The 1.38-inch P-OLED display has a crisp 480 x 480 pixel resolution. The round frame is stainless steel, with IP68 water resistance. There's a heart rate monitor and GPS for fitness, Connectivity includes Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, LTE and NFC for Android Pay. Battery life is rated for all-day, but use of features like LTE and the heart rate monitor can significantly cut that.\n\nThey're premium devices, designed to take on the Apple Watch and GOOGL's involvement means they make the most of Android Wear 2.0. But they aren't the official Google smartwatch … well see if that comes later.\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\nGoogle says Android Wear 2.0 will begin rolling out \"in the coming weeks.\" Most current Android Wear smartwatches should be eligible for the free update, but not all watches will support all features. The LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport will retail for $249 and $349 respectively and will go on sale in the U.S. starting Feb. 10.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Finally Fires Back at Apple With Android Wear 2.0 appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "A small line item on Amazon.com 's(NASDAQ: AMZN) balance sheet has been growing rapidly over the past couple years. Since the end of 2014, Amazon's unearned revenue liability increased from $1.8 billion to $4.8 billion. Some investors might see a growing liability and think that's bad news, but in fact this is very good news.\n\nUnearned revenue is simply cash customers have paid to Amazon in advance for services it has yet to render. For example, Prime members typically pay $99 up front for a full year of the two-day shipping program. Amazon immediately takes the cash and puts it on its balance sheet, but it amortizes the $99 of revenue over the 12 months of the membership. So it accounts for only $8.25 per month in revenue per month for each Prime member. The rest of the cash received for Prime is held in the unearned-revenue balance.\n\nPrime growth has been very good over the past few years. Amazon says it added \"tens of millions\" of new members last year. But Prime isn't the biggest driver of unearned revenue. More likely, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the biggest factor pushing the balance higher.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nMaybe last quarter wasn't so disappointing\n\nFor the first time since Amazon started breaking out AWS revenue and income, the cloud-computing segment missed analysts' expectations. Sales totaled $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter, where analysts were expecting $3.6 billion on average.\n\nBut unearned revenue climbed $568 million from the previous quarter. That's unusual for Amazon's fourth quarter. Usually, unearned revenue spikes in the first quarter as cloud customers presumably re-up short-term contracts for the year.\n\nMost of Amazon's AWS customers are small businesses using its pay-as-you-go pricing, which allows them to quickly scale their use. The solution works well for companies with small or unpredictable user bases.\n\nBut a lot of AWS's money comes from the big enterprises that spend hundreds of millions every year on cloud computing. For those companies, with more predictable usage needs, Amazon offers \"reserved instances,\" which offers a discount if customers pay up front. Growth in reserved instances, or other long-term contracts, may have resulted in lower revenue in the short term, but it nearly guaranteed revenue in the future.\n\nLocking in customers\n\nAs the competition for cloud-computing infrastructure continues to heat up, long-term contracts may prove invaluable. Locking in customers for a relatively long term means those enterprises will start optimizing their code so that it runs more efficiently on the specific hardware and platform they're using.\n\nSuch is the case with Snap (NYSE: SNAP) , which uses Google's cloud. In its S-1 filing, Snap says it built its app to use \"services provided by Google, some of which do not have an alternative in the market,\" as Re/Code's Peter Guagenti points out. Not only did Snap just agree to a $2 billion five-year contract with Google, but it's also going to be hard for it to leave Google even after the five years is up. That's excellent news for Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) investors., and not as excellent for Snap investors.\n\nUltimately, signing long-term contracts provides a moat against the growing competition. Not only does it lock in customers for the length of the contract, but it could also lock them in longer if they become dependent on certain features of a cloud platform. In that light, Amazon's fourth-quarter AWS results look quite strong.\n\nFind out why Amazon is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\n\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

It's an appealing model since it allows smaller companies to simply pay for what they need without having to invest in building the infrastructure themselves. In other words, it's an OpEx model versus a CapEx model, and Google is betting big that the market is going to shift to the OpEx model in a major way in the years ahead.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBut as companies grow, they often choose to invest in their own cloud infrastructure.

The Information reports that Google landed Snap with numerous discounts and other benefits, and Snap very much relies on Google Cloud at this point, although it also uses Amazon's AWS to a lesser degree.\n\nBack in 2014, Snap CTO Bobby Murphy said the company picked Google Cloud over AWS because the company could scale better on Google Cloud. Snap poached AWS' head of data centers in October of last year, which is a peculiar move as it may imply that Snap has longer-term ambitions to build out its own infrastructure.\n\nBut for now, Snap is firmly in bed with Google Cloud, and spends quite a bit of money. Infrastructure costs comprise the bulk of Snap's cost of revenue. From the S-1: \"Cost of revenue consists primarily of payments to third-party infrastructure partners for hosting our products. Hosting costs primarily include expenses related to bandwidth, computing, and storage costs.\" Cost of revenue in 2016 was $452 million, and Snap has committed to spending $2 billion with Google Cloud over the next five years.\n\nBut at what cost?\n\nIn discussing its operating leverage, Snap believes that using a capital-light business model will translate into \"lower costs for us in both the short and long term.\" That's definitely true in the short term, but much more debatable in the long term.\n\nHaving a larger proportion of fixed costs actually helps with operating leverage as the business grows, since those fixed costs get spread out over an increasing revenue base over time, reducing total average costs. In contrast, if a company's cost structure has a larger proportion of variable costs, those costs will scale commensurately with revenue, so you don't get as much margin expansion. It's already telling that Snap's cost of revenue exceeded revenue in 2016 ($405 million), resulting in negative gross margin.\n\nWe saw this all play out years ago in the semiconductor industry, with the rise of the \"fab-less\" and \"fab-lite\" models that are dominant today. Building a chip fab costs billions of dollars, which was a significant barrier to entry. Then contract chip manufacturers came around and allowed companies to focus more on designing the chips while the manufacturing partners would produce them. By outsourcing production to a few large chip manufacturers, the industry collectively saved billions and innovation flourished. Semiconductors mostly shifted to the OpEx model long ago, and there are only a handful of companies that currently manufacture their own chips these days.\n\nSnap is wading into uncharted territory by relying on third-party infrastructure partners at this scale. Whether or not this proves right or wrong will also depend on how Snap grows from here. One thing is for sure, though: Both aspiring start-ups and infrastructure vendors will be watching closely to see how this experiment unfolds.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Snap\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

With over 60% of the US market and more than 90% of worldwide of worldwide search, Google is ubiquitous and is not going anywhere any time soon. But even 800-pound gorillas need to look around the room every now and then and see what might be coming their way. From the looks of it, two fellow titans are pushing products that might test Google's strength.\n\nGoogle is the undisputed king of search. Image source: Google.\n\nBixby to bypass Google?\n\nSamsung acquires Viv virtual personal assistant. Image source :Viv\n\nLate last year, Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) acquired Viv, an artificial intelligence company whose founders were the original developers of Apple 's Siri . With this purchase, Samsung joined the fray of the virtual personal assistant . With several more years of development under its belt, Viv was being billed as Siri's smarter sister that would work and play well with others. In addition to the standard assistant chores fare of language search, map directions, and weather, Viv was able to respond successfully respond to extremely complex questions and follow-ups, a skill lacking in other assistants. With Samsung's acquisition, Viv was updated and reemerged as Bixby, a virtual assistant which will make its debut in the soon-to-be-released Galaxy S8. Samsung has plans to integrate its recently acquired assistant into the majority of the native apps on its upcoming phone.One of the more interesting features is the camera featuring an optical character recognition system. By pointing the camera at an object, and engaging the \"Bixby\" button, it seeks to identify said item and launches a native search engine that circumvents Google search and locates the item for purchase.\n\nThere are persistent rumors that Google has tried to prevent Samsung from making Bixby the default on its phone, and it may find legal standing to do so. Samsung phones use Google's Android operating system and the pair have a non-compete as part of their patent-sharing agreement.\n\nGoogle may not want Bixby to bypass its search, though it would not be the first such occurrence. Those familiar with Amazon.com 's(NASDAQ: AMZN) failed Fire phone will recall a similar feature -- Firefly -- that allowed users to take a picture of an object and launch the item listing on Amazon's website. Amazon's phone never gained any traction, so the fact that it bypassed Google's search never resulted in any significant threat to Google's search. The Galaxy S8 is unlikely to meet that same fate, even in light of the the Galaxy Note 7's recent difficulties .\n\nConsumers begin product searches on Amazon.com\n\nMore products searches start on Amazon than Google. Image source: Amazon.com\n\nSpeaking of Amazon, a study in June 2016 by PowerReviews found that 38% of US consumers initiated a product search on Amazon versus 35% on Google.This may be only the beginning. A larger study in September 2016 by BloomReach found that 55% of consumers begin their search for a product on Amazon versus 28% on search engines. The same report issued a year earlier reported 44% and 34% respectively. Amazon revealed that it is seeking to leverage this and its massive library of product reviews by expanding paid search, which will include not only products it sells, but items not available on the site. This product and paid search will extend to its virtual personal assistant Alexa and its Echo home systems. Few details have been released by Amazon, but this will likely compete directly for Google's advertising dollars. There is not yet any indication of a wider entry into search, but with some estimates placing Amazon's Prime membership at nearly half of US households, that might provide a natural entry into the field.\n\nThose little things can add up\n\nGoogle is already dealing with lower costs-per-click as a result of the migration from desktop search to mobile, with rates falling 15% year over year in its most recent quarter. The company was able to still grow the top line 22% in the most recent quarter by making it up with volume, with aggregate paid clicks up 36% year over year.\n\nAlphabet earns nearly 88% of all its revenue from Google's search, and small challenges like these to its dominant position could become legitimate threats to the company's cash cow over time.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares)\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .", "One of the most interesting aspects of Snap 's(NYSE: SNAP) IPO filing is that the shares it's offering to the public will have no voting rights at all. As a result, co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bob Murphy will continue to control a combined 88.6% of the company -- 44.3% each. \"Although other U.S.-based companies have publicly traded classes of non-voting stock, to our knowledge, no other company has completed an initial public offering of non-voting stock on a U.S. stock exchange,\" management wrote in its S-1 filing.\n\nIndeed, other companies have restructured their stock classes so that a founder-CEO can remain in control. Snap is just being more blunt about who's really running the show here.\n\nImage source: Snap.\n\nMost recently, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) announced plans for a stock split so Mark Zuckerberg could maintain control of the company as he gives away most of his wealth to nonprofits and other causes. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) also restructured its shares in 2014 to keep its founders in control. Snap is setting things straight from the get-go.\n\nA simple look at Snap's voting rights\n\nSnap has three classes of stock, and the voting rights are laid out like so:\n\nClass Votes Per Share Class A 0 Class B 1 Class C 10\n\nSource: Snap S1 filing.\n\nIndividual investors will only be able to buy Class A shares at Snap's IPO. The share classes do convert. One share of Class C is convertible into one share of Class B. One share of class B is convertible into one share of Class A. (No, you can't convert shares the other way around.) As such, all shares of Snap stock, regardless of class, will participate equally in the profit of the company.\n\nHow much is a vote worth?\n\nAlphabet has the same voting structure for its stock, with the caveat that A shares have one vote, B shares have 10, and C shares have no vote. Facebook announced it would split its shares the same way at some point in the future.\n\nShares of Alphabet provide the best look at how much investors value voting rights. Class A shares, which provide one vote, trade for a slight premium to the non-voting Class C shares. That premium is currently about 2.5%.\n\nAlphabet A shares vs C shares. Source: Ycharts.\n\nSo voting rights do represent some value to shareholders, or at least potential shareholders. Activist investors could buy up a significant portion of voting rights such that they can at least have some sway at shareholder meetings. With Snap's IPO, those shares won't be available to buy.\n\nWhere things get messy\n\nFollowing the IPO, Evan Spiegel will receive an additional 3% of all shares outstanding paid out quarterly over the next three years as a bonus. Those will be Class C shares, and Spiegel will then be able to exercise complete control over the company. In the meantime, there's potential for deadlock votes between Spiegel and co-founder Bob Murphy, as they each control equal-sized stakes.\n\nBut that's not the most concerning thing about the capital structure at Snap. The only way for the founders to lose control of the company is if they both die. As described in the S-1 filing, \"Either of our co-founders' shares of Class C common stock will automatically convert into Class B common stock, on a one-to-one basis, nine months following his death.\" If that happens, the other co-founder will have a controlling share of the votes.\n\nIn other words, both founders could leave the company but still be able to exercise control over it.\n\nFacebook made provisions to its stock split to ensure that Zuckerberg would only control the company's voting rights as long as he remained CEO.\n\nThere's a provision on Alphabet's Class B shareholders that for every Class C non-voting share they sell, they must convert one Class B share into a Class A share, and presumably sell that as well. That makes it more difficult for the founders to retain complete control. In fact, their combined percentage of the shareholders' vote has fallen from 61% at the time of the stock split to about 57% today.\n\nSnap's structure makes it so that not only do individual investors have no voting rights, but the founders will continue to control the company until both of them die. That's putting a lot of trust in the founders, adding more risk to an already risky investment.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares)\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .", "After months of anticipation, Snap (NYSE: SNAP) finally made its public S-1 filing with the SEC. Form S-1 is used to register securities with the SEC and provides prospective investors the first glimpse at a company's financials and other data the company wishes to disclose. Snap's S-1 has the standard balance sheet and income and cash flow statements, but it includes a lot of juicy details, as well.\n\nImage source: Snap, Author.\n\nWe already know millennials love Snapchat, and management made sure to highlight that fact. But should investors be equally enamored with the highly anticipated IPO?\n\nKey financials\n\nMetric/Year 2015 2016 Revenue $58.7 million $404.5 million Net income ($372.9 million) ($514.6 million) Free cash flow ($325.8 million) ($677.7 million)\n\nSnap S-1 SEC filing.\n\nSnap is considered a growth company, and as such, its main focus is on improving its top line. To that end, it managed to increase revenue to $404.5 million last year from $58.7 million the year before. That growth was fueled by an increase in the total number of ads shown per user, as well as an increase in total users. Snap introduced several new ad formats on Snapchat last year and opened an application program interface (API), which made it easier for more companies to buy ads.\n\nBut that revenue growth came at a price. Snap invested heavily in new research and development to create new ad products, as well as sales teams to sell those ads. Snap also experienced a 148% increase in its cost of revenue, mostly related to hosting costs it pays to Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) for its cloud platform. (It also announced plans to spend even more with Google over the next five years.)\n\nThe result was a widening net loss. The company lost $514.6 million last year, 38% more than its $372.9 million loss in 2015.\n\nSnap also believes free cash flow is an important financial metric since its reliance on Google's servers means it doesn't incur huge capital expenses like Facebook or Twitter , which own their own servers. Snap burned through $677.7 million last year, up from $325.8 million in 2015.\n\nUser growth and engagement\n\nSnap focused on daily active users in its filing, noting that it's the most useful perspective of its business. Over the last year, daily average users (DAUs) increased 48%, to 158 million. The company noted it averaged 161 million DAUs in the month of December, but it will use a quarterly average when it reports results in the future.\n\nSource: Snap S-1.\n\nSnapchat's user growth has notably slowed over the last few quarters, and Snap expects user growth to continue slowing. Investors expecting Snapchat to reach any size resembling Facebook will be disappointed.\n\nSnapchat's users are highly engaged, however. The company notes the average user opens the app 18 times per day and spends between 25 minutes and 30 minutes per day in the app.\n\nOver 2.5 billion Snaps are created every day. That compares with Facebook, which says its users spend 50 minutes per day between Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. Twitter users spend considerably less time in its app -- Comscore estimated just one minute per user last year.\n\nThat strong engagement implies that Snap has room to improve its average revenue per user. Last quarter, Snapchat's ARPU was just $1.05, $2.15 in North America. By comparison, Facebook generated $4.83 per monthly user globally and $19.81 per user in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nEven Twitter managed to produce $2.33 per global monthly user in the fourth quarter last year. Considering Snapchat ads are generally considered high value, there's a lot of room for improvement in monetization of the existing user base.\n\nShould you buy it?\n\nSnap represents a very risky investment. It's going up against stiff competition from Facebook, which is unabashedly copying its main stories feature in Instagram. Its user growth is slowing as a result. Users are also heavily concentrated in a few areas, which Snap spins as a positive by saying it has a large presence in some of the largest advertising markets. For most advertising companies, however, breadth is the name of the game.\n\nSnap's also heavily dependent on Google Cloud for its infrastructure, which will continue to cut into its gross income. Management even lists potential disruption of Google Cloud as a risk factor in the S-1 filing.\n\nStill, its revenue growth is exciting. The $405 million it generated last year surpassed its internal expectations according to a leaked document early last year. Analysts expect revenue to reach nearly $1 billion this year, and its execution last year is an encouraging sign that it can reach those expectations. Snapchat's ad products are extremely compelling and unique (although Facebook is doing its best to copy it), and it has the young audience brand that advertisers covet.\n\nUltimately, an investment in Snap at its IPO is an investment in Evan Spiegel, the visionary CEO that's led numerous product innovations at Snapchat. The S-1 filing also reveals that he's done extremely well in acquiring technology and talent to support Snapchat's growth.\n\nFor investors willing to take on significant risk and who believe in the vision and abilities of Evan Spiegel as a CEO, Snap could make an interesting investment.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Snapchat\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Cruise now has more than 20 vehicles licensed in California, up from just two in early 2016, when it was using a couple of Nissan Leafs.\n\nThis is a bright sign for the Mary Barra-led company, as it looks to own the entire ecosystem of the next version of the automobile, instead of ceding the race to others.\n\nIt's likely to keep dealing further into in this area, whether it's partnering with Lyft or adding engineers to its self-driving car fleet in order to keep testing and building cars in Detroit.\n\nProjects like this are likely to help shareholders in the long-run, even if it impacts spending in the interim.\n\nIn the fourth-quarter, GM earned $1.28 a share on $43.91 billion, ahead of estimates $1.17 a share on $41.53 billion in sales. Despite the earnings beat, investors sent shares lower on concerns of a slowdown in auto sales for 2017, as well as the potential for elevated inventory levels.\n\nIt's unclear what impact, if any, self-driving cars are likely to have to vehicle volumes in the future. There may be a need for less cars, since they could be working more efficiently. Or there may be a need for a massive resurgence in sales, as costs come down and regulators incentivize manufacturers to make transportation safer.\n\nIt's just a huge unknown at this point.\n\nGM has been building and manufacturing cars for over 100 years, giving it a leg up, at least in terms of the manufacturing process, over any of its Silicon Valley competitors. This is something that Barra has consistently cited as an advantage.\n\n“We have 100 years of really understanding vehicles, putting them on the road, making sure we have a safe, high-quality vehicle,” Barra told reporters at a December press conference. “When you take autonomous, electrification, connectivity, I think we are going to have a very special offering to the consumer.”\n\nThe world is still a ways away from Level 5 autonomy (true autonomy, in which a car can drive by itself in any condition anywhere without any help from a human), so the self-driving car race is far from over.\n\nBut it looks like GM, which has notoriously been secretive about its operations, is a lot further along than anyone thought. And that's something shareholders can rest easy about.", "In digital advertising there are Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Google, and then there's everyone else. But one company is starting to emerge as a potential contender to the two ad behemoths: Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is starting to spread its wings as an advertiser.\n\nAmazon certainly has the user data to compete with Facebook or the big Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary. Although it has only 300 million active customers as of its last update, the shopping data it has on those users is invaluable. In fact, Amazon may be able to target advertisements better than Facebook or Google despite their huge troves of user data. After all, nothing speaks louder than how people spend their money.\n\nImage source: Amazon.com.\n\nWhat's this other revenue line item, and why's it growing so quickly?\n\nDuring Amazon's fourth-quarter earnings call, UBS analyst Eric Sheridan asked about the \"other\" line item on Amazon's income statement. He pointed out that it's exhibited a lot of momentum over the past few years and wondered if that was due to growth in advertising.\n\nThe other category includes \"certain advertising services and our co-branded credit card agreements,\" according to Amazon's quarterly report. While Amazon did just revamp its credit card offering, it's been around in some form in the U.S. since 2002 and in Canada since 2012. The vast majority of growth in the category is probably coming from advertising.\n\nAnd it's been growing. Last year, other revenue in North America increased 60%. That accelerated to 81% growth in the fourth quarter. That makes it Amazon's fastest growing source of revenue, growing even faster than its cloud-computing service, Amazon Web Services.\n\nGranted, the other revenue Amazon brings in accounted for just 1.7% of its total North American sales -- $1.3 billion. So it's still working on a very small revenue base.\n\nExpanding its ad products\n\nMost of the ads Amazon sells are on its own websites. Search results on Amazon have an increasing number of sponsored products, with which third-party merchants pay to show up at the top of the page, not unlike Google's search advertising. Management described sponsored products as \"off to a great start,\" indicating they see a lot of room for expansion.\n\nA report from BloomReach last fall found that 55% of online shoppers begin their product search on Amazon.com. As more and more people search Amazon for products, the more ads it can show. In fact, sponsored products could start stealing ad budgets away from Google, which is why Eric Schmidt said it's Google's biggest competitor in 2014.\n\nBut Amazon's advertising is starting to extend beyond its own websites, wading deep into Google's territory. Last year it developed a header-bidding solution. Header bidding allows publishers to take more offers for their ad inventory instead of wading through each offer one by one and taking the first decent one they find. (This is all done extremely quickly by computer algorithms.)\n\nAmazon's advantage in the space is that it can perform the complex algorithmic ad bidding process in its AWS servers, enabling publishers' websites to load faster than other header-bidding systems allow. Google has historically dominated the space that header bidding threatens.\n\nAs mentioned, Amazon is one of the few companies with user data that can compete with the targeting capabilities of Facebook or Google. So if it continues to build out its advertising products on third-party websites, it could start to take a significant share of revenue from Google and Facebook. Google generated $15.6 billion in revenue from its network members' websites last year. Facebook's Audience Network reached a $1 billion run rate in the fourth quarter last year, but the company hasn't provided any updates since then.\n\nThe digital ad market is huge. Advertisers spent $195 billion worldwide on online ads last year, according to eMarketer. That number is expected to grow to $335 billion by 2020. If Amazon can grab just a slice of the market producing high-margin revenue, it could provide a significant boost to its bottom line.\n\nFind out why Amazon is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\n\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Facebook's latest video announcements have it playing hardball against Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) in the race to dominate the next generation of video. The company is rapidly approaching 2 billion users in a world with 7 billion people.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFacebook stock's fourth-quarter results were nothing short of awe-inspiring, as InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli reported , net income rose 128% year-over-year, compared with 2015, as revenue rose 53%.\n\nThe revenue run rate is still one-third that of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ), but the companies are competing ever-more fiercely for the same internet advertisers and, increasingly, FB is winning.\n\nSo why is Facebook stock sitting below its 2017 high? Why did it rise only 2% on those incredible earnings? Why does FB stock seem stuck in first gear?\n\nCall it the perils of leadership.\n\nFacebook Stock and Political Opposition\n\nFacebook has become a mirror on the human condition, and civilization's ills have come calling on it.\n\nGangs are now waging their turf wars on the service. Its human decision-making is opaque, and people are being destroyed by that without recourse .\n\nWorse, despite FB's insistence that it's not a media company, and that it is not political in any way, people are treating it as both.\n\nMany conservatives tied to the Trump Administration now count Facebook as an enemy and suspect all those who work alongside it. This is happening even while FB goes to unprecedented lengths to fight terrorist propaganda, working alongside law enforcement and security agencies .\n\nThe truth or falsehood of the political charges should be irrelevant to an investor. What matters is that Facebook is seen to be a media company, and seen to be a political actor, that it's being treated as such, and that responding to all this is expected to cost money, reducing margins and net income.\n\nFortunately, FB stock has a way to fight back.\n\nFB Stock: A Turing Test\n\nFacebook stock is in a race against billions of people who want its network to pass a Turing Test. Its network must pretend to be human, and to act humanely, without using people to do it.\n\nHere are just some examples of what I'm talking about.\n\nFB must act against fake news , phishing profiles created by criminals , charges of political favoritism, plus millions of individual complaints about the actions of third parties, large and small , in an automated fashion.\n\nThis is because software scales in ways people cannot. If Facebook must go to court constantly in order to protect itself, it can't continue to grow. It must automate its own self-policing, as with a recent patent application aimed at fighting a photo-tag spambot.\n\nAt the same time, FB stock must fight charges that its software is becoming bloated, dense and difficult to use. It must accept the increased complexity of video rights management in this regard. It also must accept the fact that mistakes will be made by software acting in human ways, just as people make mistakes.\n\nFortunately, all I'm describing is a need for more artificial intelligence, and that happens to be the area in software where Facebook is putting a lot of its money right now.\n\nThe company's recent delivery of a system for identifying the content of photos, and allowing them to be searched as text is searched , is just the tip of the iceberg for what's ahead for Facebook stock.\n\nBy fighting for its own survival with artificial intelligence, FB stock is pointing the way to a future defined by artificial intelligence . This is less about creating an \"artificial assistant,\" like Amazon's Alexa or Google Home, both advertised during last week's Super Bowl, and more about creating intelligence within the network so questions are answered before they are asked.\n\nIf Facebook stock can succeed here, it can overcome both its own problems and a lot of yours, to mutual profit.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

In addition most top tech brands are global, with offices all over the world, and talent working domestically that was not born in the U.S.\n\nAt least partly because of that nearly 100 technology companies including Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Facebook , Twitter , and many others have filed a legal brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit opposing President Donald Trump's temporary immigration ban keeping people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. In the brief the companies argue that the ban \"inflicts significant harm on American business.\"\n\nTrump signed an executive order banning immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat are they opposing?\n\nIn one of his first acts as president, Trump signed an executive order banning refugees and visa-holders from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. That order has been stayed by a U.S. District judge and an appeals court declined to immediately reinstate the presidential order. The technology companies, many of which operate and employ workers in and from the impacted countries filed their brief to show their opposition to the president's actions.\n\n\"Immigrants make many of the Nation's greatest discoveries, and create some of the country's most innovative and iconic companies,\" the brief states. \"America has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm. But it has done so while maintaining our fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrants -- through increased background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter our country.\"\n\nThe companies that signed the brief acknowledged what Trump was, at least on the surface, trying to accomplish with the executive order.\n\n\"We share your goal of ensuring that our immigration system meets today's security needs and keeps our country safe,\" said a draft of that letter obtained by Bloomberg News . \"We are concerned, however, that your recent Executive Order will affect many visa holders who work hard here in the United States and contribute to our country's success.\"\n\nTech requires global talent\n\nPutting aside any political questions, the tech industry opposes Trump's immigration ban in part because it takes global talent to compete. The U.S. simply does not produce enough workers -- specifically coders who write the software that powers the products made by these companies -- to meet demand.\n\nTo fill those needs companies across the U.S. use H1B visas to receive special dispensation to hire workers who otherwise would not be able to legally work in the country. A H1B visa, according to MyVisaJobs.com , allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign professionals in specialty occupations for three years, extendable to six years. \"To qualify for H1B Visa, the foreign professional must hold a bachelor's or higher degree from an accredited college or university in the specialty occupation,\" according to the site. In some cases specialized training can be substituted for a degree.\n\nTechnology companies dominate the list of employers using workers on H1B visas. Data compiled by MyVisaJobs.com shows that in 2016 Infosys held the top spot, having sponsored 25,405 visas. while Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet were all in the top 25.\n\nIt's about more than self interest\n\nIt's easy to see the business reasons behind why these technology companies oppose Trump's immigration restrictions. Most, if not all of the companies that filed the brief would be impacted by having employees unable to travel and in some cases the executive order would impact hiring.\n\nFor at least some of these companies, however, the opposition goes beyond pure business logic. Many of these brands were either founded by immigrants or by the children of immigrants and immediate business concerns aside, they simply want a world where new immigrants to the U.S. can be free to move here and found the next Microsoft, Apple, or Alphabet.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .", "Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is reportedly developing a dedicated video app for set top boxes to expand its social networking ecosystem into living rooms, according to the Wall Street Journal . The app will be different from its existing app for set top boxes, which is basically just a widescreen version of its mobile app.\n\nImage source: Facebook.\n\nInstead, the new app will mainly deliver videos from Facebook, potentially turning it into a streaming rival to Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . This supports previous reports that Facebook was looking to license original content, and suggests that its users could deliver live broadcasts to TVs via Facebook Live.\n\nWill this move pay off? Or are Netflix, Amazon, and Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube already too far ahead in the video streaming wars?\n\nUnderstanding Facebook's video efforts\n\nYouTube is the biggest video streaming site in the world, but Facebook's video ecosystem has been growing quickly. Last January, Facebook revealed that its users watched 100 million hours of videos per day. At the time, Business Insider estimated that YouTube users were watching about 650 million hours of video every day.\n\nDuring last quarter's conference call, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called video \"a megatrend on the same order as mobile\", and highlighted the ways that video ecosystem was expanding. It recently added a new tab in the Facebook app for top videos and recommendations in the U.S., tested a version of Live 360 videos for slower connections, and added live face masks and camera effects. It also plans to invest more in original video content to \"seed that ecosystem\" throughout 2017.\n\nFacebook's interest in videos makes sense, since video ads cost much more than traditional display ads. As Facebook's active user growth slows down, video ads can bolster its top line by milking more ad revenue from existing users. Since nearly 94% of Facebook's 1.86 billion monthly active users already access the site from mobile devices, it also needs to look toward other platforms -- like set top boxes -- to continue growing its ad ecosystem.\n\nCarving out a niche between Netflix and Amazon\n\nAt first glance, it seems like Facebook could collide with Netflix and Amazon's streaming video ecosystems. But Facebook doesn't plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on big budget shows like House of Cards and Man in the High Castle .\n\nInstead, Zuckerberg plans to focus on \"shorter-form content to start,\" noting that the videos will generally be split into content people produce socially for friends, promotional content from businesses and celebrities, and a class of Facebook-financed \"premium\" content to differentiate it from other platforms. CFO David Wehner was vague about what that premium content would actually be, merely stating that the company was \"looking at a wide range of content\" and \"working toward a revenue share model with creators.\"\n\nThose statements indicate that Facebook wants to carve out a niche on set top boxes, instead of trading costly blows with Netflix and Amazon. Since Facebook's video platform is all about delivering ads, the platform should also be free -- so it won't be competing for Netflix or Amazon's subscription-based revenues.\n\nIs Facebook actually making a play for smart homes?\n\nFacebook's new set top box app could also help it gain a foothold in smart home ecosystems. Amazon has already established a major presence in homes with its Kindle tablets, Fire TV set top boxes, and Echo speakers. Google is trying to catch up with Home, and Apple tethers devices to its HomeKit platform for iOS.\n\nFacebook doesn't have an official horse in that race yet, but Zuckerberg recently showcased Jarvis, a smart home AI platform he developed for his own home. The platform, which uses voice commands to control devices, is controlled via a Messenger bot.\n\nImage source: Facebook.\n\nBy expanding Facebook's ecosystem to set top boxes like Apple TV, Fire TV, and Roku, the social network could potentially piggyback off that hardware to sync with smart home devices. If Facebook links Messenger to those \"hubs\", it could take control of users' homes, gather even more data from those users, and widen its moat against Amazon, Google, Apple, and other challengers.\n\nThe key takeaway\n\nFacebook's plans to expand its video ecosystem aren't surprising, and a dedicated video app for set top boxes would be the logical next step. It won't challenge heavyweights like Netflix and Amazon, but it could capture a niche market of users who want to view Facebook video content on a streaming platform optimized for TVs. If the effort is successful, it could make its video ads more valuable and give it a firm foundation for eventually challenging other smart home players.\n\nFind out why Facebook is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\n\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

In a somewhat shocking finding, the consulting group declared that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) had lost its supremacy to Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google.\n\nAlphabet is a phenomenal company with a long track record of innovation, and the Google brand is extremely powerful. Nevertheless, it still isn't in the same league as Apple's brand in terms of total value.\n\nIs Apple turning sour?\n\nWhile Brand Finance still rates Apple as the second most valuable brand in the world, it appears to have a fairly negative view of the iPhone maker. According to the recent report:\n\nHowever, Apple's evangelists are beginning to lose their faith. The snaking queues of early adopters have shrunk almost to the point of invisibility. Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected. Put simply, Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its customers, it has failed to generate significant revenues from newer products such as the Apple Watch and cannot demonstrate that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are in the pipeline. Its brand has lost its luster and must now compete on an increasingly level playing field not just with traditional rival Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) , but a slew of Chinese brands such as Huawei and OnePlus in the smartphone market, Apple's key source of profitability.\n\nAs a result of this assessment, Brand Finance reduced its estimate of the Apple brand's value by 27% year over year, to $107.1 billion. Meanwhile, it estimated Google's brand value at $109.5 billion, up 24% from $88.2 billion a year ago. Brand Finance cited Google's dominance in search, among other things, to justify the big increase in its brand value.\n\nConsumers are paying more and more for iPhones\n\nBrand Finance's declining opinion of the Apple brand is contradicted by consumers' willingness to pay more and more for iPhones. Last quarter, Apple reported record quarterly iPhone sales of 78.3 million units. Even more impressively, the average selling price (ASP) reached a new record of $695.\n\nThe iPhone's ASP hit a new record last quarter. Image source: Apple.\n\nIn the same quarter two years ago, right after Apple released the hugely popular iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the iPhone's ASP had surged 8% year over year, to $687. Apple's ability to continue growing that ASP over the past two years, despite facing stiff foreign exchange headwinds in both years, is a testament to the massive value of its brand.\n\nIndeed, the cost of high-quality smartphones is coming down. Leaving aside Samsung, several Chinese manufacturers have become known for designing high-quality smartphones and selling them at near-breakeven prices in recent years. Apple's ability to command a huge price premium over competitors -- which extends beyond smartphones to PCs and (to a lesser extent) tablets -- indicates that its brand is as strong as ever.\n\nApple is a profit machine\n\nAccording to Brand Finance, Apple has failed to maintain a technological lead over Samsung and other rivals. In fact, many tech pundits have argued in recent years that Samsung has overtaken Apple in terms of innovation.\n\nAssuming that the two companies are on a relatively even technological footing, they should be able to produce roughly similar earnings. However, that's not even close to being true.\n\nLast quarter, Apple barely retook the lead in terms of smartphone shipments with 78.3 million, compared to 77.5 million shipments for Samsung, according to Strategy Analytics . Yet Samsung's mobile-division operating profit totaled just $2.1 billion for the quarter. By contrast, Apple's operating profit was more than 10 times higher at $23.4 billion.\n\nOn a full-year basis -- or looking just at the smartphone business -- Apple's advantage is somewhat smaller. But any way you slice it, Apple generates many times more profit than Samsung. (In its most recent fiscal year, Apple's operating profit was $60 billion, compared to about $10 billion for Samsung's mobile division.)\n\nIf Apple doesn't have superior technology relative to Samsung, its brand must be doing most of the heavy lifting to generate $50 billion of additional operating profit on an annual basis. That's more than double Alphabet's total annual operating profit of $23.7 billion.\n\nGoogle may be a powerful brand. However, it doesn't come close to the value of the Apple brand, which has turned the traditionally low-margin technology hardware business into a long-term cash cow that churns out tens of billions of dollars of profit every year.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Apple\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

We asked: How does SpaceX make money ? And we answered the question: \" How profitable is SpaceX \" when it makes all that money?\n\nMuch of this was based on educated guesswork, however, as we extrapolated what we knew about the finances at SpaceX rivals Boeing (NYSE: BA) , Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) , Orbital ATK (NYSE: OA) , and Airbus (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) , and applied it to what we thought that might mean for SpaceX's own finances. It would have been a whole lot easier to just take a good hard look at SpaceX's own financial documents, and get the answers straight from the source.\n\nLucky for us -- and for you -- The Wall Street Journal just did that.\n\nHere's your first look at SpaceX's CRS-8-mission rocket -- before it becomes the first \"reused\" orbital rocket in history. Now let's take a look at SpaceX's finances. Image source: SpaceX.\n\nIn a detailed, multi-page expose , the Journal revealed last month that it has come into possession of a treasure trove of internal financial documents from SpaceX. Combined with interviews of ex-SpaceX staff, the Journal was able to put together a pretty good picture of SpaceX's finances.\n\nIt isn't a pretty picture. Here's what we know.\n\nWall Street Journal spills the beans on SpaceX\n\nSpaceX likes to portray itself as a growing rival to space incumbents such as Boeing and Lockheed, Airbus and Orbital ATK. But in fact, SpaceX's revenue growth halted -- temporarily, we hope -- in 2014. Two failed space launches in the past two years curtailed launch activity at the space start-up, with the result that revenue actually peaked in 2014, at roughly $1 billion.\n\nSpaceX's sales then declined to just $945 million in 2015, when the company conducted only six launches. (Revenue may have grown again in 2016, or it may not have. The documents the Journal obtained apparently didn't extend into 2016.)\n\nWhat the documents do show, though -- and show quite clearly -- is that no matter how much revenue SpaceX records, it's not earning much profit from that revenue.\n\nDissecting SpaceX's finances\n\nAs revealed in the Journal 's report, SpaceX turned just a small fraction of its $1 billion in 2014 launch revenue into operating profit -- much less net profit. The numbers aren't entirely clear from the Journal 's chart, but appear to show SpaceX earning an operating profit of perhaps 0.2% on $1 billion in revenue -- profitability far below the 10%-ish profit margin that Boeing earns on its space operations, or the 12.6% operating profit margin at Lockheed Martin.\n\nThat bleak situation got even worse in 2015 when a small reduction in launch revenue sufficed to push SpaceX deeply into the red, and forced the company to record a $260 million loss on $945 million in revenue.\n\nWhat SpaceX hopes to earn\n\nSpaceX's successful return to space last month holds forth the promise that things will improve in 2017. Prior to the September SpaceXplosion, documents show that SpaceX was targeting $1.8 billion in launch revenue in 2016, and aiming to earn $55 million in profit thereon. While it probably didn't get there in 2016, there's still a chance that it could succeed in 2017 -- and achieve a 3% operating profit margin.\n\nAnd that's your answer right there: Currently, all indications suggest that SpaceX is not profitable, but losing money. Only if things go well, and SpaceX regains its footing in 2017, can we hope that the company will achieve positive operating profit margins of 3%.\n\nEven if SpaceX succeeds at this, though, it would still be earning only roughly half the 5.7% operating margin that Airbus earns at its \"Defence and Space\" business (as reported by S&P Global Market Intelligence ). SpaceX's targeted $55 million profit would also be a small fraction of the $400 million in annual profit that the Boeing and Lockheed joint venture ULA earns . On the other hand, SpaceX would eclipse the break-even profits at Airbus' dedicated space launch subsidiary, Arianespace -- and SpaceX could grow its profit margins in the future if its plans to begin reusing relanded rockets, at lower cost than using \"expendable\" rockets, pan out.\n\nSpaceX 2.0: A New Hope\n\nSo what's the upshot for SpaceX for investors who hope to one day invest in its IPO, and for investors who already, today , own a piece of SpaceX through their investment in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock? Simply put, the documents the Journal unearthed show that SpaceX is not nearly as profitable an operation as we once believed it to be..\n\nThere's also a corollary conclusion, though, that affects investors in the space industry in general. Lacking substantial profits from its launch business, SpaceX is going to have a very hard time financing a trip to Mars -- a voyage it hopes to make as early as next year -- and a voyage that could inspire a whole host of other companies to accelerate their own races to space.\n\nHow does SpaceX plan to fund its first trip to Mars in 2018 and the dozens of follow-up trips it hopes to make in the years and decades to follow? Tune back in next week for the answer.\n\n(But here's a hint: It will involve satellites .)\n\n10 stocks we like better than Boeing\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A closer look, however, reveals a very specific motivation. And it could spell trouble for NVIDIA.\n\nNVIDIA GPU is the go-to chip to train AI systems -- for now. Image source: NVIDIA.\n\nIntel has seen the market for its CPU chips shrink along with the worldwide shipment of personal computers, which fell an estimated 6% in 2016, the fifth consecutive year of declines. Competitor NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) , meanwhile, has seen the market explode for its graphic processing units (GPU), along with its stock price, which tripled in 2016.\n\nThough once used solely to render graphics in video games, NVIDIA's GPUs have become the go-to chip for training neural networks due to the massive parallel processing capability. According to a Financial Times article in December, NVIDIA \"is widely credited with having developed the best chips for training the artificial neural networks\". The use of NVIDIA GPUs by data centers -- many training AI systems -- helped revenue nearly triple in the most recent quarter, to $240 million from just $82 million in the prior year. Intel dominates the non-AI data center market, selling nearly 99% of server chips used, and it now has its sights on the nascent AI market as well.\n\nWhat is Intel doing?\n\nLate last year, Intel announced that it would release a server chip specifically designed for AI applications -- the Xeon Phi, aka Knights Mill. It indicated this processor would run 2.3 times faster than NVIDIA's GPUs when used for deep learning. NVIDIA countered, saying Intel deliberately used outdated benchmarks and older versions of its products in the comparison. It claims that had Intel used the updated benchmark, NVIDIA's offering is 30% faster, and that its latest processor is 90% faster.\n\nIntel wants to \"unleash the next wave\" in artificial intelligence. Image source: Intel.\n\nIntel's recent acquisition pushes it deeper into this market. Nervana Systems took a different approach in its AI research. It has created an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for its AI research called the Nervana Engine. Certain elements in a GPU needed for graphics processing are not necessary in an AI application. By stripping out unnecessary elements and reengineering the memory, Nervana claims it can achieve 10 times increases in the computing power currently available on GPUs. In an article from October 2015, Barron's [subscription required] explained:\n\nTheir chip has thousands of little logic engines sitting next to pools of memory, with a plethora of connections between them. They claim the chip can perform in a fraction of the time an image-recognition task that would take an Intel server chip 2,000 hours, or an Nvidia GPU, 33 hours. The key is that they are designing for specific algorithms, so the chip's design is more efficient than a general-purpose chip like Intel's or NVIDIA's.\n\nNervana Engine ASIC chips are designed to accelerate AI system training. Image source: Nervana Systems.\n\nIntel will be integrating the new technology into its existing chips in early 2017, so expect new offerings that will directly challenge NVIDIA's GPUs in the AI space. Intel also claims that by 2020, it will be able to train AI systems 100 times faster than with today's technology, though some have deemed those goals very aggressive.\n\nIt's not the only one\n\nAnd Intel isn't the only one claiming improvements beyond what GPUs currently accomplish. Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google has been conducting research in the field of AI for over five years . It announced it has a Tensor Processing Unit -- which is also an ASIC -- capable of delivering performance that is 10 times faster than any GPU running today, and that it has been running TPUs in its data centers for more than a year. They were also used in the AI system Alpha Go, which recently made headlines by defeating many top ranked Go players . This provides a degree of confirmation of Nervana's claims regarding the potential of such custom circuits.\n\nNVIDIA sees AI as a billion-dollar opportunity, though data center revenue amounted to only $240 million in its most recent quarter. Intel's revenue from data centers, meanwhile, amounted to $4.7 billion in its most recent quarter. This illustrates that while gains in the market would barely move the needle for Intel, they could be a big mover for NVIDIA. While GPUs currently hold a commanding lead in the training of AI systems, that could change quickly if the technological advances claimed by Intel came to fruition.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Intel\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The social media giant's revenues increased 51% year on year (y-o-y) to over $8.8 billion, beating Reuters' compiled consensus estimates of $8.5 billion. This was driven by a significant rise in advertising revenues, which increased 53% y-o-y to over $8.6 billion. However, this was slightly offset by a decline in Payments & Other Fees collected in the quarter, which was impacted due to a reduction in games played on the Facebook platform on PCs. In terms of the bottom line, the company's adjusted net income grew by a whopping 78% y-o-y to $1.41 per share, easily beating consensus estimates of $1.31 per share.\n\n\n\nRobust Mobile Advertising Revenue Growth\n\nAdvertising revenue, Facebook's primary source of revenue, grew 53% to over $8.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016 driven by growth in mobile ad revenues across geographies. Mobile ad revenues contributed 84% of total advertising revenues, up from 80% in the same period last year. Mobile ad revenues grew both because of an increase in frequency of ads shown in News Feed and the price per ad. The average price per ad increased 3% and total ad impressions rose 49% in Q4 2016 over the same period last year.\n\nAnother important aspect of Facebook's advertising revenue growth was its growth in average revenue per user (ARPU), especially in North America. ARPU in North America grew at an impressive 45% y-o-y to almost $20 per quarter, driving the company wide ARPU up by 29% to $4.83 per quarter.\n\nFacebook management reiterated that advertising growth is likely to come down meaningfully in 2017 because the company is going to focus on keeping ad impressions at sustainable levels. Therefore, the next wave of ad revenue growth is expected to come from price per ad and subscriber growth. Also, management stated that hiring expenses and investments in R&D, sales and marketing are expected to rise in 2017.\n\nImpressive Free Cash Flow Growth\n\nOne of the impressive aspects of Facebook's business model is its ability to consistently increase free cash flows. Despite a 83% increase in capital investments in Q4 2016 over the same period in 2015, Facebook's free cash flows increased 36% y-o-y in the quarter. This should help the company continue to make investments into newer areas such as its internet.org venture, virtual reality, augmented reality and artificial intelligence.\n\nUser Base Continues To Grow\n\nIn terms of engagement metrics, there was 51% y-o-y growth in Facebook's monthly active users (MAUs) to 1.86 billion. To put this in perspective, this means that over 25% of the world's population logs in to Facebook on a monthly basis. This ratio varies from about 64% in the U.S. and Canada to 15% in the Asia-Pacific region. Facebook's monthly active user base remained strong across all platforms, including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.\n\nAt the end of December 2016, the number of MAUs on Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger were 600 million, 1.2 billion and 1+ billion, respectively. With respect to Messenger, management stated in the earnings call that 400 million users now use the voice and video chat on Messenger every month. The company reiterated the growing importance of video in content consumption on the Facebook platform, which should also help its advertising revenue in the long term. We expect that Facebook will continue to account for a larger share of the rapidly growing digital ad market going forward, as its product offerings have become highly popular with businesses of all sizes. Facebook's long-term outlook looks strong on the back of strong monetization opportunities on its platforms across geographies as well as inroads into newer areas such as VR.\n\nPlease refer to our complete analysis for Facebook here.\n\nInteractive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):\n\nGlobal Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap | More Trefis Research", "New Purchases: RMD , PANW , CRM , UAA, CTRP, TEAM, MSA, BSRC,\n\nAdded Positions:AMZN, SPLK, GOOG, ULTI, NKE, DFE, TSCO, JLL, PCLN, SABR,\n\nReduced Positions:BIDU, AMT, AMWD, TOWN, HZN, SYT,\n\nSold Out:BSCG, CMI, UA, PRXL, TWTR , WFC, AFSI, SWGAY, GPRO, TNDM,\n\nFor the details of Motley Fool Wealth Management, LLC's stock buys and sells, go to http://www.gurufocus.com/StockBuy.php?GuruName=Motley+Fool+Wealth+Management%2C+LLC\n\nAmazon.com Inc ( AMZN ) - 51,441 shares, 4.67% of the total portfolio.

After all, there is nothing like a hefty loss to teach traders what not to do.\n\nThat is a simple fact that must be borne in mind when looking for patterns in pricing; if the pattern involves a reaction to news that was ultimately proven wrong, it is unlikely to repeat very often, and the few opportunities when it does should be grabbed with both hands.\n\nThat is what makes Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG: GOOGL) look like such a good buy after its reaction to Q4 earnings.\n\nAs you can see from the chart below, prior to last week’s earnings report Google (I’m sorry but I just can’t bring myself to call the company “Alphabet”) had dropped sharply on earnings misses contained in two of the previous three releases, in April and October.\n\nOn both of those occasions, though, the big drop in price was, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, an opportunity to buy the stock at a discount. There are different circumstances this time around, of course, but the dynamic that has made negative reactions to earnings in the past opportunities is still in place, so the end result is likely to be the same.\n\nThe biggest problems with the Q4 results as far as traders were concerned, it seems, were that cost per click was down, and operating costs had risen to the point where earnings per Class A share (EPS) of $9.36 fell short of the Street’s estimates of around $9.64. Still, revenues of $26.06 billion beat the estimated $25.26 billion.\n\nThere was also a concern lurking in the background regarding Google taking on both Amazon (AMZN)’s Echo and Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone with recent hardware launches. Google said that they were pleased with the reaction to both Google Home and the Pixel phone without going into specifics, but doubts about the wisdom of the strategy persist.\n\nI actually believe that Google has a chance of limited success in each case. The Pixel will be the most uphill struggle as the iPhone’s dominance of the mobile phone market is well established. Most estimates of sales of the phone so far are around 1 million, which hardly puts a dent in the iPhone, but may prove to be enough of a base to make the Pixel profitable as a niche product.\n\nHome has an easier, more logical path to success as Google is the natural choice of those looking for what is, essentially, a free-standing search engine.\n\nUltimately, though, neither Home nor Pixel is going to be the driver of the recovery in the stock price that history suggests will come soon.\n\nFirst, the increase in operating costs that Google reported seems, on a breakdown of the numbers, to be the result of investment in the core business. Losses in what the company calls “Other Bets,” things like “Nest” and self driving cars, were actually reduced somewhat in the fourth quarter, but there was significant progress on the autonomous vehicle front.\n\nThe possibilities of that field are endless and Google, along with Tesla (TSLA) and Apple, are generally seen as the leaders in driverless car research and technology.\n\nThe other issue, of falling cost per click (CPC), is also not what it seems on the surface. It reflects a continuing move to mobile that results in that metric falling, but the volume of clicks increasing. The same issue was, in part, responsible for the April and October drops in GOOG after earnings, and the chart tells the story of how long it was until investors realized that volume more than offset falling CPC.\n\nLooking at Google’s results and the market reaction to them, I get a sense of déjà vu. We have actually been here before, twice, and each time the drop in GOOG gave investors a chance to buy cheaply. It seems that in this case the market is still learning from its mistake and over time the outcome here is most likely to be the same.", "Digital advertising is expected to surpass television advertising in the U.S. this year -- that is, if it hasn't already. The two main beneficiaries of the growth in digital advertising are Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , which owns Google.\n\nImage source: Facebook\n\nIndeed, the two companies completely dominate the digital advertising market, combining to take about 60% of the market. Both companies are growing rapidly, especially considering their size, but which is the better buy right now?\n\nA look at valuation\n\nBoth Facebook and Alphabet trade for relatively high valuations, which would leave them off the buy list of many investors. But both companies arguably deserve their high valuations because of their rapid growth and the industry trend supporting them.\n\nCompany P/E (forward) P/S (TTM) P/FCF (TTM) PEG Facebook 24.9 15.2 43.2 0.95 Alphabet 20.0 6.8 24.8 1.06\n\nSource: Yahoo.\n\nInvestors are valuing Facebook's expected earnings and earnings growth near the same levels as Alphabet, but that puts a premium on Facebook's trailing-12-month sales and free cash flow compared to Alphabet's.\n\nFacebook does sport a significantly larger operating margin compared with Alphabet (45%, versus 26% in the third quarter), which makes its sales more valuable, but no more than twice as valuable. Likewise, Facebook's free cash flow doesn't deserve to be given nearly twice the value as Alphabet's.\n\nFor investors looking for a growth stock with a good valuation, Alphabet shares definitely take the title here.\n\nImage source: Alphabet\n\nWhat about growth?\n\nA great growth stock, however, will produce significant earnings growth for its shareholders. You'll notice the one valuation where Facebook outshines Alphabet (albeit just barely) is in its PEG ratio -- the only metric shown that accounts for growth.\n\nIndeed, analysts expect Facebook to continue growing rapidly over the next five years, with a compound annual earnings growth rate of 35.5%. Analysts expect Alphabet to produce EPS growth of just 18.6% on average through 2021. That's nearly half the rate of Facebook's growth -- and that's what you get for the premium price you'll pay for Facebook.\n\nFacebook's management recently warned that advertising revenue growth on its flagship platform will slow about midway through 2017, but it still has several other major potential revenue drivers.\n\nInstagram is still in the early days of advertising, and analysts at Credit Suisse estimate it could generate $6.4 billion in 2017 (double 2016) and $12 billion by 2021. For reference, Facebook is expected to produce $27.3 billion in sales this year.\n\nFacebook's Oculus just started selling hardware a bit over a year ago, and Mark Zuckerberg expects VR to be the next big computing platform. Not to mention Facebook has 1 billion users for both Messenger and WhatsApp left to monetize.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's growth will come mainly from the continued trend of growing digital advertising spend, which largely benefits Google. YouTube may also help drive revenue growth, but it's a much more mature advertising platform compared to Instagram and carries lower margins than Google's main ad products. While the company has several moonshots that could turn out to be huge profit machines in the future, even Alphabet's small wins are dwarfed by the size of Google.\n\nFor investors looking for a growth stock with the most potential for growth, Facebook is a better buy than Alphabet.\n\nFind out why Facebook is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\n\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Below, we provide some of the key takeaways from Apple's earnings release.\n\nWe have a $127 price estimate for Apple, which is slightly ahead of the current market price.\n\nSee Our Complete Analysis For Apple Here\n\niPhone Has A Solid Quarter Amid Shipment And ASP Growth\n\nShipments of the iPhone touched record highs, growing by 5% year-over-year to about 78.3 million units, driven by strong demand for the iPhone 7 and carrier promotions in the United States. Sales growth could have been higher (~8%) on a sell-through basis, as Apple reduced channel inventory over the quarter. iPhone ASPs came in at a record high of $695 per unit, as the demand mix for the larger 7 Plus was higher compared to previous iterations. Moreover, the increasing shift towards mechanisms such as equipment installment plans and leases, where buyers do not pay anything upfront for their devices, are also helping to skew the demand mix towards higher-tier models. Apple's total revenue guidance for Q2 FY'17 stands at $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion (4% year-over-year at the mid-point). This is relatively strong, considering that the iPhone 7 is largely viewed as a bridge device, with Apple prepping to unveil a completely overhauled 10th anniversary iPhone this fall.\n\nGreater China Sees An Improvement On Constant Currency Basis\n\nApple's gross margins came in at 38.5% for the quarter. While this was at the high end of the company's guidance range, it was roughly 150 bps lower than last year's figure. There are likely to be two key factors driving this reduction. Firstly, the strong dollar is hurting Apple's price realizations in many key emerging markets. Moreover, there is a possibility that manufacturing costs on the new iPhones are higher, on account of the more advanced components and higher memory capacity per devices. (Related: Apple's Flagship iPhone Keeps Getting More Expensive To Build ) However, this is likely to have been partially offset by a higher mix of service revenues (9.1% of total sales, up from 8% last year), which have significantly higher gross margins. Apple is projecting gross margins of between 38% and 39% for Q2 FY'17.\n\nGreater China Sees An Improvement On Constant Currency Basis\n\nApple's performance in Greater China saw some improvement, driven by a strong uptake for the iPhone 7, which emerged the best selling smartphone in the country during the holiday quarter, as well as double digit growth in iPad shipments. Revenues from the region came in at $16.23 billion, marking a 12% year-over-year decline, amid depreciation of the Chinese Yuan (down 6% year-over-year) as well as a significant decline in sales from Hong Kong. However, the company says that sales from Mainland China would have actually been up by about 6% on a constant current basis, marking a significant improvement over the firm's performance in the recent quarters.\n\nServices Growth Remains Strong, Watch Could Be Gaining Momentum\n\nServices revenues rose by roughly 18% year-over-year to an all time record of $7.17 billion, driven primarily by the App Store, which saw revenues grow by 43% over the quarter and the Apple Music streaming music service. This is positive, considering that the rate of growth in Apple's iDevice installed base is likely to be slowing down, potentially indicating that per-device spending on services is trending upwards. Apple indicated that it was looking to double its services revenues over the next four years. Apple also noted that the Apple Watch had its best quarter ever both in terms of units and revenues, with demand outstripping supply.\n\nView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):\n\nGlobal Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap\n\nMore Trefis Research", "InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFacebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) opened for trade Feb. 1 at an all-time high - a market cap of $365 billion - on the strength of its dominance in mobile apps. But the big news is that Facebook is about to challenge the video league leaders with a mobile app for existing streaming boxes like the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) TV. The question is, what will this do for FB stock?\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMoving into TV through an app rather than a device makes sense, given the failure of the original Facebook phone and its overwhelming success with apps for others' phones.\n\nFB is already bankrolling the creation of videos for the video tab of its mobile app.\n\nSo where does Facebook fit its service into the evolving market, and what does its presence as a broadcaster mean to its claims not to be a media company?\n\nFB Stock: TV vs. Phone\n\nThe company is already a presence in video thanks to Facebook Live , which allows live streaming of video on the service and it has a Presidential endorsement.\n\nFB has prepared to offer longer videos by introducing \"mid-roll\" ads - ads that play in the middle of a video - to its line-up, making the service more TV-like.\n\nOver time, this might allow Facebook to compete directly with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) YouTube in the growing market for streaming services.\n\nThe problem is that there is a big difference between the experience you get on a mobile phone and what you want on a TV screen. A phone is active, a TV is passive. A phone may support videos of a few minutes, while people will watch TV for hours-and-hours.\n\nThere is an assumption in the breathless reporting of Facebook's latest move that TV is easy; that it's just something you throw money at. Given the success of Netflix in generating subscribers and Emmys, and Amazon in generating Prime members and Oscar buzz, that is an easy mistake to make.\n\nWorth the Candle?\n\nFor Facebook stock, this may not be as huge a deal as analysts think.\n\nNetflix revenue is only a fraction of FB stock's. Analysts expect Facebook to deliver over $27 billion in 2016 revenue when it reports after the market closes Feb. 1. This is against roughly $9 billion for Netflix. NFLX also brings just 3% of that revenue to the bottom line, while FB stock brings nearly one-third of revenue to its net income line.\n\nEntering the world of creating television poses another risk. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly said he doesn't run a media company , that his is just a communications service. Media companies have responsibilities to truth and accuracy that, say, phone companies don't have - responsibilities that can limit profitability.\n\nIf Facebook is going to license content from media suppliers, whether live or scripted, it becomes a media company, subject to political and public scrutiny for its programming choices, on a global basis. This is a dance FB stock shareholders should fear, because it costs money to play, and carries risk.\n\nBut Facebook may now have no choice in the matter. The big screen is the last frontier for internet services, it's where everyone is heading. FB stock does not want to be left behind.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Facebook Stock\n\nWhile most analysts are jumping for joy over the Facebook TV app news, I am a lot more cautious. This move has enormous implications for the entire company, for how it's perceived and (more important) what it costs to run.\n\nFB, like Alphabet, prefers to manage itself through algorithms. Algorithms scale in ways people do not. Facebook is starting to bow to pressure on the media front, hiring Campbell Brown to coordinate media alliances. Now it's about to become a TV network, or at least a streaming service.\n\nWhat will that mean to its profitability and growth? I think they both slow, because people aren't algorithms and talent has temper that code does not have. Politics can kill the media star.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) announced HomeKit - its strategy for becoming the center of the smart home - in June 2014. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) revealed its Alexa-powered Echo smart speaker that November.\n\nSource: Apple/Amazon\n\nWhile there are currently several dozen HomeKit compatible smart home products, Amazon's Alexa is now connected to thousands of smart products and services and has spread from the Echo to third-party devices.\n\nOn the surface, it looks as though Amazon has outmaneuvered and thoroughly trounced Apple. But despite the seemingly insurmountable lead and momentum, AAPL could still end up beating AMZN in this smart home race.\n\nHere's how.\n\nApple Chose the Closed Approach With HomeKit\n\nApple tends to be extremely cautious. Its software is designed to be user-friendly and secure. iPhone apps can't just be downloaded from anywhere; they need to go through the official App Store and that requires approval by AAPL. Third-party hardware needs to be certified by Apple before it can be marketed as being iOS-compatible.\n\nIt's that \"walled\" approach that has made the iPhone more secure than smartphones running Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android operating system.\n\nWith the iPhone and Siri - Apple's voice assistant - at the center of Apple's smart home strategy, that focus on security, compatibility and ease of use carried over to HomeKit . Manufacturers who want to make their smart devices HomeKit-compatible face a daunting series of requirements.\n\nAs pointed out in a recent Reuters article on differing smart home approaches , this includes being forced to buy a special HomeKit chip, being limited to approved (and more expensive than average) Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips and even extends to manufacturing being limited to factories that are certified by Apple. End-to-end encryption is mandatory. Once a HomeKit product is ready, it faces extensive testing by Apple engineers to ensure compatibility. Then it may be sold. That process alone can take three to five months.\n\nSo you have additional costs, the procedural red tape and a delay. It's easy to understand why Apple currently lists only 75 or so HomeKit-compatible devices . And half of those are either different color options or regional variations of the same product.\n\nAmazon Alexa Is Open for Business\n\nAmazon took a radically different approach with its Echo speaker and Alexa. The company openly courted third-party companies to develop Alexa \"skills\" or software-enabled interactions with an Amazon Alexa-powered device.\n\nA skill can be the ability to tell Alexa to order an Uber . It could also be telling Alexa to turn on your home's smart lights or to start your electric car. The process is simple. Amazon provides an example showing how to build an Alexa skill in 60 minutes , and that includes the time needed to create a developer account. Submit the skill to AMZN for a quick verification, and it's published.\n\nThat's how Amazon Alexa tripled its available skills in just three months last year, hitting 3,000 in September. If that sounds impressive, by CES 2017 in January, it had hit more than 7,000 Alexa skills.\n\nIn addition to skills, Amazon also encourages third parties to integrate Alexa functionality into their products. That way, consumers get the Alexa experience without requiring an Echo speaker.\n\nThat's a far easier process than Apple HomeKit certification. A \"Works with Alexa\" label takes about 10 days to obtain (it can even be issued by third party labs) and doesn't require special chips. According to the Reuters post, that has resulted in over 250 products that are Alexa-certified. We saw some of these at CES, including third-party speakers with Alexa and even home appliances with built-in Alexa capability.\n\nSmart Home Security: Apple Strength, Amazon Alexa Vulnerability\n\nThe differing approaches of AMZN and AAPL have led to Alexa rapidly leaping to a massive lead over HomeKit in the smart home. However, there is one scenario where this could change rapidly.\n\nSecurity is increasingly becoming an issue for smart, connected devices. Apple's HomeKit approach emphasizes security, to the point of forcing the use of specialized chips and even certified manufacturing facilities.\n\nAmazon's Alexa strategy, on the other hand, leaves its platform relatively exposed. Amazon told Reuters it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices running Alexa. Those thousands of Alexa skills also integrate with third-party services that may have their own vulnerabilities.\n\nAll it would take is one catastrophic hacking for a PR disaster that turns consumers off Alexa. As CNET puts it in a review of the hacking risks for different smart home standards : \"Don't assume that a device has high security standards just because it works with Alexa.\"\n\nBottom Line\n\nThere's no disputing the fact that Amazon completely caught Apple and others off guard with its stealthy approach of sneaking Alexa into the home using its Echo connected speaker.\n\nBefore the Echo, it was generally assumed that a smartphone would be the natural smart home controller. Making Alexa integration so open has also paid off for AMZN, resulting in a formidable lead in the smart home in a very short time. That lead may well turn into complete domination of the connected home. But Amazon's open approach may also prove to be its Achilles heel.\n\nShould hackers turn their attention to Amazon Alexa, the resulting headlines may flip the equation and put the much more secure Apple HomeKit on top in the long run.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Will the Apple Inc.

That is especially true when those opinions are archived for all to see; it's too easy for a reader to check out that archive and find examples of when the market and hindsight combine to make even logical arguments seem foolish. I am fully aware of that, but when it comes to yesterday’s earnings release from Apple (AAPL), I will still say \"told you!\"\n\nWhat really matters about the Apple release to investors is certainly not that I got it right, nor is it even that the tech giant returned to growth in revenue for the first time in a year, nor that the already great margins at Apple increased. Those last two are important, but necessarily backward looking, as all hard data in an earnings release are by definition.\n\nWhat matters most is what the report tells us about the future and there the message was somewhat mixed.\n\nThe official guidance for Q1 2017 contained in the release fell just short of Wall Street’s expectations, which would normally be enough of a negative to more than offset the good historical results. In this case, though, a look at where Apple succeeded in Q4 2016 suggests that that guidance may just be another example of Apple’s past tendency to err on the side of under-promising and over-delivering when it comes to guidance. That is why, even though growth stalled last year, AAPL has beaten EPS expectations in three of the last four quarters.\n\nFirst and foremost, iPhone sales hit another record. That is particularly significant as not that long ago many were predicting that Google parent Alphabet (GOOG: GOOGL)’s move into the phone business would do Apple some serious harm. It looks now as if those saying that were about as accurate as those that maintained that the Windows phone from Microsoft (MSFT) or the Amazon (AMZN) Fire phone would be the next big thing.\n\nThe fact is that the iPhone has an iconic status that looks almost impossible to challenge. Even phones that are objectively better in some ways, such as memory capacity, camera resolution, or speaker quality for example, cannot take market share. As Apple advances the iPhone with each release, beating them on those and other fronts becomes harder, but remains, according to the evidence so far, a pointless exercise. As long as that dynamic remains, holding Apple stock and adding to holdings at times of weakness still makes sense for investors.\n\nThe weakness in this release was mainly in one area; iPad sales declined for the twelfth successive quarter. That, however, was offset to some extent by strong sales of Macs and Apple Watches. For the latter we are reliant on the word of Tim Cook as Apple doesn’t release a breakdown of watch sales, but, as I pointed out in the article referenced above, anybody who tried to buy a Series Two watch as a Christmas gift is probably aware that sales were at least more than Apple expected. None were available in any of the five states where I tried and most stores have just now received inventory.\n\nThat shortage of watches, combined with Cook’s admission that they seriously underestimated demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, means that the record sales reported yesterday were achieved with a background of supply constraints. Given that and the fact that there was considerable growth in areas such as services and enterprise operations that still have lots of room for Apple to expand, the message underlying yesterday’s earnings is that, despite conventional wisdom, growth can still be achieved.", "InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDisruption is everywhere. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) disrupts how we shop, while Airbnb disrupts where we stay. Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) disrupts what we drive, and Uber even disrupts whether we drive. If a teen with 2 million Instagram followers can disrupt how billion-dollar businesses find customers, the rest of us need to dive in and start swimming … or at least buy the one stock which has its hands in all of the above: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ).\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSimply put, GOOGL stock is the most innovative, most disruptive and cheapest $800 equity I know.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nSilicon Valley money manager Michael Moe and his team at GSV Asset Management produce a provocative weekly newsletter dedicated to highlighting where they think the world is going. While doing research for my Bullseye Brief , one of their recent pieces got me thinking about innovation in more tangible terms. The team ranked eight global technology companies based on their involvement across 22 cutting-edge categories. Hands down, Alphabet ranks No. 1, capturing 21 of 22.\n\nInnovation Leaders\n\nCuriously, all eight GSV-highlighted companies have dedicated efforts in the areas of artificial intelligence, big data and cloud services, making these three the Holy Grail of innovation.\n\nThe first two come as no surprise, as data gathering and analysis are critical to predicting behavior, enabling companies to target consumers accordingly. Web services, which is now the fastest-growing segment for Amazon, is less obvious but nonetheless a clear indicator these innovators want to get bigger by serving as the backbone for other companies.\n\nThis is key, and since Google already commands 49% of the global online advertising market according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, I'll bet on GOOGL.\n\nMoonshot\n\nMuch of Google's innovative efforts happen at its off-site research center called Google X, aka the Moonshot Factory. It's run by a futurist named Astro Teller, and I highly recommend his TED Talk explaining how Google X approaches innovation:\n\nIdentify a problem affecting millions of people. Find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem. Move full speed ahead if there's reason to believe technology for such a radical solution could actually be built.\n\nHe says Google X people spend most of their time \"breaking things and trying to prove they're wrong\" but believes that's their secret … what makes Googlers different. By \"killing\" more projects than they approve, their success rate rises. Alphabet spent $13.8 billion last year on research and development - the second highest number of any company in the world behind Amazon, and second highest as a percentage of sales among the eight innovation leaders.\n\nR&D as % of Revenue\n\nAlphabet invests a staggering amount of money to fund R&D, both because it can and because it has to. With three times more online advertising than its next closest competitor, GOOGL is a cash cow.\n\nBy the same token, it has significant overlap with all seven competitors in the most obvious categories - like robotics and AI- and each of these companies is hungry to dominate.\n\nThere's no letting up in this crowd. Innovate or die.\n\nWhat's GOOGL Stock Worth?\n\nUltimately, the question is value: What do we pay?\n\nI like to compare the growth we're getting (earnings) with the price we're paying (price-to-earnings, or P/E). This is called a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG), and it's an intuitive way to compare apples to apples.\n\nUsing 2017 consensus estimates tracked by Bloomberg, GOOGL stock is tucked right in the middle of the pack. Its PEG ratio is 1.08. PEGs below 1 are cheap, and PEGs approaching 2 are expensive.\n\nPEG ratios are revealing.\n\nFirst of all, no one should buy Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ). It's neither a growth stock nor a value play.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA ) is a tad expensive, but not excessively so, especially since many consider it the Chinese consumer trading vehicle.\n\nAmazon is attractive, so are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), both of which I have written up as longs and currently own.\n\nSamsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), I admit is a mystery. It's so cheap. I can only surmise its limited German and S. Korean listings deter U.S. investors, as does the $1,700 stock price. It needs to split at least 10-to-1.\n\nThe Trade\n\nSell the GOOGL April $800 puts at $20 to initiate a long-biased position.\n\nIf the stock pulls back and trades through the $800 strike price, I'm assigned shares and become a buyer. If Google continues making new highs, I pocket the premium. I am content either way. Google's chart indicates initial technical support around $780, and significant long-term support $700-$725.\n\nThe reason I'm selling puts rather than buying the stock is because GOOGL stock has recently risen to a new all-time high. I know new highs tend to beget new highs (momentum traders buy strength), but I'm a value buyer at heart.\n\nAdam Johnson is Founder and Author of Bullseye Brief , an investment newsletter that presents thematic and actionable ideas.

And why not? FB stock has been a pretty good bet.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBut could things be different this time around? Maybe the enthusiasm for Facebook stock is too carried away?\n\nWell, it is important to note that the valuation is still reasonable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio on FB stock is at about 25X. This compares to roughly 20X for both Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ). And these companies are not growing at anywhere near the pace of Facebook.\n\nWhat's more, it seems like Facebook earnings should do fine in Q4. Revenues are expected to jump by 46% to $8.5 billion and adjusted EPS are forecasted to come to $1.31, up from 79 cents during the same period a year ago. Keep in mind that - for the past five quarters - the company has beat the Street on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nFB Stock Still Faces Several Risks\n\nBut the real potential issue for Facebook stock is any disappointing commentary on the future growth trends. Interestingly enough, on the Q3 earnings call, the company's CFO had this ominous thing to say : \"We continue to expect that revenue growth rates will decline in Q4 as we lap a strong fourth quarter in 2015. We also continue to expect that our total payments and other fees revenue in Q4 will be lower than it was in the fourth quarter of last year.\"\n\nNo doubt, this should not be a surprise. As FB gets much larger, it will increasingly get more difficult to churn out strong revenue numbers. It's the curse of the so-called \"law of large numbers.\"\n\nLet's face it, Facebook already has a massive user base. In the most recent quarter, the number of monthly active users hit 1.79 billion, up 16% on a year-over-year basis. There were also a stunning 1.2 billion daily users.\n\nBut going forward, what will the sources of new users be? It's hard to tell. But initiatives from FB show concerns. After all, the company has been working hard to provide internet access to developing nations.\n\nAnd don't forget about China. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal , it appears that Facebook has made little progress. Instead, rivals like Weibo Corp(ADR) (NASDAQ: WB ) and Tencent (OTCMKTS: TCEHY ) have been capitalizing on the opportunity.\n\nAt the same time, other problems could affect FB stock. For example, during the last few months, there have been various embarrassing stories about how the company has inflated certain metrics. Might this cause some pushback from advertisers?\n\nThen there is the \"fake news\" controversy. Granted, the company has taken actions to improve the publishing of news, such as with a focus on credible sources. But this could result in lower clicks and views, which would slow down the revenue momentum for Facebook stock.\n\nSomething else that could dampen some of the enthusiasm for FB stock: the upcoming Snapchat IPO, which should hit the markets within the next couple of months. Of course, there will be tremendous buzz and excitement. There will also be the inevitable comparisons to FB. In other words, investors may look at Snapchat as an alternative to Facebook stock when seeking the next growth play.\n\nOverall, Wednesday's earnings announcement will definitely be important. And if there are signs of deceleration on the top-line, FB stock could be vulnerable, especially since it has already pulled off a nice run for the year.\n\nTom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog IPO Playbook and is a registered investment adviser representative (you can visit his site to learn more about his financial planning services).

Advanced Micro Devices forecasts revenues to range from $955 million to $1.02 billion. Using the midpoint, AMD would be looking at an 18% increase to $989 million - well above analyst expectations for $964 million.\n\nSome additional highlights from AMD's fourth quarter:\n\nThe Computing and Graphics unit saw its revenues jump by 28% to $600 million.\n\nThe cash balance increased by $6 million, for a total of $1.26 billion.\n\nThe company announced the brand of its new chips, called Ryzen. One example of the technology's power: Combined with its Vega GPU, it allows a desktop to run Star Wars: Battlefront - Rogue One at 60 frames per second in 4K.\n\nThe company announced a collaboration with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) for the Radeon GPU technology for cloud computing.\n\n(NASDAQ: , NASDAQ: ) for the Radeon GPU technology for cloud computing. AMD announced Radeon Instinct, which allows for high-end deep learning. The product is expected to hit the markets in the first half of this year.\n\nAMD Is Primed for Growth\n\nUDPATE: Management typically is conservative when it comes to earnings guidance, so we can anticipate nice traction in 2017, driven by Ryzen. For the most part, the technology looks like it has better performance and power usage compared to Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ: INTC ) 8-core, 3.2GHz Core i7-6900K that came out in May - and it's cheaper.\n\nNo surprise, then, that Alphabet has teamed up with AMD. But don't expect the large-cap tech partnerships to end there, and instead expect them to extend to the likes of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) and Salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM )? Headline-making deals like this could very well drive AMD stock in 2017.\n\nFrom CEO Lisa Su:\n\n\"As we enter 2017, we are well positioned and on-track to deliver our strongest set of high-performance computing and graphics products in more than a decade.\"\n\nSo, should bulls exercise any caution?\n\nWell, AMD stock has already staged an amazing rally, and yes, we probably won't see a repeat of 2016's triple-digit gains.\n\nAfter all, Advanced Micro Devices' market cap is now close to $10 billion. Thus, it would need to generate a hefty $450 million in net earnings to get at a 25X multiple. But Wall Street frankly might not care.\n\nAMD stock has become an excellent momentum play. Shares have become a way to play some of the hottest markets in technology, including augmented reality and artificial intelligence.\n\nAs long as growth keeps perking up, AMD still could have enough fuel to provide investors with market-beating returns.\n\nAMD Stock Charts\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge If Tuesday's after-market results hold through Wednesday morning, AMD stock should bounce off its 50-day and 20-day moving averages to roughly $11. From there, shares would see price resistance at around $11.50, then $12 - its multiyear peak.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD stock is far from gassed, with the Relative Strength Index coming in right around the center point at 50.\n\nTom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog IPO Playbook and is a registered investment adviser representative (you can visit his site to learn more about his financial planning services).

It might be just a happy coincidence that it was right after CES [the Consumer Electronics Show]. Did it feel like a tech show when you were there?\n\nJohn Rosevear: It has become really interesting. I didn't go to CES this year; we had other folks from The Fool who were out there. But CES -- the Consumer Electronics Show, which is in Vegas -- is also held usually the first week of January every year, has had more and more of an automotive focus. Ford CEO Mark Fields was out there. Mobileye and Delphi were demonstrating their new self-driving stuff out there. Fiat Chrysler showed off an electric concept minivan at CES. It's more and more focused on autos, future-tech autos.\n\nThen the press days run up until Wednesday or Thursday of that week, and then everything starts in Detroit the following Sunday. It's just a couple days later; people fly straight in. This year, it was very notable -- it was almost as if that conversation was continuing on a separate track from the traditional show itself, where they're unveiling the latest minivan and all that kind of stuff.\n\nWe had John Krafcik, who heads up Waymo. Waymo is the company under the Alphabet umbrella formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project. John Krafcik was in Detroit; he gave a presentation on Sunday afternoon talking about the state of Waymo's technology and what they're doing to test it and so forth. He was clearly there talking to the auto industry, talking to the automakers.\n\nWaymo seems to be in \"let's make a deal\" mode right now. They showed off the test car they created with Fiat Chrysler, a Waymo-ized version of the Chrysler Pacifica minivan, which is already kind of futuristic and sexy-looking. It's kind of cool-looking; their self-driving sensors and stuff are much more smoothly integrated. You can still tell it's a test car, it still has this big thing on the roof. But it looks more like something you might see produced in the near future. They were running around with Toyota and Lexus and Audi test vehicles with stuff tacked on for years.\n\nBut anyway, to get back to the point, there was a steady discussion. Ford had a whole separate thing going on adjacent to the show where they had speakers on future mobility. Ford is trying to get into the business of helping cities come up with mobility plans as electric cars, self-driving, ride-sharing, and so forth become more prevalent and more affordable as technology advances. And this is a whole separate discussion that's going on throughout the show, aside from the traditional show itself, where automakers are showing off their new vehicles to the global media. It was really interesting, the way this is going. And there were several points in the show where I wished there had been two of me, because there were two things going on at the same time that I really wanted to attend.\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

And they're not just asking the digital assistants on their smartphones; they're also buying all-new devices, such as the Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) Echo and Google Home, to answer random queries.\n\nFor Google, the subsidiary of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , the new trend in search is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides another point for users to interact with its product. On the other, Google doesn't have a stranglehold on the device market, and it isn't clear how companies can monetize voice search with ads.\n\nEven as Google navigated the shift to mobile, it still fundamentally followed the same business model -- display ads within search results. That's not possible with voice searches.\n\nBut Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't concerned. \"I see more opportunity than challenge, when I think about voice search,\" he told analysts on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. I wouldn't be so sure he doesn't have that backward.\n\nLosing the hardware battle\n\nGoogle didn't provide any exact figures on the sales of its new Google Home device. Pichai did say that \"Google Home was a very popular present that many people opened on Christmas morning,\" but that was as detailed as he got.\n\nRBC analyst Mark Mahaney suggests that Google is getting outsold 10-to-1 by competitors such as Amazon Echo. That presents a real challenge for Google, because without control over the hardware, it has no control over the user interface. That means all those potential voice searches will go to someone else.\n\nPichai points out that it's the very early days for devices such as Google Home. And Google does have one big advantage over Amazon and other competitors -- it's much better at search. \"When I look at what it would take to voice search well, our years of progress we have done in areas like natural language processing comes into play,\" Pichai said on the call. To his credit, Google Home has outperformed Alexa in many head-to-head search reviews.\n\nBut smart-speaker hardware is about more than search, and Amazon's Echo is capable of integrating with more devices and services than Google Home is. Google is certainly capable of overcoming that through more strategic partnerships, though. It just released a development kit for businesses to integrate with Google Home last month.\n\nOne area that will be harder to overcome is how well Amazon Echo works for Amazon Prime members. With tens of millions of Prime members around the world, it creates a pretty big moat for Google Home to cross.\n\nBut wait -- it gets tougher\n\nEven if Google closes the gap in hardware sales, it still has to find a way to turn voice search into a business. Hardware sales won't move the needle for Alphabet, which generated over $90 billion in revenue last year.\n\nWhat's more, Google has to sell the hardware near cost because its biggest competitor, Amazon, does the same. The margins on a Google Home device don't even come close to Google's 31% operating margin in the fourth quarter.\n\nIf Google is going to make some real money off of voice search, it needs to go beyond just getting its devices into people's homes. Google's best idea so far is to facilitate commerce through voice search . But if there's one company that has Google's number in e-commerce search, it's Amazon. Google will not win a battle against Amazon in developing a personal shopping assistant, no matter how good its search capabilities are.\n\nNot just a challenge -- a threat\n\nThe growth of voice isn't just a challenge for Google. The shift to voice represents a threat, as it could result in a decline in the amount consumers use Google search, the company's cash cow.\n\nGoogle is working to overcome the head start Amazon got in smart speakers, which accelerated the voice search trend. It plans to expand its hardware lineup and invest more in 2017. But as voice search continues growing and starts taking searches away from mobile and desktop, it will put pressure on Google to continue developing new higher-value display and search ads for its main desktop and mobile products.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares)\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

References have begun popping up in builds of the Windows 10 Creators Update (which is due to arrive in April) to Windows 10 Cloud.\n\nSource: Microsoft\n\nSpeculation is growing that Windows 10 Cloud is in fact a new simplified version of Microsoft's operating system, designed to run on devices powered by inexpensive ARM chips from ARM Holdings plc (ADR) (NASDAQ: ARMH ).\n\nIn other words, it appears that Microsoft is preparing to take on the threat of Chromebooks - the cheap, popular laptops running Google's Chrome OS. And it seems to be doing so by resurrecting the idea of Windows RT.\n\nWindows 10 Cloud\n\nWindows 10 Creators Build is the next major revision of the Microsoft Windows PC operating system. It's due to begin rolling out to users around April 17.\n\nBut developers have been testing pre-release builds of Microsoft's software and recently some of them began to notice something strange: The code references different variations of the operating system. For example, Windows 10 Pro for Workstation and Windows 10 for Enterprise are spiked out. Nothing unusual there. But then, references to Windows 10 Cloud began to appear. And that started raising eyebrows - what is Windows 10 Cloud?\n\nZDNet's Mary Jo Foley put the pieces together yesterday. Quoting unnamed sources, she says that the mysterious Windows 10 Cloud is a new, simplified version of Microsoft Windows that will run only Unified Windows Platform (UWP) apps. In other words, it's a \"simpler, safer, cheaper\" version of Windows 10 .\n\nYou might also think of it as another crack at Windows RT …\n\nWindows RT? But Why?\n\nEveryone remembers the mess that was Windows RT . The attempt to shoehorn a version of Windows onto a consumer tablet running ARM chips -the ill-fated Surface RT - very nearly dealt MSFT's tablet aspirations a fatal blow.\n\nHowever, despite the failure of Windows RT, Microsoft has never given up on the idea of Windows on ARM chips. By doing so, it can get Windows onto mobile devices that can't use the more powerful and expensive chips from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ). The company has already been showing off Windows 10 running in emulation on high-end ARM chips . As part of that effort, it could also be working on a \"lite\" version that can deliver much of the Windows 10 experience on less expensive, lower powered ARM hardware.\n\nSo why, why, why would Microsoft risk falling flat on its face again with what essentially amounts to another crack at Windows RT? There are two reasons.\n\nThe first is that dream of \"Windows everywhere.\" Having the full Windows 10 experience on high-powered ARM chips is great, but only flagship smartphones and tablets can afford to use those chips. Windows 10 Cloud would get Microsoft Windows (and Bing) onto a whole lot more mobile hardware.\n\nThe second is Google's Chrome OS and Chromebooks. These cheap laptops have been under Microsoft's skin for years. They've become extremely popular in the education sector thanks to low cost, ease of use and built-in security. And Chromebooks have just kept selling, to the point where last year they passed even Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) MacBooks in sales .\n\nMicrosoft has tried fighting back by helping manufacturers put out cheap Windows 10 laptops, but that hasn't stemmed the Chromebook flood. Windows 10 makes for a sluggish experience on inexpensive Intel hardware, it's far more complex than Chrome OS to use and lacks the drop-dead easy security of Chromebooks.\n\nWindows 10 Cloud running on laptops with ARM processors would compete head-to-head with Chromebooks running Chrome OS: simpler, safer and cheaper than Windows 10.\n\nMicrosoft refused to comment on the ZDNet post, but the pieces pointing to Windows 10 as a Chrome OS-fighting, second crack at Windows RT make sense. Naturally, MSFT is going to avoid all references to Windows RT - that's poison - and the Windows 10 Cloud name could end up being a code name.\n\nIt could also be an attempt to steal some of the Chrome OS \"cloud\" thunder. Expect to get the final answer on Windows 10 Cloud from Microsoft prior to that April 17 Windows 10 Creators Build release.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Resurrecting the Cursed Windows RT? appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) took its turn in the earnings limelight last week, and investors were not happy with the results. Offering up a rare miss , Alphabet said it earned $9.36 per share versus expectations of $9.63 per share, while revenue arrived at $26.06 billion compared to predictions for $25.22 billion.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGOOGL stock has since fallen more than 5%, and its edging lower once again today.\n\nBut the shares were due for a bit of a selloff, as GOOGL stock was overbought heading into earnings amid an overly enthusiastic sentiment backdrop. Contrarian investors know that this is a recipe for short-term disaster on even the slightest hiccup.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge Now that the knee-jerk selling has about run its course, it's time to get back to being realistic on GOOGL stock's prospects. Technically, Alphabet shares remain in a long-term uptrend, supported by its 10-week and 20-week moving averages.\n\nFurthermore, these trendlines completed a bullish cross earlier this month, which could bring bargain hunters to the table once the post-earnings gyrations have subsided.\n\nAs for sentiment, the fourth-quarter earnings blip for GOOGL stock hasn't shaken the brokerage community one bit. And it shouldn't. According to Thomson/First Call, all but two of the 48 analysts following Alphabet Inc rate the shares a \"buy\" or better. Additionally, the 12-month price target of $988.47 represents a modest premium of only about 19% to GOOGL's Monday close.\n\nWith search ad revenue holding strong and Alphabet expanding its hardware program, we may even see a few upward revisions in the next month or so.\n\nOn the options front, GOOGL Feb./March put/call open interest ratio has risen slightly in the past week to rest at 0.72, with puts gaining a bit of traction in the wake of last week's quarterly report. For the March series, traders are still eyeing the $860 and $900 strikes, while put traders are focused on $800 and $750.\n\nOverall, March implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 5% in the next two months. Currently, this places the upper bound at $865.02, while the lower bound lies at $782.64 from Monday's close. I would be surprised to see GOOGL stock trade south of $800, as it would take some unexpectedly poor news from Alphabet or a significant turn in the overall market. A rally to $860 seems more likely, though resistance at $850 could be a stumbling block.\n\n2 Trades for GOOGL Stock\n\nPut Sell: The safest route to profit on GOOGL stock right now would be to bank on technical support and sell option premium. Right now, the March $800 put looks like a solid bet for such a play. At last check, this put was bid at $12, or $1,200 per contract.\n\nAs usual, you keep the premium as long as GOOGL stock closes above $800 when these options expire. The downside is that should Alphabet trade below $800 ahead of March expiration, you could be assigned 100 shares for each sold put at a cost of $800 per share.\n\nCall Spread: If you are more bullish on GOOGL stock's prospects, then a March $830/$850 bull call spread has potential At last check, this spread was offered at $8, or $800 per pair of contracts.\n\nBreakeven lies at $838.00, while a maximum profit of $12, or $1,200 per pair of contracts, is possible if Alphabet closes at or above $850 when March options expire.\n\nAs of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Buy the Dip in Alphabet Inc (GOOGL, GOOG) Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Last December, I highlighted MeetMe (NASDAQ: MEET) as a potentially undervalued growth play in a frothy market. The social networking app maker posted eye-popping numbers last quarter -- 32% annual growth in monthly active users (MAUs), 20% growth in total revenues, and 30% non-GAAP earnings growth.\n\nAnalysts expect MeetMe's revenue and non-GAAP earnings to respectively rise 38% and 16% next year. Yet the stock trades at just 7 times trailing earnings and 10 times forward earnings. Let's take a look at the five key reasons investors aren't buying MeetMe's growth story, despite its high growth figures and low valuations.\n\nMeetMe's mobile app. Image source: Google Play.\n\n1. A troubling history with sexual predators\n\nMeetMe lets users find new people in their area to chat with, similar to Match 's(NASDAQ: MTCH) Tinder. While there's nothing inherently sinister about the app, there have been multiple reports of MeetMe being used by sexual predators.\n\nIn 2014, the City of San Francisco sued MeetMe for the unlawful publication of minors' profiles, photos, and geolocation data, and claimed that the app \"enabled\" sexual predators to find their victims. The city cited several cases involving adult men and minors in which MeetMe was used. MeetMe settled the case for $200,000 the following year, agreeing to clarify and simplify its user agreements and settings, and reducing the amount of data displayed on minors to their city and state.\n\nBut the cases involving MeetMe didn't cease -- last February, a Buffalo man was charged with multiple counts of child pornography after using MeetMe to find minors. MeetMe's troubles raised red flags at Tinder, which hiked its age limit from 13 to 18 last June. Yet MeetMe still hasn't followed suit, presumably because it would lose a large portion of its users.\n\n2. The potential loss of ad revenues\n\nYou'd think that big companies would be reluctant to advertise on MeetMe, but plenty of big brands still advertise on the app. That's because MeetMe generates most of its ad revenues from programmatic ads delivered by Twitter 's(NYSE: TWTR ) MoPub.\n\nThis means that MoPub's customers simply pick a demographic -- in MeetMe's case, younger users and Millennials -- and the platform feeds the ads to various apps. This means that many companies probably don't realize that their ads are appearing on MeetMe.\n\nTherefore, a common bear thesis is that MoPub could decide to drop MeetMe due to violations of its terms of service, or advertisers could ask MoPub to pull their ads from the controversial app. There's no evidence either of these scenarios will occur, but it raises a troubling question -- if MeetMe's reputation worsens, can it still keep growing its ad revenues?\n\n3. Being booted from the app stores\n\nIn its 10-K filing for fiscal 2015, MeetMe admits that its business will suffer if it is \"unable to maintain a good relationship\" with Apple and Alphabet 's Google. It notes that its app could be pulled from their app stores \"if we violate\" or the companies believe \"that we have violated\" their terms and conditions.\n\nThe bulls might believe that's just a typical \"risk factor\" warning, but MeetMe admits in the same filing that \"on more than one occasion,\" Apple rejected its app \"because of user generated content and other concerns.\" This indicates that another high-profile lawsuit could knock MeetMe out of the app stores and kill its business.\n\n4. Tinder is crushing MeetMe\n\nMeetMe arrived before Tinder, which was initially launched in 2012. But over the past five years, mainstream interest in MeetMe waned in correlation with Tinder's growth, as seen in this chart from Google Trends:\n\nImage source: Google.\n\nThat decline also explains why MeetMe acquired its competitor Skout last October. That move boosted the company's MAU count from about 5 million to 8.5 million, and greatly inflated MeetMe's top and bottom line growth for fiscal 2016.\n\n5. The lack of insider confidence\n\nIf MeetMe is as undervalued as the fundamentals suggest, you'd expect insiders to be loading up on shares. However, MeetMe CEO Geoffrey Cook just sold 250,000 shares (16% of his entire position) at an average price of $5.02.\n\nIncluding Cook's sales, insiders sold 1.96 million shares over the past 12 months, but only bought 334,000 shares. It's understandable that MeetMe's insiders would sell after the stock's 50% rally over the past 12 months, but it also indicates that its upside potential could be limited.\n\nThe key takeaway\n\nThe main lesson here is to always look beyond the valuations and growth forecasts. On the surface, MeetMe looks like a rapidly growing social app maker trading at a discount to its peers. But dig deeper, and you'll see an app that's struggling to prove that it's not a tool for criminals while remaining relevant against Tinder, which dominates the space with over 50 million active users.\n\n10 stocks we like better than MeetMe\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's why investment professionals typically recommend investors take a long-term approach to investing to reduce the risk of losing principal. If you invest at the wrong time, you could lose a significant amount of your money overnight, so keep in mind that stocks are not always the best short-term investments.\n\nThat said, stock prices work both ways. A prudent — or lucky — investor could make a great deal of money just as rapidly as he could lose it. If you have a tolerance for risk and are willing to do the research, short-term trading might be a solution for at least part of your portfolio.\n\nIf you decide to go this route, don't hesitate to contact a financial professional if you need assistance. Most important, if you're looking for stocks to buy now, do your homework to find good ones in which to invest. You can begin here with this list of 15 stocks to buy that might be the best short-term investments for your portfolio.\n\nApple is one of the best-known companies in America, thanks in no small part to the iPhone. It's also the largest U.S. company in terms of market capitalization — the value of a company that's traded on the stock market — a number you can calculate by multiplying a company's stock price by the number of its outstanding shares. In the case of Apple, this number topped $618 billion as of late December 2016, coming in ahead of competitors Alphabet at $548 billion, Microsoft at $494.6 billion, Amazon at $366 billion and Facebook at $343.1 billion.\n\nApple stock is positioned to move even higher in 2017. The company is aggressively buying back stock, which reduces the number of outstanding shares and increases earnings per share. Its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus, are the best-selling phones in its history. Apple also holds roughly $200 billion in overseas cash, which might move home this year if corporate taxes on repatriation are lowered. To top it all off, the stock is trading at just about 10 times earnings.\n\n2. Gilead Sciences: GILD\n\nIf you're looking for a short-term stock that had a rough go of it in 2016, Gilead Sciences might be your pick. The biotechnology company's sales of its hepatitis C drug declined and the stock fell 29 percent in 2016.\n\nGilead could turn out to be one of the best stocks for 2017, however. The company trades at the compelling valuation of 6.99 times estimated earnings over the next year. It's bought back 14 percent of its stock over the past three years, and with its $32 billion cash hoard, the company might continue to buy more or make strategic acquisitions. Gilead also uses its cash to pay out a 2.5 percent dividend to shareholders. The stock could very well hit $101 in 2017, according to analysts at JP Morgan.\n\nAlphabet, formerly known as Google, is one of the world's great businesses, according to Barron's. The company owns numerous products and services including Google Maps and Google Play, YouTube, Nest, Chrome, Android, and Gmail. Analysts project 2017 revenues for the company in excess of $103 billion, which would represent a growth rate of more than 18 percent.\n\nGiven the current political climate, Alphabet might see a short-term boost in the form of repatriated cash. The company currently holds about $80 billion in cash overseas, which translates to around $115 per share. Additionally, it has a lot of room for cost cutting because it spends freely on noncore businesses. Some analysts are estimating $41 per share in earnings this year, which would be huge since the company currently trades at just 18 times earnings.\n\nEven if you don't use Facebook at home or on your smartphone, it's hard to avoid its presence in store windows or on advertising asking you to \"like\" something. The key to Facebook's financial success is its monetization of its enormous customer base. It has 1.79 billion monthly active users — and that number continues to rise. Lately, Facebook's stock price has gone up and exceeded analyst earnings estimates by an average of 21.11 percent.\n\nFacebook is still investing in ways to grow its earnings even more, with mobile ads and video revenues currently doing the heavy lifting. The company is also expecting big things out of its virtual reality investments. With a long-term growth rate of 27.6 percent, the company is expected to continue its rise.\n\nCitigroup could benefit from a number of factors in 2017, including rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates for just the second time in a decade in 2016. The Fed indicated that it expects to hike rates an additional three times in 2017. In response, the two-year Treasury note hit its highest rate since 2009. When interest rates rise, banks can charge more money on loans and credit cards, potentially increasing their profitability.\n\nCitigroup's stock has lagged compared with its peers' so far in 2017, which gives it room to catch up. The stock trades at just about 11 times its expected earnings for next year — and it trades at the widest discount-to-book value of the major banks. This means the stock is discounted more than 25 percent compared with the price-earnings ratios of its peers, making it a possible value play.\n\nIBM is another turnaround candidate for 2017. The company used to dominate the computer hardware and services business sector but has been surpassed in recent years by its competitors. However, its slow turn toward the more modern businesses of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, mobility and security is showing signs of bearing fruit.\n\nThe company spent more than $5 billion in acquisitions in 2016 alone, and its new product lines now account for more than 40 percent of firm revenues. Its analytics division showed revenue growth of 16 percent, and its cloud business jumped by 42 percent — both hopeful signs for future growth. IBM's artificial intelligence business has generated positive buzz thanks to its Watson cognitive system, which is known for beating two human \"Jeopardy!\" contestants. The stock trades at a 12.19 price-earnings ratio based on expected 2017 earnings.\n\n7. Norwegian Cruise Line: NCLH\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line is poised to benefit from the rapidly growing cruise segment and could be one of the best stocks to buy now. With the core demographic of aging baby boomers on the rise, cruise lines are a growing market. The company doesn't pay dividends to shareholders but reinvests its cash flow into building more ships and expanding its routes. Norwegian has already won approval to sail to Cuba, and it has repositioned its calendar to deploy ships into the fast-growing Asian market for the first time in 15 years.\n\nNorwegian boasts the newest fleet among its major North American competitors, making it attractive to customers looking for the latest and greatest offerings. The company owns a diversified portfolio of maritime brands including Oceania and Regent Seven Seas. Analysts estimate the stock will grow earnings by more than 18 percent in 2017 — the stock trades at just 14 times 2017 estimates.\n\nAmazon has grown from an online bookseller to the eighth-largest retailer in the world, and it hasn't shown any signs of slowing down. Amazon will become the largest apparel seller in the U.S. by 2021, when it will be selling $62 billion in apparel annually — more than TJ Maxx and Macy's combined — according to analysts at Cowen Group.\n\nAmazon is firing on multiple fronts: It's poised to capitalize on streaming media's popularity via its Amazon Prime subscription service. Additionally, its Web Services business is more advanced than competitors Microsoft and Alphabet's cloud offerings, thanks to it being first to market. Analysts at Evercore ISI Institutional Equities cite Amazon as the best internet stock for 2017. Excitement is also brewing over Amazon's latest foray into the grocery business, Amazon Go. In true disruptor fashion, Amazon's take on the grocery store is to use sensors rather than grocery clerks.\n\n9. Restoration Hardware: RH\n\nRestoration Hardware is a well-known, luxury home furnishings brand that suffered through 2016. Its earnings fell and triggered a stock sell-off in which shares lost more than half their value. However, the company has shown some signs of being a possible candidate for short-term traders. In its most recent quarter, revenue actually rose 3 percent and beat analysts' estimates by more than $20 million. Earnings also beat Wall Street expectations by 4 cents per share.\n\nIn addition to rebounding sales and earnings, Restoration Hardware conducted an image makeover. Going forward, the company will be called simply \"RH.\" Additionally, the company has launched a new, RH Modern line. In an attempt to capitalize on a more current type of revenue stream, RH is now offering annual memberships. As a result, analysts peg the company's five-year earnings growth rate at 20.33 percent, with earnings for the upcoming year jumping 61.27 percent.\n\n10. Toll Brothers: TOL\n\nToll Brothers is a leading luxury home builder, a business that's been hit hard on many fronts. Although risks remain, the fear of rising interest rates dampening homebuying activity has sent Toll Brothers stock to a bargain price. The company now trades at less than 10 times its anticipated 2017 earnings, which are expected by some to rise 20 percent.\n\nSome concerns over the luxury condo market in New York City also hang over the stock, but company reps indicate that earnings will hold up. With the stock seemingly priced for a worst-case scenario, its valuation of about 1.2 times book value is compelling. If housing markets hold firm or interest rates don't rise dramatically, Toll Brothers stock could prove surprising to those anticipating the worst.\n\n11. Deutsche Telekom: DTEGY\n\nDeutsche Telekom is a German stock that many investors might recognize as the former parent of U.S. T-Mobile. The company still owns a 65 percent stake in the independently traded T-Mobile — and that stock has been skyrocketing. Deutsche's core European telecom business trades at a discount compared with its peers — it fell by 13 percent in 2016 — even though it's the leading wired and wireless operator in Germany. Sporting a nearly 4 percent yield, some analysts describe the stock as undervalued.\n\nA takeover play might happen in 2017: Comcast has had its eye on T-Mobile as a potential purchase. T-Mobile might also make another attempt to merge with Sprint, which could end up being a catalyst for Deutsche's stock. If everything falls into place, a share price of $20 isn't inconceivable.\n\n12. Sprouts Farmers Market: SFM\n\nSprouts Farmers Market flies under the radar of many investors because it's not really a headline-making stock. This lack of publicity might work to its advantage, however, as more investors become aware of its potential. Sprouts is drawing customers from the growing natural and organic food segment — and it prices its goods below that of its notable peer, Whole Foods Market. As a result, some analysts see the company generating mid-teens earnings and revenue growth in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company is growing out of its base in the American Southwest and moving east, growing 14 percent in square footage every year. Coupled with its favorable market segments, Sprouts is generating positive cash flow and returning cash to shareholders via a stock buyback program. At 20.5 times estimated 2017 earnings, the stock could be ready to move.\n\n13. Delta Air Lines: DAL\n\nDelta Air Lines has greatly improved its financial performance but still trades at a typical airline multiple of about nine times estimated 2017 earnings. Since 2009, Delta has worked to cut its debt in half. As a result, it now has an investment grade rating from independent ratings service Moody's. To further entice shareholders, Delta pays a 1.7 percent dividend and has aggressively repurchased stock.\n\nDelta management feels the stock should be valued more like a diversified industrial company, which would dramatically raise its multiple, and, therefore, its share price. If you need another short-term catalyst, look at the company's free cash flow. Delta is a cash-flow machine — it generated $4.1 billion in cash flow in the last 12 months alone and put just 9.8 percent of that into dividend payments, according to Forbes.\n\nAnother value play for 2017 could be Novartis, a Swiss diversified drug company and the world's biggest prescription drugmaker. The company's share price had a difficult 2016 but now trades at about 15 times next year's earnings. With a yield of about 3.75 percent, Novartis has an analyst consensus price target of $87, some $15 north of its current price.\n\nPart of what held Novartis back in 2016 was fear over the slow start of Entresto, its heart-failure drug, but some analysts think sales will soon accelerate and could go as high as $3 billion. Novartis also gets 25 percent of its sales from high-growth, emerging markets, which makes it less dependent on the more mature U.S. drug market. The company's recent purchase of Encore Vision should also shore up its vision sales and further enable it to diversify its holdings.\n\n15. General Motors: GM\n\nGeneral Motors has been an integral part of the global auto industry for more than 100 years and has recently faced headwinds. Some market participants feel that global auto sales have peaked, and concerns over the movement to electric vehicles have held back GM stock. Whatever the reasons are, General Motors currently trades at a low price-to-earnings ratio of 4.3. Even industry competitors — like Ford, which trades at a ratio of 6.6, and Toyota, which trades at 9.7 times — trade at higher multiples, and GM's average price-earnings ratio over the past five years is 12.2.\n\nGM could move higher as the market appreciates its emerging electric and hybrid portfolio. Some analysts feel GM has the bankroll and technology to undersell rivals such as Tesla and perhaps even compete on quality at some point. GM stock began rallying at the end of 2016, which leads some analysts to predict it could double in price over the next one or two years.\n\nData is accurate as of Jan. 25, 2017.

But there's one other item in the company's most recent quarterly report investors may want to take the time to consider: A key change in the way Alphabet will be calculating its non-GAAP results.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nStock-based compensation to get the weight it deserves\n\nIn a surprising move, Alphabet explained in its fourth-quarter earnings call that it will no longer exclude stock-based compensation from its non-GAAP results. The change will weigh on non-GAAP earnings per share, but Alphabet believes it will give investors a better view of the company's regular operations.\n\nAlphabet CFO Ruth Porat explained the change in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\n[Stock-based compensation] (SBC) has always been an important part of how we reward our employees in a way that aligns their interests with those of all shareholders. Although it's not a cash expense, we consider it to be a real cost of running our business because SBC is critical to our ability to attract and retain the best talent in the world. Starting with our first quarter results for 2017, we will no longer regularly exclude stock­-based compensation expense from non­-GAAP results. Non­-cash stock­-based compensation will continue to be reported on our cash flow statement, but we will no longer be providing a reconciliation from GAAP to non­-GAAP measures that reflects SBC and related tax benefits.\n\nThe change sheds light on the growing cost of Silicon Valley-based talent for tech companies in the Bay Area. Stock-based compensation at companies such as Alphabet and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) have grown consistently in recent years, so much so that the two companies have recently announced share repurchase programs seeming to simply aim at offsetting the dilutive impacts of expected stock-based compensation.\n\nTo see what this growing stock-based compensation looks like, consider Alphabet and Facebook's stock-based compensation in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.\n\nCompany Q3 2016 Q3 2015 YOY Change Alphabet $1.86 billion $1.4 billion 33% Facebook $2.91 billion $2.86 billion 5%\n\nA precedent for other tech companies\n\nAs one of the biggest tech companies in the world, Alphabet, with the change to its non-GAAP reporting, highlights how regular stock-based compensation has become in Silicon Valley, and it sets a new precedent for other companies to make a similar change.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nFacebook could very well be one of the next big tech giants to make a similar move. And if it's not planning on making the same change soon, it should. The social network appears to be on the same page as Alphabet when it comes to expecting significant stock-based compensation in the years ahead. Facebook CFO David Wehner said in the company's third-quarter conference call that he \"anticipates 2017 will be an aggressive investment year.\"\n\nWehner explained: \"Adding top engineering talent remains one of our key investment priorities as we continue to execute on our three-, five- and 10-year roadmap. We will continue to invest in our ability to recruit top technology talent both in the Bay Area and beyond.\"\n\nAlmost certainly not a coincidence, Facebook announced a $6 billion repurchase program -- an authorization about equal to what the company will probably spend on share-based compensation in 2017 -- shortly after it said Bay Area hiring would drive an aggressive investment year for the company.\n\nThe bottom line?

The move was part of an effort to become profitable in 2017. Twitter lost $103 million in the third quarter and $290 million through the first nine months of the year.\n\nBut Twitter's workforce isn't the only thing slimming down. Twitter is also laying off some of its underperforming products. The most recent is Fabric, Twitter's software development kit for mobile apps. Google -- the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary -- is buying the business for an undisclosed amount. Twitter also shuttered Vine earlier this month as it focuses more on its core platform to generate a profit.\n\nTwitter is having a fire sale\n\nRumors swirled for weeks last autumn ahead of Twitter's third-quarter earnings that Twitter was trying to sell itself. After failing to find a buyer, Twitter is faced with the reality that it needs to show it can become profitable in order to either attract better takeout offers or attract more interest on Wall Street.\n\nIt tried to sell off Vine, the six-second video app it bought and brought to market. Nobody bought it, so it had to shutter it. Google's interest in Fabric was fortuitous, considering Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) never found a buyer for its software development kit, Parse, and shuttered it last year.\n\nNeither Fabric nor Vine ever generated revenue for Twitter. Both were designed to support the Twitter ecosystem, improving the functionality and engagement on the core platform. That didn't really happen, though, and Twitter's functionality and user base have remained the same for some time now.\n\nTwitter still has various businesses that generate varying amounts of revenue. By and large they remain tied to its core platform. The only major exception is Periscope, its live-streaming app. The company just bought Periscope two years ago, but with the growth of live-streaming thanks in part to Facebook, it could likely find it a new home. Still, Twitter may be better off migrating Periscope's users to Twitter's new live-streaming feature and shuttering the original app.\n\nUltimately, Twitter seems intent on selling itself off piece by piece until all that remains is the core revenue generating businesses -- advertising and data licensing.\n\nWhat is Twitter focused on for 2017?\n\nTwitter seems most intent on growing video on its platform. Most recently, it signed a deal with Dick Clark Productions to live-stream the red carpet shows from various award shows later this year.\n\nTwitter views premium event streaming as an opportunity to engage its light users. In its third-quarter letter to shareholders, Twitter noted that light users watched more Thursday Night Football than medium and heavy users. Increasing engagement among light and logged-out visitors is one of the biggest opportunities for Twitter to build engagement and acquire new users -- one it's been talking about for several years now.\n\nTwitter also launched live video within its own app last month, a feature that lets anyone start streaming live. It basically does the exact same thing as Periscope, but it's more integrated with Twitter's main platform. Twitter was originally hesitant to merge the two products, but the success of Facebook Live may have swayed the product or management team.\n\nVideo was Twitter's top revenue-generating ad format in both the second and third quarters last year. Investors should expect continued efforts around delivering more organic video in a bid to attract more premium mobile video ad budgets. Twitter sees video ads as a much larger market than the generic social media advertising market.\n\nAn imperfect plan, but it just might work...kind of\n\nTwitter appears hell-bent on meeting its goal of reaching profitability in 2017. It's reducing its workforce, cutting out overhead from products like Fabric and Vine, and investing all it can in premium video-streaming deals. After more than a year without significant user growth and slowing revenue growth, Twitter is officially exiting growth mode and focusing on the bottom line.\n\nTwitter may very well turn a profit in 2017, but it's guaranteed to be a much smaller profit than investors initially expected when the stock went public three years ago. (Of course, that's reflected in the stock price.) Additionally, its ability to grow profits without a growing user base or product pipeline is questionable.\n\nWhile management isn't wrong to start focusing on profitability, it seems to be thinking more short-term than long-term in order to reach a self-imposed goal. A goal, I might add, that seems more focused on finding a buyer than building real value for shareholders.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Twitter\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .", "\"2016 was simply a great year for us,\" said Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) CFO during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. And it would be tough to argue with him. In 2016, Google parent Alphabet's revenue and profits increased, its core advertising business, non-advertising initiatives gained significant traction, and it wrapped up the year with two very successful Google-branded hardware launches. Here are eight facts to help capture Alphabet's business in 2016.\n\nGoogle offices. Image source: Alphabet.\n\nTotal revenue increased 20% -- a notable acceleration from 14% year-over-year growth in 2015. And growth even picked up throughout 2016, with the company reporting 22% year-over-year growth in its fourth quarter, or 24% on a constant currency basis.\n\nGOOGL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts .\n\nAlphabet cited mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising as key revenue drivers during the year.\n\nOther bets revenue soared 82%, driven primarily by its smart home Nest products, Google Fiber internet, and Google's life science organization, Verily.\n\nStill, other bets remain unprofitable. Indeed, the segment, which only represents about 1% of Alphabet's total revenue, lost $2.9 billion in 2016 when excluding stock-based compensation -- and this loss was on just $809 million in revenue. Including stock-based compensation, other bets operating loss was a whopping $3.6 billion.\n\nAlphabet spent $3.7 billion repurchasing its own shares. As part of Alphabet's $7 billion repurchase program, the company's share repurchases in 2016 climbed higher. But investors shouldn't expect the share repurchase program to meaningfully reduce the company's shares outstanding, as Alphabet's stock-based award activities are almost just as aggressive . In 2016, Alphabet paid $3.3 billion in stock-based compensation.\n\nOther revenue increased 41%. Not to be confused with Alphabet's much smaller other bets segment, the company's other revenue, which is made up of non-advertising Google products, was driven primarily by Alphabet's Google Play app store, hardware sales, and cloud businesses.\n\nAlphabet introduced Waymo. Buried in Alphabet's other bets business, Alphabet's self-driving car technology development became a stand-alone business called Waymo .\n\n\"Waymo may be a new company, but we're building on advanced self-driving technology developed over many years at Google,\" said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik in a December blog post. Alphabet intends for Waymo to commercialize self-driving vehicle hardware and software, aiming to dramatically improve road safety.\n\nIn October, Alphabet launched a smart speaker and a smartphone. The company's voice-activated Google Home speaker and its new Google Pixel phone were clear successes this holiday season. While the company doesn't provide specific sales figures on the device, management did say it was \"thrilled with the reception\" for these devices, and that their success looks promising.\n\nGoogle Home. Image source: Google.\n\nAlphabet made significant progress in its cloud business. Management said in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call that its cloud business is on a \"terrific upswing.\" With the help of Alphabet's well-timed $625 million acquisition of API provider Apigee, Alphabet made particular progress differentiating its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by sharpening its offerings in data analytics, machine learning, security, and tools for application development. Further, in 2016, Alphabet's Google Cloud's G Suite product, which offers cloud-based collaboration and productivity applications, garnered more than three million paying customers by the end of the year.\n\nGoing into 2017, Alphabet will be up against a strong benchmark: itself. With a tough year-over-year comparison of 20% revenue growth in 2016, the company will need to continue executing well across Google advertising and YouTube, as well as its smaller businesses like hardware and cloud. Further, while Alphabet's other bets are still too small to help overall revenue growth in 2017, investors should continue to look for promising signs from the segment this year.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Rumors leaked that salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM ) or Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), among others, would buy the microblogging giant. Salesforce seemed the likely buyer, as it would have filled a void in the company's social networking.\n\nSource: Christopher via Flickr\n\nOnce TWTR traders got hold of a possible bidding war, Salesforce did what was best for shareholders by dropping off the list of potential buyers.\n\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, went on to buy LinkedIn for $26.2 billion.\n\nRenewed buyout hopes resurfaced this month, however, when Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) said it would buy Fabric on Jan 18. So, why did Twitter not sell itself and give Fabric away for free?\n\nTwitter's brand is powerful, but users are migrating from Facebook to Instagram and Snapchat . Fixing Twitter will require too much money and energy, even for a $550 billion dollar company like Alphabet, which simply does not have the appetite to compete against Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ).\n\nBut Fabric is a mobile developer platform whose strength is in performance tracking. Buggy apps get fixed fast on this platform, thanks to the superior bug reporting. By focusing on its core competency of mobile app development, Alphabet will continue finding growth in mobile.\n\nTwitter's Cash Balance Goes Up\n\nTwitter's sale of Fabric is puzzling because it does not need to sell assets to survive. The microblogging site generates positive cash flow, has over $5 a share in cash and trades at a book value of just 2.5 times. FB's price-book ratio is around seven.\n\nWhen Twitter reports quarterly results on Feb. 9, it will likely report another quarter of positive FCF. Still, both GOOG and TWTR benefit from the Fabric sale. Twitter divests itself from a non-core business and Alphabet gains another tool for mobile.\n\nAlphabet Buying TWTR Makes Sense\n\nTwitter's real-time news and user post signals benefit Alphabet's search engine algorithm for news. Projected to report slowing growth in the next five years, GOOG has plenty of resources to make Twitter a better social network.\n\nFiscal Years Ending% Growth58.1%15.1%9.8%8.3%8.8%7.5%% of Revenue-3.1%28.0%29.9%31.4%35.6%40.0%\n\nSource: finbox.io\n\nValuation\n\nAssuming a discount rate as low as 10%, Twitter is worth at least $20 a share:\n\n10.00% 9.00% 8.00%$21.49 $26.86 $36.83\n\nSource: finbox.io\n\nYou may access the model and enter your own assumptions here .\n\nBottom Line on TWTR Stock\n\nFew shareholders have any faith Twitter's business will get better. Its CEO is only part-time and management is not capitalizing on shifting trends. This weakens TWTR against Instagram and Snapchat.\n\nManagement has lots of work ahead before remaking itself as a top destination for real-time news and commentary.

The device is upgraded from the company's former Cardboard VR headsets that were (wait for it) made out of cardboard.\n\nThe View is an upgrade from the basic mobile VR unit and has a stylish design, soft-touch fabric, and a head strap to keep it on your head (most of the Cardboard versions had to be held up by hand). It also comes with a wireless remote that allows users to interact with VR content, like casting a fishing line, swinging a bat, or navigating around VR worlds.\n\nIn all, the View and its remote were a big step forward for Google as it launched its Daydream VR platform where users can access video content and VR games. But as much of a leap forward as the View was for Google's mobile VR plans, the Zellweger hire indicates that Google is already moving on to bigger plans.\n\nGoogle already dominated sales of mobile VR headsets in 2016, according to SuperData research, and sold 20 times more of its headsets than all of its competitors combined. With this lead, and more focus on headsets seemingly coming, Google appears perfectly positioned to benefit from mobile VR for years to come. Using Zellweger to help expand into more VR headset designs -- or possibly bringing higher-end units to market -- could help Google set itself apart even more.\n\nMobile VR is one of the fastest-growing segments of virtual reality and is where most of the early VR user adoption will happen. Conservative estimates peg the VR market at around $30 billion by 2020, and higher estimates put it at $70 billion by the same time.\n\nIf we take the conservative estimate, about one-fifth of those revenues will come from hardware, while the rest will come from software. Google is clearly looking to lead in both the software and hardware segments with the Daydream platform and Daydream View, and adding more products, or slightly more expensive ones, could help lure more consumers into the market. Google's Daydream View costs just $49 right now, but a headset with more features could go for more.\n\nIt's still unclear how exactly Google plans to use Zellweger, but the hire is a clear indication that the company is already focusing on its next iterations of the Daydream View headset. That should help Google build on its already massive lead in the mobile VR headset space, and could eventually help bring more users to its Daydream platform.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares)\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Luckily, I caught an uptrend and the profits came quickly so I booked them. This week I want to reset to try and repeat performance - but this time I have an earnings report to worry about.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTraders are fickle around earnings. The short-term reaction to an earnings report is more gambling than investing, regardless of the quality of the report. Often enough great company stocks come under selling pressure even on solid reports.\n\nFB stock is a mega cap and usually they takes cues from other mega cap earnings reactions. We recently saw a split decision between Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ).\n\nEventually these companies are winners; they are beasts with little chance of debacles. But for the short term, investors have to contend with the knee-jerk reactions.\n\nHaving said that, there are ways I can trade earnings reports without much out-of-pocket risk. Last week I sold puts in MSFT to buy its calls. The trade was an easy win.\n\nThis week, I will set up a trade to benefit from a positive reaction to FB's earnings. Experts think that Wall Street will not be impressed by what FB stock management has to report and that the risk is to the downside. I want to bet on the opposite but without much immediate risk.\n\nFB Stock Trades\n\n\n\nClick to EnlargeThe Trade: Buy Facebook Mar $135 calls. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $3 per contract to open. To profit, I need FB stock to rally past my strike before mid March. I could change this trade to a debit call spread to lower the entry cost. So I would instead buy the $135/$140 debit call spread and only spend $1.40 per contract. The trade-off is that with the spread, I cap my maximum profit to $3.60 per contract.\n\nI usually like to lower my entry cost especially when volatility is high so I need to cautiously sell options.\n\nThe Bank: Sell the Facebook Dec $100 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $3.80 per contract. This trade has an 85% theoretical chance of success and a 18% price buffer from current price.\n\nI only sell naked puts if I am willing and able to own the stock at the strike sold. IF FB stock falls below $100 per share this year I would be put the stock. Anything lower than $96 per share would be losses for me.\n\nThe Twist: Selling naked puts is not suited for every risk profile. So I can change the bank trade to being a credit put spread instead. Selling a spread makes the trade's maximum risk finite. For example, I can sell the FB Dec $100/$95 credit put spread. I collect $1.06 per contract to open. If successful, this trade yields 22% on money risked.\n\nThis is one of those occasions where I could do either or both. Some traders don't like selling risk into an earning report. I don't mind doing it with quality stocks like FB. I also usually do it far out in time and away from current levels.\n\nI am not required to hold option trades through expiration. I can close them at any time for partial gains or losses.\n\nNicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com .

The company is also seeking an injunction to prevent the defendants from engaging in further unlawful and/or unfair business acts and practices directed at Tesla and its employees.\n\nIn response, Aurora reportedly said, \"Tesla's meritless lawsuit reveals both a startling paranoia and an unhealthy fear of competition.

But beyond company fundamentals, there are regulatory reasons to be worried about the future of autonomous vehicles. Here are three things you need to know before you turn the key on driverless-car stocks.\n\nImage source: Waymo (Alphabet)\n\n1. Driverless cars have killed, but they may be safer than humans.\n\nLast May, the driverless-car dream turned into a nightmare. A Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S owner had Autopilot engaged on a highway when a truck drove across its path. Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the trailer because of its white color against a sunny sky, resulting in the first recorded death resulting in part from a driverless-car technology failure.\n\nWhile this tragic crash has rightly attracted the attention of regulators, investors, and concerned citizens, it's important to put this occurrence into perspective. Every year, 35,000 drivers and passengers die on America's roads -- that's equivalent to one death every 15 minutes, and 94% of those are caused by human error. Given driverless cars' overall track record, the safety comparison between human- and computer-driven cars clearly points to an automation advantage.\n\nThese sorts of empirical analyses are important for investors and can be even more essential when alarming news (such as a car crash) emerges that might cause a short-term stock price swing. On the first trading day after news of the crash was announced, Tesla Motors stock dropped 4%, but it bounced back up for a 2% overall increase by the end of the day. Steady investors can ignore the swings and focus on statistics instead.\n\n2. Not all self-driving cars are created equal\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has defined a five-level continuum to determine how self-driving a car really is. At Level 0, the human driver does everything. At Level 4, the human does nothing. Self-driving-car stocks have taken different approaches to deciding just how driverless they want their cars to be, but most have come to the conclusion that semi-driverless cars can actually be the most dangerous. That's because between level 0 and 4, humans might have to take over when something goes wrong -- and humans are generally terrible at reacting quickly and safely. That's why companies that aren't innovating beyond assisted automation may soon be left behind.\n\nThose that are going for full automation, such as Ford , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , and Volvo, may be the ones that ultimately become market leaders, even if their technology isn't currently widespread. In this case, investors should make sure to not err on the side of picking semi-driverless models over autonomous prototypes. For example, Alphabet's stand-alone company Waymo, which doesn't have a steering wheel and is still considered by most to be a prototype, may actually be a better investment than \"proven\" lane-departure warning systems, readily available on almost all high-end vehicles.\n\n3. Self-driving-car companies want to be regulated.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nCompanies are often at odds with regulators, spending billions of dollars on lobbying to ensure politicians steer clear of market meddling. Ford, Alphabet, Lyft, Uber, and Volvo Cars are taking an opposite approach. Last April, they established the \" Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets \" to \"work with lawmakers, regulators, and the public to realize the safety and societal benefits of self-driving vehicles.\" Last month, the group's legal counsel penned an op-ed in The Hill calling for a \"single national framework\" to align the country's regulation and cut down on conflicting local laws and regulations that could bring driverless-car innovation to a standstill. For an industry as emerging as driverless cars, this serves as a smart reminder that investors shouldn't consider regulation to be evil -- rules are important and can enable the most innovative companies to push ahead with production.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nSelf-driving-car stocks are hot, and in 2017 they may attract more attention than ever before. Investors who know the facts and stick with the stats are likely to come out ahead, so be sure to keep these three points in mind when making your next self-driving-car stock pick.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Treasury bonds were stronger, the dollar was stronger, gold lost 0.1%. and crude oil reversed some of its recent strength by falling 1.1%. The drop in oil boosted the ProShares UltraShort Crude Oil (NYSEARCA: SCO ) recommended to Edge subscribers to a 2.4% gain.\n\nHealthcare stocks led the way with a 0.8% gain while energy was the laggard, down 0.9%. A number of retailers were hit as well, with Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT ) losing its 200-week moving average for the first time since 2011, as Trump seemed to warm to the idea of a border tax that would increase the cost of goods sold.\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) gained 1.1% after reporting a fourth-quarter earnings per share beat 4% ahead of estimates thanks to results from its cloud computing group.

For the quarter, the company reported 22% year-on-year growth in revenues to $26.04 billion, in line with our expectation. On a constant-currency basis, revenues grew 24%. In line with our assessment in the pre-earnings note, much of the growth was driven by mobile search and YouTube.\n\nGoogle segment revenues for the quarter were $25.80 billion and were up 22% over the prior year. While Google's operating profit grew by 16.9%, the operating margin declined by 130 basis point to 30.6%. In contrast, Alphabet's moon-shot 'other bets' generated revenues of $262 million and operating losses of $1.08 billion.\n\nThe core search business continued to witness pricing pressure, while ad volume for the company continued to grow. Furthermore, the movement in Google Sites paid clicks and CPCs primarily reflects the continued growth in YouTube, TrueView and mobile search. Furthermore, the company said that the momentum in its play store sales and programmatic platform were instrumental in revenue growth in Q4. In this note, we will discuss Google's results.\n\nClick here to see our complete analysis of Alphabet\n\nNumber of Clicks Grows Due To Programmatic Buying Even As Cost-Per-Click Continues To Decline\n\nWe currently estimate that PC search ads, mobile search ads and YouTube ads contribute over 60% to the firm's value. Cost per click (CPC), a metric that measures the price paid for the number of times a visitor clicks on a search ad, has been in a steady decline for the past few years. This quarter, it declined by 16% on Google websites and 11% on network member sites. Furthermore, aggregate cost per click declined by 15% during the quarter. The recent trend is indicative of geographical mix, device mix, currency headwinds and property mix.\n\nAdditionally, Google is looking to monetize its properties through its programmatic platform, which matches relevant ads with content. However, this is negatively impacting Google's CPC as the programmatic platform does away with inefficiencies of improper ad matching. As a result, the company's top line growth from search ads across network member and owned sites has failed to match the growth in search volume. Google is focusing on its programmatic businesses including AdMob, AdExchange, DoubleClick Bid Manager, and these continue to grow at a strong rate. This has resulted in an increase in ad volumes and 36% improvement in aggregate paid clicks for Google. Furthermore, video ads also witnessed a decline in RPM due to the rapid growth of YouTube, where a majority choose to use TrueView ads and the contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager, which monetizes at lower rates than ad clicks on Google.com. Going forward, as Google improves its programmatic platform, we expect that the growth in online advertising paid clicks will continue but still weigh on CPC.\n\nPlay Store And Hardware Revenues Grew\n\nThe Google Phone division makes up approximately 6.8% of its estimated total value, according to our model. Google, with 90% market share, dominates the mobile search engine market. One of the key reasons for this dominance is its flagship Android OS, which has witnessed excellent adoption and penetration in the smartphone space. The company reported that Google play witnessed double-digit growth across the world and growth was over 70% in countries like India, Turkey and Mexico.\n\nAs part of its strategy, it remains focused on building the mobile ecosystem that has the right ad formats and measurement to take advantage of all the platform ads. Google has launched artificial intelligence based Assistant app that helps users with advanced search. Its mobile services like Now on Tap, which essentially uses machine learning, lets user access additional useful information based on recent search and present location. We believe that, as Google's mobile strategy for content and ads continues to evolve, the ads and content revenues will increase in coming years. This will also lead to growth in sales of Google phone and Home hardware.\n\nPerformance Of Other Bets\n\nIts Other bets business, which includes Fiber, Verily, Calico, Nest, self-driving cars, and incubation activities in X, reported revenue of $262 million and operating losses of $1.08 billion on a quarterly basis. Other Bets capital expenditures were $504 million for the quarter, primarily reflecting investment in the Fiber business. Nevertheless, the company did report key business wins across Verily, Calico, Nest and Waymo.\n\nWe are in the process of updating our model. We currently have a $821 price estimate for Google , which is in line with the current market price.\n\nUnderstand How a Company's Products Impact its Stock Price at Trefis\n\nView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):\n\nGlobal Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap\n\nMore Trefis Research", "Is Google Fiber the culprit? Image source: Google.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) reported fourth-quarter earnings last night, missing earnings expectations despite a beat up top. Beyond the core ad business, there were a few interesting developments worth highlighting. Expectedly, \"Other Bets\" continues to bleed out, generating an operating loss of nearly $1.1 billion on revenue of $262 million. The company lost $3.6 billion on these side bets throughout the full year. Hardware revenue is growing amid the company's broader push into products like the Pixel phone and new mesh Wi-Fi router system, among others.\n\nData source: SEC filings. Chart by author.\n\nBut by far the most puzzling aspect of the release was a one-time charge of $320 million that Alphabet mentioned in passing but would not elaborate much on. No one knows what the charge is for, and that's a decent chunk of change.\n\nThe $320 million question\n\nCFO Ruth Porat attributed most of the charge to \"equipment,\" and it came out of cost of revenue: \"However, it's important to note the cost of revenues was also affected by approximately $320 million of one-time charges related to equipment and other adjustments which were unrelated to hardware.\"\n\nAnalysts tried to pry more detail out of Porat, with little success. When asked by two separate analysts, one of whom noted that it's \"a relatively sizable amount,\" she mostly reiterated her previous remark:\n\nAnd in terms of, you noted the one-time item, there were really two, that I'm actually going to call out. One was in the cost of revenues. I noted that equipment costs were elevated by some one-time charges, and so there was some pressure there. And then, the other item I noted was, with respect to our tax rate. ... So on the first one, trying to be helpful in giving you dimension and impact on cost of sales, but really not much more to add there. I think the other point is, is you're thinking about the hardware business, it was gross margin positive. There was just some other variables in there.\n\nThe charge is a one-time item, which investors are often willing to brush aside, but it's still confounding. It's also worth noting that if it weren't for this charge, Google likely would have beat the bottom-line consensus estimate, so it's not insignificant. Probably the most compelling theory comes from J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth (via Tech Trader Daily ), who believes it's related to Google Fiber.\n\nIf you recall, Google said in late October that it would \"pause\" its expansion plans, although it would continue strengthening its Fiber technology in its existing markets. That also entailed laying off Fiber employees, and Google Access CEO Craig Barratt would be stepping down (but remain onboard as an advisor). Google Access is the subsidiary that includes the company's ambitions to improve internet access, which includes Fiber and is accounted for in Other Bets.\n\nThis could help explain the $223 million sequential increase in Other Bets' operating loss. The incredibly high costs associated with expansion have always been a major hurdle to growing Fiber's footprint , and the change of strategic direction for Fiber could have resulted in writing down a bunch of equipment that had already been purchased.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While revenue jumped 22% to $26.1 billion and surpassed analysts' consensus estimate (via Thomson Reuters) for revenue of $25.2 billion, the company's earnings of $9.36 per share fell short of a projection for $9.64.\n\nAs investors digest the information from Alphabet's latest report, here's a look at some of the most insightful comments from the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. In these quotes, management discusses the success of the new Google-branded hardware, further opportunity in advertising, and what it considers the three biggest bets for the company beyond its core ad business.\n\nGoogle Pixel. Image source: Google.\n\nAlphabet's core search business hasn't peaked -- far from it\n\nAfter pointing to the company's impressive 20% consolidated revenue growth in 2016, which management emphasized is actually 24% when excluding the impact of currency headwinds, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat emphasized (via a Reuters transcript ) the opportunity ahead:\n\nThis performance is a testament to the ongoing innovation that is driving our success in mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising, each of which we believe has only begun to scratch the surface. We remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped.\n\nThese could become major revenue drivers\n\nWith about 86% of Alphabet's total revenue coming from advertising, it's always nice to get an update on whether the company is seeing success on diversifying its revenue sources. To this end, Alphabet made excellent progress in its fourth quarter. Here's what Porat had to say:\n\nAlongside these [advertising] businesses, we are focused on growing additional revenue streams within Google over the medium- and long-term. In 2016, our other revenue line grew 41% on a full year basis reflecting the growth in our Play, hardware and cloud businesses. We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube. We're investing in our cloud and hardware businesses, as well as our newer non-ad revenue sources for YouTube, in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years.\n\nAlphabet's other revenue growth in the Google segment (not to be confused with Alphabet's \"other bets\") was even more impressive in the company's fourth quarter specifically. Fourth-quarter other revenue soared 62% year over year, to $3.4 billion, accounting for 13% of total revenue, up from 10% of revenue in the year-ago quarter. Management cited hardware, the Google Play app store, and its cloud business as key drivers for the segment.\n\nGoogle Home. Image source: Google.\n\nGoogle-branded hardware looks promising\n\nDrilling down more narrowly on the company's nascent hardware business, which received some extra attention from the company in the fourth quarter when Google launched its voice-activated smart speaker (Google Home) and a new smartphone (Google Pixel), management was optimistic about how new hardware is performing in the marketplace. Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained:\n\nWe introduced a new family of beautiful hardware devices in October that are made by Google, led by Google Home and our Pixel phone which feature the Google Assistant built in. We're thrilled with the reception, as well as the really happy customers we saw over the holiday season. In particular, Google Home was a very popular present that many people opened on Christmas morning. We have committed to this for the long-term, as a great way to bring a beautiful seamless Google experience to people. The early signs are promising, and you can expect us to see us expand our offerings thoughtfully.\n\nAlphabet's three big bets\n\nPichai said that beyond its core advertising business, the company distinctly views \"YouTube, cloud and hardware\" as \"three of our biggest bets.\" So investors should keep an eye on these areas as Alphabet continues to grow its business.\n\nManagement's extreme confidence in incremental opportunity in Alphabet's core search business, along with significant and promising growth in YouTube, cloud, and hardware, continues to make a great case for owning this stock. Not only is the company strengthening the competitive position of its core business, but it's also diversifying its revenue while simultaneously opening the doors to meaningful opportunities beyond advertising.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 20,000 points for the first time in history.\n\nNot only is General Electric a component of the Dow 30, it was a strong contributor to the record. GE stock turned in a 1.23% performance against its prior session. The average gains for the Dow-listed companies on the record-breaking day was only 0.6%, which is surprisingly low.\n\nIn fact, there were only six companies that posted better numbers than GE, and these were the usual suspects. In increasing order, they were International Business Machines Corp . (NYSE: IBM ), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS ), JPMorgan Chase & Co . (NYSE: JPM ), Apple Inc . (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and standout Boeing Co (NYSE: BA ), which ringed up an impressive 4% move.\n\nBesides the obvious point that these companies are proudly red, white and blue, it's easy to see why they performed so well over the others. President Donald Trump has promised fewer regulations stymieing business, more support for the military industrial complex and keeping jobs stateside. General Electric belongs among the titans of American industry; hence, yesterday's robust gains.\n\nBut is the recent surge of GE stock based on optimism for President Trump, or a reaction from pronounced volatility? The answer to that question is critical for investors.\n\nGE Stock Is Exciting, and That's Bad!\n\nGE has shed its boring image, but for all the wrong reasons.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nWhile it's very early into the new year, nevertheless, it's worth pointing out that shares are down 4%. I should also mention that at this price point, GE stock is firmly below its 50-day moving average, and only a hair above its 200-DMA.\n\nI don't think the volatility should be ignored as a bunch of technical mumbo jumbo. Just a few days ago, General Electric shares were down 6%.\n\nMore worryingly, traders haven't pushed the needle that far since GE faltered under the weight of an uninspiring and anemic fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 earnings results.\n\nRightfully, people are concerned. True, GE stock is a reliable investment, making steady gains through all sorts of economic cycles. At the same time, its stable nature can work against the investor if there's a sharp downfall. It may take an inordinate amount of time for General Electric to gain 10%, but it could be gone in a flash. As an example, GE returned 6% last year - and we've basically burned through two-thirds of that profit.\n\nI don't care how high the dividend yields are for General Electric. No one can afford to lose that much capital and justify the losses due to the passive income. Unless GE stock was offering double digits, it's a bad deal. Of course, the question would then become, why are they offering double digits?\n\nJust Stay the Course With General Electric\n\nSo should potential buyers heed the warning? Absolutely, they should! GE stock has formed an \"inside day\" pattern against the losses incurred by the feeble earnings report. Unless shares can quickly fill the technical gap, momentum definitely leans bearishly. Attempting to catch a falling knife here would not be the greatest idea.\n\nThat said, the month of January is GE stock's kryptonite . The last three Januarys produced a shockingly bad loss of 6%. Since 1962, General Electric has averaged only 0.8% returns for the opening month of the calendar. In nominal terms, there were only 28 positive Januarys over that time frame. That means that GE stock is as useful as a coin toss during the NFL playoffs.\n\nHowever, the industrial titan is a consistent winner over the long run. By the end of the year, GE stock is good for an average 13% return. Nominally, 39 years ended sunny side up. This current decade has been particularly robust, averaging over 15%.\n\nI've made this argument before, but it really comes down to your end goal. If you're looking for a hot growth stock, look elsewhere, please! If you want to bide your time and not rock your portfolio with risk, GE stock is a prudent choice.\n\nBut even reliable names have their off seasons. Watch General Electric closely, and wait for a baseline of technical support before going in too rich.\n\nAs of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Has a History of Winning appeared first on InvestorPlace ." ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.4753333333333332, 0.3364463786804213, 0.3364463786804213, 0.4614677516576249, 0.4278619528619528, 0.3659116809116809, 0.3994824016563145, 0.4525006725854182, 0.5430625300625299, 0.4767340067340068 ], "headline" : [ "Tesla Sues Former Exec For Stealing Secrets", "European Stocks Set To Open Weak On Lackluster Cues", "European Stocks Set To Open Weak On Lackluster Cues", "3 Self-Driving-Car Facts You Need to Know", "Trump Travel Ban On Muslim Countries Still In Place Despite Court Ruling", "Stocks Cool Their Heels Ahead of Fed, Jobs Report", "Alphabet Earnings: Mobile Search And YouTube Continues To Boost Revenues", "Analysts Can't Figure Out Alphabet's Puzzling $320 Million Charge", "4 Insightful Quotes From Alphabet Inc.'s Fourth Quarter", "Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Has a History of Winning" ], "sentiment_polarity" : [ 0.01533333333333332, 0.006340532989469161, 0.006340532989469161, 0.1490405866988145, 0.01327260702260701, 0.01096866096866097, 0.0513975155279503, 0.1564471592437694, 0.2780272246272247, 0.06177915518824609 ], "publish_date" : [ { "$date" : "2017-01-30T00:00:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-30T00:00:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-30T00:00:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-29T17:17:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-29T00:00:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-27T10:42:40.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-27T07:27:26.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-27T07:00:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-27T06:05:00.000+0000" }, { "$date" : "2017-01-27T17:34:14.000+0000" } ] }

( TSLA ) sued the former director of its Autopilot program, accusing him of taking confidential information about the company's driver-assist system and trying to recruit at least a dozen former colleagues to a new startup, according to Bloomberg reports.\n\nSterling Anderson started working last summer on the new autonomous-car venture, AuroraÂ Innovation LLC, before his departure from the company in December, Tesla alleged Thursday. Anderson has been collaborating with Chris Urmson, the former head of Google's self-driving car project, according to a complaint filed in state court in San Jose, California.\n\nThe report noted that the electric-car maker seeks a court order barring Anderson, Urmson and Aurora Innovation from recruiting Tesla employees and contractors for one year after Anderson's termination date. The Palo Alto, California-based company also wants an order blocking any use of Tesla's proprietary information related to autonomous driving. Urmson and Anderson hadn't announced their startup prior to the lawsuit.\n\nhttp://www.rttnews.com\n\nThis article appears in: News Headlines", "InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe world's biggest and most recognizable all-things-internet name Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) reported its fourth-quarter numbers after the bell, and they fell unusually short of estimates.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFor the quarter ending in December, the company formerly known as Google earned $9.36 per share versus expectations of $9.63 .\n\nAlphabet's top line of $26.06 billion compares favorably to analyst predictions for revenue of $25.22 billion. The company reported a profit of $8.67 per share of GOOGL stock in the same quarter from a year earlier, when it drove sales of $21.33 billion.\n\nThe numbers interrupt a long-term streak of forward, even if not perfect, fiscal progress. Alphabet has topped estimates in five of the past seven quarters.\n\nCFO Ruth Porat commented on the Alphabet earnings report:\n\n\"Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional - with revenues up 22% year on year and 24% on a constant currency basis. This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube. We're seeing great momentum in Google's newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets.\"\n\nGOOGL shares were 2.1% lower in after-hours trading.\n\nNew Focus on Hardware Going Well\n\nAlphabet, while it was still called Google, was founded primarily as a web search engine, and that's still the lion's share of its revenue mix. Though aggregate cost-per-click fell, continuing a long (and industry-wide) trend of deterioration, with another 9% year-over-year decline, that dip continues to be more than offset by a sheer increase of volume.\n\nAggregate paid clicks grew 20% on a year-over-year basis. Google - the search engine and its ancillary products and services - contributed $25.8 billion worth of last quarter's revenue, and was responsible for $7.88 billion of the $8.5 billion in Alphabet's operating income.\n\nAlthough search and ads are still its bread-and-butter business, the company has recently begun the development of hardware and Internet of Things devices. The highest-profile of these new initiatives is the so-called Pixel phone. Although the company had brought smartphones to the market in the past - like the Nexus - those were mostly third-party/branded handsets. The Pixel is a true, home-grown, in-house smartphone from Google that's designed to take aim at the popular iPhone line from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ).\n\nBloomberg recently reported that Alphabet sold an estimated 1 million Pixels last quarter ; the company doesn't provide such details. That doesn't even come close to the 45.5 million iPhones Apple sold last quarter , but it's a very good first effort.\n\nThe Pixel is just one way Alphabet has remained relevant as consumers continue to migrate from desktops to mobile devices. Its Android operating system is now the OS of choice on nearly 90% of all handheld devices sold, funneling users to Google's apps, services and revenue-bearing display ads.\n\nDigital Is Still Important\n\nAnd the company is getting serious about squeezing more revenue out of its Google Play store. Going forward, Chromebooks will run all Android apps , making Chromebooks as well as more of its apps more marketable. The move poses a threat to the current king of laptop/notebook operating systems Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ).\n\nYouTube was another bright spot for Alphabet during its fourth fiscal quarter.\n\nAlthough garnering traffic has never been a problem for the online-video venue ( the site attracts more than 30 million viewers per day, who collectively watch nearly 5 billion clips every day ), optimizing the ad revenue YouTube generates has proven difficult. The organization seems to have finally found a winning formula though.\n\nAgain, Alphabet doesn't provide such specifics, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimated that YouTube generates $10 billion in annual ad revenue , or roughly a tenth of the company's total revenue. Porat also made a point of saying Mobile Search and YouTube led the company's revenue growth for the quarter.\n\nLooking Ahead for GOOGL Stock\n\nJust within the past few days, two experts have chimed in with bullish expectations for GOOGL shares. Specifically, Pacific Crest began coverage of Alphabet last week with a price target of $1,030 , and this week, Barron's opined GOOGL shares could reach $1,000 before the end of 2017. Those targets are approximately 20% higher than where the stock closed on Thursday.\n\nAnalysts expect Alphabet to earn $41.07 per share this year, on $104.07 billion in revenue. Those figures are 19% and 16% higher, respectively, than 2016's tally. Nothing about last quarter's numbers suggests the company won't reach those targets.\n\nAs of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Whiffs on Earnings, But Here's the Bright Side appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Google earnings (Shutterstock photo)\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet (GOOG) reported another strong set of financial results Thursday, beating Wall Street’s fourth quarter revenue estimates, which grew 22% year over year, thanks to the company’s continued dominance in advertising.\n\nOver the past couple of quarters, the Mountain View, Calif.-based tech giant has been working to offset declining mobile advertising value with higher clicks. The rate of revenue and earnings growth suggests that this strategy continues to pay off.\n\nIn the three months that ended December, Alphabet reported a net income rose to $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per, up from $4.92 billion, or $7.06 per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, when taking out one-time gains and costs, earnings were $9.36 per share, which misses estimates of $9.64 per share. Fourth quarter revenue rose 22% to $26.06 billion, easily topping Street forecast of $25.23 billion.\n\n“Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional -- with revenues up 22% year on year and 24% on a constant currency basis. This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube,” said CFO Ruth Porat in a statement. “We’re seeing great momentum in Google’s newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets.”\n\nIndeed, advertising revenue — up 17% to $19 billion — remains the company’s bread-and-butter business, accounting for some 90% of revenue. Google has, however, begun to show strength is its “Other Bets” — a segment that includes autonomous vehicles, virtual/augment reality headsets, its cloud business and, more recently, its smartphones. Revenue in that group came in at $262 million, surging 75% year over year from $150 million a year ago.\n\nGoogle’s cost-per-click, a key metric determining the value of an ad, fell 11% year-over-year this quarter. But aggregate paid clicks increased 20%, showing that the management continue to find ways to offset the decline. As have been the case for some time, the primary growth driver continues to be the strength in search and YouTube. Notably, Google Cloud, which hopes to compete with Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), has begun to show meaningful revenue growth.\n\nGoogle websites revenue rose 20% to $17.9 billion, while Google Network revenues increase 7% to $4.4 billion. As with the strong showing the third quarter, paid clicks on Google websites were up 43% year over year. Alphabet did not provide a forecast, but the consensus first-quarter 2017 estimates call for EPS of $9.34 on revenues of $23.74 billion. For the full year analysts forecast EPS of $41.07 on revenues of $104.07 billion.\n\nAlphabet stock traded lower on the report, down by about 2.5% at $834 in after-hours trading. I see this as a solid buying opportunity. With some patience, GOOGL stock should reach $1,050 in 2017, delivering 23% returns.", "Shutterstock photo\n\n\n\n\n\n(RTTNews.com) - Alphabet Inc., (GOOG, GOOGL), the parent company of Google, Thursday reported an increase in profit for the fourth quarter, reflecting largely revenue growth in search and advertising.

Despite the choppy trading on the day, the Dow still ended the session at a new record closing high.\n\nThe major averages eventually ended the day mixed. While the Dow rose 32.40 points or 0.2 percent to 20,100.91, the Nasdaq edged down 1.16 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 5,655.18 and the S&P 500 dipped 1.69 points or 0.1 percent to 2,296.68.\n\nThe lackluster performance on Wall Street came as traders seemed reluctant to make significant moves after yesterday's gains lifted the Dow above 20,000 for the first time.\n\nAT&T reported fourth quarter earnings that met analyst estimates, although the telecom giant reported weaker than expected revenues.\n\nAuto giant Ford reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings that matched analyst estimates on better than expected revenues.\n\nComcast reported fourth quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates. The company also announced a two-for-one stock split, raised its dividend by 15 percent, and increased its stock repurchase program authorization to $12 billion.\n\nHeavy equipment maker Caterpillar reported better than expected fourth quarter earnings but provided disappointing guidance.\n\nOn the U.S. economic front, the Labor Department released a report showing a bigger than expected rebound in initial jobless claims in the week ended January 21st.\n\nThe report said initial jobless claims climbed to 259,000, an increase of 22,000 from the previous week's revised level of 237,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to rise to 247,000.\n\nA separate report from the Commerce Department showed a sharp pullback in new home sales in the month of December, with sales falling to a ten-month low.\n\nThe Commerce Department said new home sales tumbled by 10.4 percent to an annual rate of 536,000 in December after jumping by 4.7 percent to a revised rate of 598,000 in November.\n\nSector News\n\nMany of the major sectors ended the day showing only modest moves, although substantial weakness was visible among gold stocks. Reflecting the weakness in the gold sector, the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index slumped by 2.6 percent.\n\nThe drop by gold stocks came amid a decrease by the price of the precious metal, with gold for February delivery sliding $8 to $1,189.80 an ounce.\n\nOil service stocks also came under pressure despite a jump by the price of crude oil, resulting in a 2.3 percent decline by the Philadelphia Oil Service Index.\n\nMeanwhile, airline stocks showed a strong move to the upside over the course of the session, driving the NYSE Arca Airline Index up by 1.3 percent.\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV) posted a standout gain reporting fourth quarter earnings and revenues that exceeded expectations.\n\nOther Markets\n\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved to the upside during trading on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index spiked by 1.8 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped by 1.4 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the major European markets turned in a mixed performance on the day. While the German DAX Index rose by 0.4 percent, the French CAC 40 edged down by 0.2 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index closed just below the unchanged line.\n\nIn the bond market, treasuries moved modestly higher over the course of the session after seeing early weakness. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, edged down by 1.5 basis points to 2.508 percent.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nEarnings news may continue to attract attention on Friday, with a slew of well known companies due to report their quarterly results.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC), and Microsoft (MSFT) are among the companies releasing their results after the close of today's trading.\n\nAdditionally, American Airlines ( AAL ), Chevron ( CVX ), and Honeywell (HON) are due to report their results before the start of trading on Friday.\n\nTraders are also likely to keep an eye on the day's economic data, with reports on durable goods orders, fourth quarter GDP, and consumer sentiment potentially impacting the markets.\n\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\n\nhttp://www.rttnews.com\n\nThis article appears in: Economy", "New Purchases: PG , IBM , PHO , CPB, NXPI, NWL, ALR, LMB, LITE, EL,\n\nAdded Positions:FB, AMZN, XOM, KO, MSFT, MLM, EPR, INTC, CVGW, JNJ,\n\nReduced Positions:DIS, HD, CBS, JPM, PNC, W, SATS, VZ, CUI, CEMI,\n\nSold Out:STJ, RAI, SPR, HE, D, CL, ALK, SBUX, SCSS, VA,\n\nFor the details of New Jersey Better Educational Savings Trust's stock buys and sells, go to http://www.gurufocus.com/StockBuy.php?GuruName=New+Jersey+Better+Educational+Savings+Trust\n\nApple Inc ( AAPL ) - 45,000 shares, 3.34% of the total portfolio.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to Facebook last night to announce that Hugo Barra will be joining FB to lead VR efforts , including Oculus. If the name sounds familiar it should. Barra is very well known in the technology industry.\n\nSource: Facebook\n\nSo who is Hugo Barra? He was in the news just last week when it was revealed he was leaving Chinese consumer technology giant Xiaomi .\n\nHe was hired in 2013 to lead that company's efforts to polish its image in western markets and help push its products into the U.S. market. At the time Barra said he was returning to his Silicon Valley roots, but gave no details.\n\nWhat Does Hugo Barra Bring to FB?\n\nPrior to Xiaomi, he served as Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google vice president of Android product management.\n\nIn his announcement of Barra's hire, Zuckerberg wrote:\n\n\"I'm excited that Hugo Barra is joining Facebook to lead all of our virtual reality efforts, including our Oculus team. Hugo's in China right now, so here we are together in VR. It seems fitting.\n\nI've known Hugo for a long time, starting when he helped develop the Android operating system, to the last few years he's worked at Xiaomi in Beijing bringing innovative devices to millions of people. Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform.\"\n\nFB's Oculus Challenges\n\nWhen Facebook bought Oculus for $2 billion in 2014, the prospects for its new virtual reality division seemed limitless. But for the last six months, the division has been struggling.\n\nFounder Palmer Luckey was bringing in bad press over his political views , complaints over the high prices for its Oculus Rift headset and the new Touch Controllers continued, and Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE: SNE ) unexpectedly began to gain traction with both consumers and game developers with its much more affordable Playstation VR. In December, Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe stepped down. Now, FB and Luckey are tied up in a lawsuit claiming the Oculus founder stole trade secrets and violated copyrights in order to develop his Oculus Rift VR headset.\n\nOn top of all this, the hype over virtual reality is beginning to fade. After being a major part of past Consumer Electronics shows, there was a feeling that VR wasn't particularly compelling at CES 2017 .\n\nIn short, it's understandable why FB wants to kickstart Oculus. An industry veteran like Hugo Barra -someone who is experienced in leading a critical division in a technology giant and skilled at promotion - may well be the answer.\n\nKickstarting Oculus\n\nWhen Barra takes over at Oculus, there are a few immediate challenges to take on. The lawsuit will have to be dealt with, but FB lawyers will be able to manage most of that.\n\nThe bigger issue in terms of getting consumers to buy into the Oculus rift is pricing. The Oculus Rift already has mindshare as the VR headset people think of. But where the Oculus Rift was once pretty much the only game in town, every major consumer technology company - except Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) - is offering virtual reality gear, and it's almost always cheaper.\n\nThat wouldn't be such a big deal if you were looking at $100 versus $75. But an Oculus Rift plus Touch Controllers goes for $798. Then you need a reasonably powerful PC (many computer owners would have to upgrade), which is at least another $1,000. In comparison, a complete Sony Playstation VR system (including the PS4) can be had for about $800. However, the Playstation VR headset is compatible with the original PS4 - which many gamers already own, so that brings their investment to just $500.\n\nLargely as a result of those cost differences, it's estimated Sony will have sold over 745,000 Playstation VR systems in 2016 , while projections are for the Oculus Rift to hit just 355,000.\n\nThe hire of Hugo Barra sets the stage for FB to aggressively promote the technical superiority of its Oculus virtual reality technology over that used by competitors like Sony. It's also a good move in promoting developer relations in an effort to boost the Oculus' lead in compelling VR content. And if he can find some wiggle room to get Oculus Rift pricing down a bit, Barra stands a good chance of turning things around for Facebook's virtual reality division in 2017.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Facebook Inc (FB) Hires Former Google Exec to Lead Oculus appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "CLOSE X Edit Favorites Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Once plugged in, an owner simply has to tap the button on the device to have it provide the information needed to log in to their account.\n\nFacebook already recommends YubiKey as a retailer that users can obtain the Security Keys from.

Samsung still isn't saying anything, but clues have been building that it will be later than normal. Now VentureBeat says it has the first photos of the elusive smartphone as well as an exact Galaxy S8 launch date.\n\nSource: Samsung\n\nSamsung's well-publicized disaster with the Galaxy Note 7 had a big ripple effect on the Galaxy S8.\n\nFirst, the company had to identify - without question - what had caused Galaxy Note 7 batteries to burst into flames. Then it had to pinpoint a fail-safe solution to the problem. After that, it had to hold an event where it publicly reviewed its findings and outlined the steps it had taken to ensure it never happens again. That event took place last week .\n\nGalaxy S8 Launch Pushed Back by Battery Concerns\n\nAs part of the battery investigation, Samsung also had to take measures to ensure the Galaxy S8 would not have similar problems, and that would have involved delayed finalization of the battery and related components. And you can bet the company has taken testing of the battery on its new flagship smartphone to new levels.\n\nAs a result, it seemed likely the Galaxy S8 launch date would be pushed from it's traditional Mobile World Congress unveiling in February. Samsung confirmed this during last week's event.\n\nThe Guardian , citing anonymous sources close to Samsung, pointed to a late March release date . Yesterday, VentureBeat's Evan Blass claimed to have specifics , saying the Galaxy S8 launch will take place at a Samsung Unpacked event in New York City on March 29.\n\nGalaxy S8 Details\n\nThe VentureBeat report also includes many technical details about SSNLF's new flagship handset(s), including photos.\n\nAs has been speculated, it appears that this year both Galaxy S8 smartphones will feature a curved \"Edge\" Super AMOLED display, but both will also lose the Home button so nearly the entire front is display - the camera remains at top. As a result, even though the overall dimensions stay roughly the same, both new smartphones will have larger displays than the Galaxy Note 7: 5.8-inches and 6.2-inches.\n\nThe fingerprint sensor has been moved to the back, and high tech biometrics are supplemented by an iris scanner. The charge port is the new USB-C standard, base storage moves to 64GB (with SD card expansion still offered) and unlike Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Samsung will reportedly keep the headphone jack.\n\nBy connecting to an optional dock, the Galaxy S8 will be able to be used as an Android computer. And it will feature Bixby, the advanced AI personal assistant Samsung gained when it purchased Viv in October.\n\nInterestingly, VentureBeat says the price of both models - which it says will go on sale April 21 - will be €100 (roughly $100) more than last year's models.\n\nThe Importance of the Galaxy S8 Launch\n\nIt can't be understated how critical this release is to SSNLF. After recalling 3 million Galaxy Note 7s', its reputation took a serious blow. Apple will be pulling out all the stops with the iPhone 8 later this year, as it celebrates the iPhone's 10th anniversary and mounts a major campaign to convince upgraders. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) released its first Google-branded smartphone in the Pixel Phone at the height of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, and a follow-up is expected this year.\n\nBoth rivals will be gunning to boost sales at Samsung's expense.\n\nIn the last quarterly sales report (from the end of October), Samsung's smartphone sales marketshare had dropped 13.5% compared to the previous year. The next quarter's numbers could be even worse. If the Galaxy S8 launch flops, Samsung's time at the top of the smartphone sales charts would likely be over.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Samsung (SSNLF) Expected to Launch Galaxy S8 on March 29 appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Shutterstock photo\n\n\n\n\n\n(RTTNews.com) - Following the lackluster performance seen in the previous session, stocks continued to show a lack of direction during trading on Friday.

The Nasdaq surged up by 1.9 percent, the Dow jumped by 1.3 percent and the S&P 500 advanced by 1 percent.\n\nTraders were also digesting the mixed batch of earnings news released by several big-name technology companies after the close of trading on Thursday.\n\nWhile Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported weaker than expected fourth quarter earnings, Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) both reported better than expected quarterly results.\n\nIn economic news, the Commerce Department released a report showing economic growth in the U.S. slowed by more than anticipated in the final three months of 2016.\n\nThe report said gross domestic product increased by 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter following a 3.5 percent jump in the third quarter. Economists had expected GDP to climb by 2.2 percent.\n\nEconomists noted that the slowdown was largely due to the impact of fluctuations in trade and said the third and fourth quarters together indicate a strong second half.\n\nA separate report from the Commerce Department showed durable goods orders unexpectedly declined in December amid a continued decrease in orders for transportation equipment.\n\nThe Commerce Department said durable goods orders fell by 0.4 percent in December after tumbling by a revised 4.8 percent in November.

The Chinese markets were closed on the day.\n\nMeanwhile, the major European markets turned in a mixed performance on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index increased by 0.3 percent, the German DAX Index dipped by 0.3 percent and the French CAC 40 Index slid by 0.6 percent.\n\nIn the bond market, treasuries saw further upside after turning higher over the course of the previous session. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, fell by 2.7 basis points to 2.481 percent.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe Federal Reserve is likely to be back in the spotlight next week, with the central bank due to announce its latest monetary policy decision on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, traders are likely to pay close attention to the accompanying statement.\n\nThe monthly jobs report is also likely to be in focus next week along with reports on personal income and spending, manufacturing and service sector activity, and labor productivity.\n\nOn the earnings front, ExxonMobil (XOM), MasterCard (MA), Pfizer (PFE), UPS (UPS), Apple ( AAPL ), Facebook ( FB ), Amazon ( AMZN ), and Visa (V) are among a slew of companies due to report their quarterly results next week.\n\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\n\nhttp://www.rttnews.com\n\nThis article appears in: Economy", "InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI recently shared a story on how to get free profits from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) stock. My profits came too fast, but luckily, now that the earnings are out, I have another chance to reset .\n\nMy interpretation of the GOOGL earnings is that the machine is still on rails. It's a money-making machine with multiple assets that have over a billion users. Management is still somewhat in check when it comes to extraneous spending on wild ventures. So I am left worrying only on Wall Street's perception when trading Alphabet stock.\n\nI am bullish in the long term, so I will sell someone a losing lotto ticket. The trick is to find a level where GOOGL is not likely to go and let time do the rest.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge The Trade: Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $650 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $16 per contract to open. This trade has a 90%-plus theoretical chance of success and a 23% price buffer from current levels.\n\nBy selling naked puts, I commit to buying the stock at my sold strike if GOOGL stock falls below it. So I only do this if I am willing and able to own the stock there. My breakeven level is $634 per share.\n\nUsually I like to hedge my trade by taking an opposing trade to balance. But in this uber bullish environment, I will leave it un-hedged. Short of a market crash I should have enough time to manage price gyrations.\n\nSelling naked puts is not suited for all portfolios or trader profiles. Risk tolerances vary, so I will offer an alternate trade with similar metrics. This will have finite risk, so a better fit would have more conservative approaches without changing the trade spirit.\n\nThe Alternate: Sell the GOOGL Jan 2018 $650/$640 credit put spread. This is also a bullish trade for which I collect $2.50 per contract to open. This also comes with a 90% theoretical chance of success. The yield on money risked would be 33%. All I need is GOOGL to stay above my sold spread to win.\n\nI am not required to hold these options trades through expiration. I can close any of them for partial gains or losses.\n\nNicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com .

Heck, I'm not even sure how I really feel about it. But there's a point where it's no longer useful to continuously ignore the giant pink elephant in the room. So here goes it - Asia will take over the world. There's not a darn thing anyone can do to stop the train. And Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) will have it no other way.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIn fact, Facebook is probably one of the few companies that recognize this demographic reality. Subsequently, FB stock is a very real challenger to the near-hegemonic dominance of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ).\n\nHonestly, the social media network is well on its way to becoming what Apple Inc . (NASDAQ: AAPL ) once was before copycat competitors entered the fray: a completely unique experience and solution with no natural predators.\n\nInterestingly, much of society is turning their back towards the demographic goldmine that Facebook stock is sitting on. The NFL celebrates \" Hispanic Heritage Month ,\" and Mexico City hosted a regular-season game last year. After activists blasted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences with the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, the film industry made dramatic changes. According to NBC News, the \"'African-American Film Critics Association declared 2016 the best year for blacks in cinema 'ever'.\"\n\nWhile these are profound steps towards diversity and inclusion, there's a glaring omission. According to researchers at the University of Southern California , \"'at least half or more of all cinematic, television, or streaming stories\" didn't portray a single Asian or Asian-American on screen.'\"\n\nThis \"yellow-out\" may be swept under the rug now, but mark my words, FB stock will change everything.\n\nAsian Markets Too Bigly for FB Stock to Ignore\n\nAs InvestorPlace contributor Craig Adeyanju notes, the Facebook stock price is all about the numbers, and the numbers look amazing! Adeyanju writes that with \"Facebook on course to reach 2 billion users this year without China, the opportunities become bigger once China allows FB in its country again. Keep in mind that China currently has the largest number of internet users globally.\"\n\nHe is so right - the number of China's internet users exceed that of the U.S. by a more than 150% margin. Those are bigly consumers that FB stock desperately wants to tap into. But they're not that desperate. China is often overused as a justification for buying Facebook stock or any number of investments. However, just scale up the picture a bit and you'll see why Mark Zuckerberg is so excited.\n\nThe majority of Earth's human population is Asian, period. Even if you were to open a \"heritage month\" for every race, color and creed in America, you would at most affect less than 5% of the world. Adding in the entire Latin American population would help, but the leverage would be less than Africa, and slightly more than Europe.\n\nAn investment in Facebook stock is simply a recognition of a changing world. Unfortunately, few have this ability. For example, Princeton University detailed evidence of discrimination in academia designed to \"cull\" Asian student populations. In contrast, from the perspective of FB stock, these demographic trends are to be embraced, celebrated and ultimately, profited.\n\nUntapped Riches Still Available for Facebook Stock\n\nI mentioned before that China is an overused argument. But when you drill deeper into the statistics, there's still a lot of gold for FB stock to mine. The perennial Asian powerhouse's internet penetration is just slightly above half the population. In contrast, the U.S. internet penetration is nearly 89%. That's the raw, low-hanging fruit from which Facebook stock can benefit.\n\nBut even in a place like Japan, where the internet penetration is more than 91%, there's still a viable opportunity for FB. As of the midway point of last year, there were 26 million Japanese Facebook subscribers. That's less than a 21% penetration rate for the company. Japan is actually an unheralded market: it has an incredibly educated, tech savvy population.\n\nIn many ways, that's a better prospect for FB stock rather than activating developing or frontier markets because of the existing infrastructure.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nBut the really exciting potential is that when developing countries reach the next stage, FB can spark a global revolution. Asia's total Facebook penetration rate is less than 14% - just marginally better than Africa. That means that the company's future is in Asian hands.\n\nThe North American market is near realistic capacity at 62%, while Latin America is not that far behind at 52%. Given the enormous economic growth in Asia, that's not a bad gig for FB stock.\n\nWhile the rest of the world is focused on the transition of power at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Facebook has been looking at a trend decades in the making. Indeed, the movement is inevitable and will have far-reaching consequences well outside our lifetimes. They only thing any company can do is to prepare for it, and FB has a substantial lead.\n\nAs of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Asia Will Take Over the World, and Facebook Inc (FB) Wants In appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Shares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) were down nearly 3% in Thursday's after-hours trading after the internet search giant released fourth-quarter 2016 results. But keeping in mind Alphabet stock opened the trading session at a fresh all-time high, as well as the fact that it doesn't provide specific quarterly financial guidance, the market's response isn't necessarily indicative of a disappointing quarter.\n\nLet's take a closer look at what drove Alphabet's latest results.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle's headquarters building. Image source: Alphabet, Inc.\n\nAlphabet's headline numbers\n\nQuarterly revenue climbed 22.2% year over year (24% at constant currency), to $26.064 million, and -- based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) -- translated to 23.4% growth in operating income, to $6.639 billion, and 8.3% growth in GAAP net income, to $5.333 billion. GAAP net income per share grew 7.1%, to $7.56, for both Class A and Class B shares.\n\nOn an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, which adds perspective by excluding items like stock-based compensation, operating income grew 24.5% year over year, to $8.485 billion, net income grew 9.1%, to $6.593 billion, and net income per share grew 8%, to $9.36. By comparison -- and though we don't usually pay close attention to Wall Street's quarterly demands -- analysts' consensus estimates called for higher adjusted earnings of $9.64 per share but more modest 18.3% growth in revenue, to $25.23 billion.\n\nCFO Ruth Porat added:\n\nOur growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional [...]. This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube. We're seeing great momentum in Google's newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets.\n\nMore specifically, here's a broad look how Alphabet's two primary operating segments (Google and \"other bets\") fared:\n\nMetric Three Months Ended Dec. 31, 2015 Three Months Ended Dec. 31, 2016 Year-Over-Year Growth Google segment revenues $21.179 billion $25.802 billion 21.8% Google operating income $6.744 billion $7.883 billion 16.9% Other bets revenues $150 million $262 million 74.7% Other bets operating income (loss) ($1.213 billion) ($1.088 billion) N/A\n\nDATA SOURCE: ALPHABET, INC.\n\nOn Google\n\nAlphabet's core Google business -- which includes the likes of Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Google Play, and Gmail, as well as Ads, Commerce, Apps, Cloud, and hardware products -- predictably represented the bulk of the company's consolidated revenue.\n\nWithin that, advertising revenue climbed 17% year over year, to $22.4 billion, or roughly 85.9% of Alphabet's total revenue (down from 88.3% last quarter, and just over 89% two quarters ago). Breaking it down further, ad revenue from Google's own properties climbed 20% year over year, to $17.968 billion, and ad revenue from network members' properties rose 7%, to $4.431 billion.\n\nAggregate paid clicks increased 36% year over year, including 43% growth in paid clicks on Google properties, and 7% growth in paid clicks on Google network members' properties. Meanwhile, aggregate cost-per-click -- a key measure that helps show how much Google makes per ad -- declined 15%, including 16% and 19% declines on Google properties and network members' properties, respectively. As I noted in my earnings preview earlier this week, declines in aggregate cost-per-click continue to stem from outsized growth at YouTube, where TrueView ads tend to reach consumers earlier in the purchase funnel so monetize at lower rates.\n\nFinally, other revenue within Google grew an impressive 62% year over year, to $3.403 billion, driven by broad strong growth in each of Google's hardware, Play, and Cloud subsegments.\n\nOn other bets\n\nSpeaking to Porat's mention of \"strong progress in Other Bets,\" remember that this segment is primarily comprised of early-stage, pre-revenue businesses operating in several disparate industries. As such, growth and profitability of the other bets segment can vary widely from quarter to quarter so is best viewed through a long-term lens.\n\nIn the meantime, other bets achieved respectable 74.7% year-over-year growth in fourth-quarter revenue, to $262 million, almost completely attributable again to sales of Nest connected home products, Fiber high-speed internet, and Verily longevity solutions. Other bets continued to remain solidly un profitable (for now), generating an operating loss of $1.088 billion, which was narrowed from a $1.213 billion operating loss in the same year-ago period. Even excluding stock-based compensation, other bets' operating loss would have been $927 million, compared to $1.082 billion excluding SBC in last year's fourth quarter.\n\nLooking forward\n\nAlphabet didn't offer specific forward financial guidance as per usual. But in a broader sense, management did suggest during the subsequent conference call that they plan to focus on not only continuing the momentum of their core advertising business in 2017 but also investing to further grow additional revenue streams as it works to diversify its business.\n\nAs Porat explained:\n\nWe remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped. Alongside these businesses, we are focused on growing additional revenue streams within Google over the medium and long term. In 2016, our \"Other\" revenue line grew 41% on a full-year basis reflecting the growth in our Play, hardware, and cloud businesses. We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development in non-advertising revenue streams from YouTube. We're investing in our cloud and hardware businesses, as well as our newer non-ad revenue sources from YouTube in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years.\n\nIn the end, apart from Alphabet's slight bottom-line shortfall relative to Wall Street's expectations, this was another strong performance, with continued admirable top-line growth from the global tech juggernaut. And with shares only enduring a modest pullback right now from all-time highs, I think Alphabet investors should be more than pleased with where their company stands.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Either poor service or a low quality product, the end result was always the desire to do less business with the given company.\n\nHowever, on the other side of the coin, there are those companies out there that go above and beyond, time and time again. Those are the companies I like to frequent, and I have always wondered if these types of firms-which have a long history of satisfying their customers-end up making better investments too.\n\nWell, in this edition of the Dutram Report , I talk to Kevin Quigg, chief strategist of ACSI Funds, for some insights into this topic and if this idea works as an investment.\n\nInside ACSI\n\nKevin is an expert in the American Customer Satisfaction Index, a benchmark that exists to find companies that customers either like, or would rather avoid. This is done by looking at a few key areas of the customer satisfaction process, including customer expectations, perceived value, and perceived quality.\n\nThis data has proven to be extremely popular with companies, as it helps them to keep tabs on the competition and to see their relative standing among their peers too. But the data can also be used to shape the outlook for companies and to see how they are trending in terms of customer satisfaction, which can help to show which companies are moving in the right direction.\n\nACSI's idea is that customer satisfaction leads to customer loyalty, which leads to additional consumer spending which ultimately leads to long-term stock appreciation. This intuitively makes sense, and now there is a way to use this strategy in ETF form.\n\nThe ETF\n\nThis is via ACSI Funds' American Customer Satisfaction Core Alpha ETF (ACSI). This product holds securities that have high ACSI customer satisfaction scores, with the theory being that these will outperform their low-satisfaction peers.\n\nCurrent holdings include well-respected names like Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Alphabet (GOOG) just to name a few, though there are dozens of names in the portfolio. And if you are wondering what is done for sectors where customer satisfaction levels aren't as readily available, such as energy or materials, big ETFs-such as XLE or XLB-are utilized in order to give more market-like exposure.\n\nBottom Line\n\nFor a more in-depth look at this index as well as its investable counterpart, make sure to listen to the podcast for additional information.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) rumor mill today is news of improvements to Siri. Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Tuesday.\n\nSiri Upgrade : A new report claims that Siri will be getting an upgrade when the 2017 iPhone comes out , AppleInsider notes. According to this report, the upgrade for Siri will enhance the virtual assistant so that it can better compete against others. The report claims that this update to Siri will be released with the launch of iOS 11, which will likely show up at the Worldwide Developers Conference this year. As it is now, Siri can't quite keep up with virtual assistants from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ).\n\nFind My AirPods : The new iOS 10.3 beta includes a feature to help users find their missing AirPods , reports MacRumors . This new feature is called \"Find My AirPods\" and it is designed to help owners of the wireless headphones keep track of them. The new beta also includes updates for HomeKit, CarPlay and more. It is available to developers registered with Apple. The beta comes out just one day after the tech company released the final version of iOS 10.2.1.\n\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.4 : The first beta for macOS Sierra 10.12.4 is now available to developers , 9to5Mac notes. The beta for macOS Sierra 10.12.4 includes several new features. The biggest one is the addition of a Night Shift feature. This lets users set their devices to slowly shift colors as the time changes. The feature has already been present on Apple's mobile devices for about one year. The beta also includes an update for Siri so users can ask about cricket scores. PDFKit APIs also got an update to improve the display of PDFs in apps with framework.\n\nThe post Tuesday Apple Rumors: Siri May Get a Major Upgrade in iOS 11 appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Samsung Electronics ( SSNLF ) published its Q4 2016 results on Tuesday, posting its highest operating profit in over three years, as a strong market for semiconductor products and the depreciation of the Korean Won helped the company overcome some setbacks faced by its smartphone division, following the discontinuation of its fire-prone Note 7 smartphones in Q3. While overall revenues remained almost flat at 53.33 trillion won ($45.8 billion) , operating profits expanded by about 50% to 9.22 trillion won ($7.9 billion). Samsung expects earnings to improve in 2017, as the company takes advantage of strong semiconductor pricing and stable demand, although the smartphone unit could face some challenges, amid higher marketing costs, slowing global smartphone shipment growth and mounting competition. Below we take a look at some of the key factors that drove Samsung's performance over the last quarter and what to expect in 2017.\n\nWe have a $1,340 price estimate for Samsung Electronics , which is slightly ahead of the current market price.\n\nSee our complete analysis for Samsung\n\nSemiconductor Unit Outperforms On Tight Supply And Samsung's High-End Focus\n\nSamsung's semiconductor business had a solid quarter, with revenues rising by 12.5% to 14.86 trillion won ($12.74 billion), and operating profits growing by about 77% to a record 4.95 trillion won ($4.24 billion), driven largely by the memory business. Supply-demand conditions in the memory market have been tight, with mobile OEMs increasing memory content on devices, effectively bolstering demand for NAND modules, while PC DRAM is seeing some under-supply, as major vendors have been reducing their production mix in favor of mobile DRAM, boosting prices. While Samsung has been benefiting from the broader market tailwinds, the company's technology edge and its focus on higher value products also appear to be paying off.\n\nFor instance, Samsung is focusing on high density/performance DRAM over commodity DRAM, while expanding process migration to the 48-layer 3D V-NAND. Samsung is looking improve its process technologies further in 2017, migrating to to 1x-nm DRAM and 64-layer V-NAND, driving down costs. The company's system LSI business, which manufactures processors, also aided Q4 earnings, driven by strong demand for mid-to-low end app processors. 2017 is expected to be an important year for the LSI division, as Samsung looks to ramp-up production of the next generation 10-nm products from its foundry operations. These chips, which could be a fixture of high-end smartphones in 2017, are touted to be more battery efficient, while offering better performance and a smaller form factor.\n\nSmartphone Business Largely Shrugs Off Note 7 Impact\n\nSamsung's smartphone division fared reasonably well, despite the Note 7 recall which occurred in late Q3. Although segment revenues declined by about 5.5% year-over-year to 23.61 trillion won ($20.27 billion), operating profits rose by about 12% to 2.5 trillion won ($2.15 billion). Profitability for the quarter was aided by strong sales of the company's flagship Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, which have higher margins, as well as sales of its mid-range smartphones such as the A and J series. That said, things are likely to remain subdued over Q1 2017, as Samsung is increasing its marketing spending in order to rebuild its brand following the Note 7 crisis. Moreover, the company's upcoming Galaxy S8 flagship is likely to launch in Q2, moving away from the March launch cycle that the company adopted with the S7. The upcoming device will be crucial to Samsung, as the company looks to restore its image as a vendor of cutting-edge smartphones, while contending with increasing competition in the high-end of the smartphone market as Apple preps to launch a completely redesigned iPhone later this year, while Google ramps up sales and distribution of its critically acclaimed Pixel devices.

(NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) is set to announce its earnings on January 26th. While we believe that its search company Google continued to dominate the online search ads market in 2016, its 'moonshot' (i.e., start-up) businesses, clubbed under other bets, are witnessing downsizing due to investment outlay.\n\nIn Q3, the company reported that its revenues grew by over 23% year over year to $22.45 billion. The performance measures for search, cost-per-click (CPC), continued to negatively impact growth. This decline was offset to some extent by the growth in aggregate clicks as Google's search products as adoption of its enhanced campaigns program continued to gain traction. This program, which combines ad marketing campaigns across mobile devices, desktops and laptops (i.e., across screens with different form factors), was instrumental in generating ad volume growth across both the display and search ad divisions.\n\nIn Q4, we believe that Google continued to focus on improving its display revenues from YouTube. Additionally, Google continued to sell more of the ads inventory through its programmatic platform, which is driving aggregate paid clicks and revenues across desktop and mobile verticals. However, the company continues to burn cash for its 'other bets' as the search for next multi-billion dollar money maker continues.\n\nClick here to see our complete analysis of Alphabet\n\nGoogle Revenue To Grow Despite Decrease In CPC\n\nTrefis currently estimates that PC search ads and mobile search ads contribute over 46% to the firm's value. During the year, Cost per click (CPC), a metric that measures the price paid for the number of times a visitor clicks on a search ad, has been on a steady decline. For the first nine months, it declined by an aggregate 11.3% on Google websites and 6.7% on network member sites. Furthermore, aggregate cost per click declined by 9% during the quarter. The trend in Google's search ads business is indicative of geographical mix, device mix, currency headwinds and property mix. Furthermore, the growth of TrueView ads on YouTube and the advent of the video programming platform has negatively impacted CPCs, as has the DoubleClick Bid Manager, which monetizes at lower rates than ad clicks on Google.com.\n\nDespite the decline in CPC, Alphabet continued to re-iterate in the year that its monetization rate for mobile devices has improved on the back of increased adoption of mobile ads. Furthermore, ad volume from mobile devices is growing. We believe that this trend will help the company to post growth in Q4 and for the 2016.\n\nYouTube Ads To Add To Topline, Weigh On CPC\n\nTrefis currently estimates that YouTube Ads contribute nearly 14% to the firm's value. In the previous quarter, the company reported that more than 1 billion monthly users are watching hundreds of millions of hours every single day. According to the company, YouTube has become the platform of choice for major brands, with a highly-engaged audience. Research also suggests that many users turn to YouTube to help them in making a decision about buying something by watching videos about it. Going forward, YouTube is an important growth driver for Google as online video ads are expected to grow exponentially. YouTube is forecast to record 3.5 trillion video views during 2016. Since online video remains a fast-growing segment within the overall digital ad market, we expect this to translate into high-revenue growth rate for the company in Q4 and in the ensuing year.\n\nHowever, Google is focusing on its video programmatic businesses including AdMob, AdExchange, DoubleClick Bid Manager, and these continue to grow at a strong rate. As Google is increasingly looking to monetize the video content through its programmatic platform, Trefis anticipates that CPC (Revenue per search) will continue to decline in Q4 and over the ensuing years. This will result in a lower than expected growth in topline. Although growth in search volume will likely offset the decline in Q4.\n\nMobile Content And Hardware Sales Set To Fillip Revenue\n\nGoogle, with 85% market share, dominates the mobile operating system market. The Android OS continues to witness excellent adoption and penetration in the smartphone market with the release of each subsequent version. The widespread adoption of Android will bolsters Google search as a user with an Android phone is more likely to use Google search compared to a user using another OS. Additionally, a user on an android phone is expected to download content from Google Play store, which helped the company to report growth in revenue from content in the first nine months of the year. In order to ensure that the company's flagship OS continues to rule the roost, Google has launched artificial intelligence based Assistant app that helps users with advanced search. Its mobile services like Now on Tap, which essentially uses machine learning, lets user access additional useful information based on recent search and present location. Last week, the company acquired Twitter's Fabric, a platform that helps mobile teams to build apps and analyse usage. We believe that, as Google's mobile strategy for content and ads continues to evolve, the ads and content revenues will increase in coming years. Nevertheless, the company will report increase in revenue for its Play store and mobile ads business during this Q4's earnings report, in our expectatation.\n\nDuring the year, Alphabet launched the Pixel smartphone to defend its mobile search ad business. With the introduction of the Pixel, the firm is looking to create a solid Android alternative to the iPhone, potentially allowing it to win over affluent customers. We expect that the company will disclose the sales number for its Pixel line of Smartphone during this earnings announcement. This will help us to ascertain whether the company was able to compete with Apple's iPhone in 2016.\n\nPerformance Of Other Bets\n\nIts Other bets segment, which includes Fiber, Verily, Calico, Nest, self-driving cars, and other businesses, reported revenue of $548 million and operating losses of $2.23 billion for the first nine months of the year. Other Bets capital expenditures were $884 million, primarily reflecting investment in the Fiber business. Over the past few months, Alphabet is scaling back its support for money-losing \"moonshot\" ventures to rein in costs and make these businesses accountable for their operations. Despite these efforts, we believe that these businesses will continue to bleed cash in Q4 and 2016, albeit at a slower rate.\n\nWe currently have a $821 price estimate for Alphabet , which is inline with the current market price.\n\nUnderstand How a Company's Products Impact its Stock Price at Trefis\n\nView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):\n\nGlobal Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap\n\nMore Trefis Research", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n\"What happened?\" It's a question often posed to celebrity crushes that are now decades past their prime. And it seems like an appropriate inquiry for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). GOOG stock is the anchor among the so-called \"FANG\" stocks, which include Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), Amazon.com, Inc . (NASDAQ: AMZN ), and the hot-running Netflix, Inc . (NASDAQ: NFLX ). Arguably, GOOG is the most culturally significant of the bunch, yet its recent performance has left a lot to be desired.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFor 2016, GOOG stock returned a whopping 4% even. To put that underperformance into perspective, Alphabet Inc gave shareholders 48% returns on average during the 2000s decade when it was first introduced to the markets.\n\nInclusive of last year, its lifetime average is now a little bit above 30%. In fact, compared to the other FANGs, GOOG stock is the absolute worst. And while it's almost identical to Facebook's overall performance, both Amazon and Netflix put Alphabet Inc to shame.\n\nThat's the kind of post-mortem talk you hear on CNBC when reality finally catches up to a speculative company. Certainly, it's not the kind of metric you expect from a bigger-than-life-itself organization like GOOGL. I mean, this is a company that was the centerpiece of a Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson movie - and they totally agreed to it!\n\nBut just like the movie's plot, outside appearances can be deceiving. Here are a few reasons why you should still give GOOG stock a chance.\n\nGOOG Is More Than a Search Engine\n\nFirst off, Alphabet Inc isn't just a search engine. Yes, I completely understand the argument that the vast, overwhelming majority of its multi-billion dollar business derives from advertisements. However, there are unmistakable signs of diversity.\n\nAs InvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth points out , in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, \"GOOGL generated $2.4 billion in other revenues, 39% higher year-over-year and 12% sequentially. This represented 10.9% of the Google segment's overall revenue of $22.3 billion. For the first nine months of the year, Google's other revenues came to $6.7 billion, 31% higher than a year earlier.\" Essentially, Alphabet Inc can spin off a brand new business separate from advertisements, and it would do just fine.\n\nIndeed, GOOG stock is backed by coverage of over 157 products , according to another InvestorPlace colleague, Aaron Levitt. While a good chunk of the offerings are web-based applications, such as Gmail, Maps and Chrome, \"the firm has continued to plow some big-time dollars onto the physical device market.\" As we move forward, GOOG stock may be less recognized as an app investment, and more as a consumer electronics investment similar to Apple Inc . (NASDAQ: AAPL ) or Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE: SNE ).\n\nAs both Ashworth and Levitt note, diversification towards physical devices and non-core businesses don't necessarily endear folks to GOOG stock. Many of these divisions are money losers. The Motorola venture was a particularly rotten deal.\n\nHowever, I wholeheartedly agree with Ashworth's thesis: \"As painful as it is for investors to see Alphabet pour good money after bad into its Other Bets, GOOGL stock depends on it. Because its legacy business likely won't be this profitable 10 years from now.\"\n\nAlphabet Inc Has the Ultimate Trump Card\n\nPerhaps most analysts bullish towards GOOG stock have laid out similar arguments - Alphabet Inc is more than just a one trick pony. Considering all the evidence, it would be foolish to attempt to counter it. But allow me to shamelessly grab the ultra-low hanging fruit. Just what the heck is wrong with being a one trick pony?\n\nWe're not talking about Polaroid here.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nBy investing in GOOG stock, you are taking ownership in not only a massive company, but a cultural phenomenon.\n\nConsider that among the most popular search engines on the internet, Google beats out second-best competitor Bing by a margin of 300%! Startlingly, the gap between first and fifth place is nearly 1,200%. Against the bottom run of the top ten, the gap is nearly 12,000%.\n\nIn other words, if you think that Google will ever be upended by anyone else, think again. No other investment besides GOOG stock has such dominance over their industries that people refer to it by the company name. We Google things on the web. And until the day I hear \"I'll iPhone you,\" people can rest assured in their GOOG position.\n\nPut in the simplest of terms, unless there are Russian ICBMs raining down on us, I would never short GOOG stock. The only caveat would be to point out instances of potential technical weakness. Even then, the volatility would likely be on a short-term basis. As I stated above, Alphabet Inc has too much of a powerful brand to ever fail.\n\nAs of this writing, Josh Enomoto was long SNE.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Why Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Stock Is Unstoppable Despite Any Pitfalls appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google recently acquired most of Twitter 's(NYSE: TWTR ) developer products for an undisclosed price. That package includes its mobile application development platform Fabric, the Crashlytics crash-reporting platform, mobile app analytics tool Answers, SMS login system Digits, and development automation system Fastlane.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nDoes the sale indicate that Twitter will sell itself off in bits and pieces instead of as a whole company? Or does it mean that Twitter is merely streamlining its business by dumping its non-core assets? Let's take a closer look at Twitter and Google's plans to decide.\n\nWhy did Twitter sell its developer products?\n\nShares of Twitter currently trade well below its IPO price of $26 due to its stalled out user growth, sluggish revenue growth, and lack of GAAP profitability. Its monthly active users (MAUs) rose just 3% annually to 317 million last quarter as its revenue grew 8% to $616 million -- marking its slowest growth rate since its IPO. Its GAAP net loss only slightly narrowed from $131.7 million a year ago to $102.9 million, mainly due to high stock-based compensation expenses which gobbled up 26% of its revenues.\n\nFaced with these challenges, Twitter announced plans to slash 9% of its workforce and wind down non-core businesses like Vine and Fabric, while focusing more on its core \"Bluebird\" Twitter app. It shuttered Vine last year, but Fabric reportedly attracted the attention of several bidders, including Microsoft and Google. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey claimed that the cuts could drive the company \"toward GAAP profitability in 2017.\"\n\nBy abandoning its developer tools, Twitter can no longer establish an app ecosystem tethered to its social network and back end services. But the retreat isn't surprising, since Facebook abandoned its comparable back end as a service (BaaS) platform, Parse, last year. That failure was attributed to the fact that Parse couldn't compete against similar app development platforms from Google, Microsoft, and Amazon 's AWS. If Facebook couldn't compete, it's doubtful that Twitter could have fared much better. Investors should also have seen the writing on the wall when Twitter canceled its annual Flight developer conference last year.\n\nWhy did Google buy Twitter's tools?\n\nGoogle might seem like an 800-pound gorilla in internet-related services, but its cloud infrastructure platform -- which provides development tools, analytics, and computing power for developers and companies -- is much smaller than Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure. BaaS platforms play a key role in that battle, since they provide cloud-based apps with computing power while letting developers manage those apps, view usage data, and add push notifications and other features.\n\nTo compete more effectively against Amazon and Microsoft, Google acquired Firebase, a BaaS start-up, in 2014. Firebase's developer base quadrupled since that acquisition to about 450,000 users by mid-2016, and Google added additional analytics capabilities and mobile development tools. Google plans to integrate Fabric directly into Firebase, while the other tools should be gradually integrated into the platform.\n\nGoogle's decision to buy Twitter's development tools instead of the whole company also indicates that the social network still isn't desirable as a single purchase. That's likely because potential suitors can't figure out how to address Twitter's slowing MAU and revenue growth and weak profitability. They also probably don't want to inherit Twitter's ongoing problems with bullies, trolls, illicit posts, and fake accounts.\n\nIs the data licensing business next to go?\n\nTwitter's eagerness to sell its non-core businesses raises interesting questions about its Data Licensing business, which sells \"firehose\" feeds of data to various companies. Its revenue rose 26% annually to $71 million, making it Twitter's fastest growing business unit.\n\nBut it's also been blamed for spreading fake news and causing stock market \"flash crashes\" by rapidly sending bot-generated tweets to news organizations and high-speed trading firms. I previously speculated that Twitter was unwilling to purge its network of bots because they counted as MAUs and they fed the licensing unit's firehose feeds. If Twitter sells or spins off its data licensing business, it would generate some fresh cash and let it purge some bots and fake accounts to improve the quality of its social network.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nTwitter's sale of its developer tools to Google isn't a game changer for either company. But it reveals how aggressively Twitter is streamlining its business around its Bluebird app, and indicates that Google might need more acquisitions to keep up with Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud platform race. Therefore, investors should see if Twitter unloads any more non-core businesses in the near future.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Twitter\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) CEO Jeff Bewkes famously compared the streamer to \"the Albanian army\" in 2010 when asked if it posed a challenge to HBO. Wall Street analysts have regularly bashed the stock. Some have since admitted they were wrong, while others continue to throw shade at the company even after its blockbuster earnings report last night. Let's take a look at a few of the biggest myths that have circulated about Netflix in recent years and how the company just disproved them.\n\nImage source: Netflix.\n\nMyth No. 1. Netflix will never be profitable\n\nEven the bears have given Netflix credit for its steady subscriber growth over the years, but the company is spreading itself too thin, spending money it doesn't have to bring in new subscribers. It's a flawed business model, and one that will never be profitable.\n\nReality: Indeed, Netflix has generated minimal profits since it split its streaming service from the DVD-by-mail side as the company has focused on growth before profits, Silicon Valley's mantra. But CEO Reed Hastings promised a year ago, after the company completed its international expansion, that it would generate material profits starting this year, and the company's guidance for the first quarter makes it clear that it will. Netflix is eyeing an operating margin of 9.1% in Q1, and sees domestic contribution margin, hitting 41.3%, better than the 40% goal Netflix had previously announced for 2020. It also expects to report a positive contribution margin in the international segment for the first time ever.\n\nFor the full year, management expects operating margin to moderate at 7%, but that is still up significantly from the 4% clip where it's been in recent years. Hastings also said the company incrementally increase its operating margin from there as it continues to invest in its business. That means Netflix should generate close to $1 billion in operating income and nearly $500 million in net income. In other words, it's undeniably profitable.\n\nMyth No. 2: The international market is a boondoggle\n\nNetflix has clearly demonstrated it can generate a profit at home, but the international market is different, detractors have argued. Accepting payment is more difficult as many people don't have international credit cards; understanding local tastes presents challenges; and Netflix is facing entrenched local competition each market.\n\nReality: If anything, Netflix's international growth has been remarkable. In less than seven years, the company has gained nearly 50 million paying subscribers, and added nearly 15 million last year, the first year that its service was available around the globe. Though it's racked up losses abroad, the international division is about to turn profitable as the company projected a slight contribution profit outside the U.S. this year.\n\nNetflix also seems to be quickly mastering the international programming game as well. Its success in Brazil, which has become its second-biggest market, stands out as the company overcame initial skepticism and payment problems to become a force in Latin America's biggest country. Its sci-fi thriller 3% , released in November, was in Portuguese and set in Sao Paolo, proved to be a hit an even garnered millions of viewers in the US.\n\nOther efforts to localize markets are paying off as well, meaning international subscriber growth should continue to be strong.\n\nMyth No. 3: The competition will catch up\n\nFor years, the bears have been claiming that Netflix's early advantage will eventually fade as the market become saturated as big media companies and start-ups alike dive in.\n\nReality: Netflix is still essentially synonymous with video streaming. It will top 100 million subscribers later this year. Netflix & Chill-a euphemism for a hook-up-has become one of the most popular catchphrases among the millennial generation. The streaming service has permeated the culture in a way that none of its rivals have, and it's not for lack of trying.\n\nDisney , Fox , and NBC formed Hulu in 2007 as an outlet to stream their TV shows, but only has about 12 million subscribers today. Tech giant Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) efforts to gain traction for its paid streaming service, YouTubeRed, have fallen flat. HBO, despite the launch of HBO Now, remains dependent on the traditional Pay-TV ecosystem. Only Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) has followed successfully in Netflix's footsteps with its own slate of award-winning programs, but Amazon has a much different model than Netflix. It's using video as a free giveaway to entice consumers to join its Prime service so they buy more stuff on its website. Amazon Video's viability as a stand-alone service remains questionable. The company recently launched stand-alone video globally, undercutting Netflix on price, but the move has clearly not put a dent in Netflix's own growth rate as last quarter's international subscriber growth set a new record.\n\nNetflix has turned video entertainment into an arms race, and it has the biggest arsenal. Netflix and Amazon were the biggest spenders at the Sundance Film Festival last year, and that should be the case again as both companies have increased their content budgets. Netflix will spend $6 billion on content this year, up from $5 billion last year. Only sports giant ESPN spends more.\n\nIn the last few months alone, Netflix has formed a virtual stand-up-comedy Hall of Fame by signing Jerry Seinfeld, Amy Schumer, Chris Rock, and Dave Chappelle. The company's product is only going to get better as its momentum builds, and there's plenty of room for other streaming services as Netflix and Amazon have shown in the U.S.\n\nWith its high valuation, the stock may continue to be volatile, but the debate over the company's prospects is over. Netflix won.\n\nIt's become a substantially profitable, global media powerhouse with nearly 100 million paying subscribers, and it will continue to dominate the industry for years to come.\n\nFind out why Netflix is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\n\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Twitter offered a suite of mobile developer offerings through Fabric, but as the company now focuses on its core product for long term growth, it is looking to sell its none-core assets and build a leaner structure. Twitter is struggling to grow users and increase user engagement. A renewed focus on its core business this year (after several talks of a possible takeover last year) is critical for the company's revival. Recently, the company allowed live streaming directly through its app by incorporating Periscope into the Twitter app. This was followed by replacing the Vine app with a pared-down version which will let users capture six second videos which can be shared directly on Twitter. We believe Twitter is looking to strengthen its core business and provide all features with its own app to attract users. While the company continues to remain committed to developers and has stated that it will continue to invest in its public APIs and publisher platform, focus on its core business is essential for long term growth of the company.\n\nSee our complete analysis for Twitter\n\nLeaner Structure, Focus On Core Business\n\nLast year, Twitter saw plenty of interest from various players for a possible takeover. While no transaction eventually happened, Twitter now appears to be selling its non-core assets to build a leaner structure. This will ensure that the company can focus its resources on making its core product more exciting to attract users and increase user engagement. Our price estimate for Twitter is nearly 30% higher than its current market price and we expect its U.S. average monthly active users to increase from around 69 million in 2017 to nearly 83 million by the end of our forecast period.\n\nIf this growth is not achieved and the monthly active users stagnate at around 67 million (2016 number), there can be a nearly 10% downside to our price estimate.\n\nWe expect Twitter's international monthly active users to increase from 264 million in 2017 to nearly 334 million by the end of our forecast period.\n\nThere can be a 5% downside to our price estimate if this number stagnates at around 260 million over our forecast period.\n\nTwitter is facing a challenging environment and innovative changes to its core product are critical to draw and retain users. We believe the strategy to move towards a leaner structure by selling non-core assets and focusing on developing the key product can help the company drive revenues in the long term.\n\nView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):\n\nGlobal Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap\n\nMore Trefis Research", "Looking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at ETF Channel , one standout is the iShares MSCI ACWI ETF (Symbol: ACWI) where we have detected an approximate $217.2 million dollar inflow -- that's a 3.7% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 97,000,000 to 100,600,000).

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.\n\nClick here to find out which 9 other ETFs had notable inflows »", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe last few trades I shared on Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) were successful. This includes a win in November after I explained how to collect free dividends on GOOGL stock as we collected over 15% in yield on money risked.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge Alphabet's fundamentals have not changed. I still like it for the long-term. Management continues to execute very well on the cash cow businesses. Better still: Spending on the fringe projects seems to be under control for now.\n\nTechnically, GOOGL stock was tested in late 2016 but has since recovered. Traders sold Alphabet stock and others mega-tech companies like Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) to roll into the Trump trade. Since then, the selling abated and the trade unwound.\n\nNow, mega-tech companies are going into earnings with the winds in their sails. That includes Alphabet, which reports on Thursday, Jan. 26, after the bell.\n\nHow to Trade GOOGL Stock Now\n\nThe Trade: Buy the GOOGL Feb $835/$837.50 debit call spread for $1.20 per contract to open. This is my maximum potential risk. I stand to double my money if GOOGL stock rallies past my spread in the next few weeks.\n\nPremiums are usually elevated ahead of earnings, and sometimes we see a move ahead of the report. If so, then I could close the spread and book partial profits early.\n\nUsually I like to balance my trades by doing the opposite. But this time, since we are going into earnings, I will not sell any bearish risk into GOOGL earnings. Another hedge idea would be to short the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQ ). But today, I will do neither. Instead, I will simply go long Alphabet Inc options as a lottery ticket betting on a positive reaction to their earnings.\n\nI could further juice this trade by adding a credit put spread to collect premium and offset my out of pocket expense. However, this adds more downside risk. Personally, I prefer to wait until after the earnings report before I sell premium into GOOGL.\n\nStill, if you'd like …\n\nThe Juice (Optional): Sell the GOOGL Mar $750/$745 credit put spread for 65 cents per contract. This trade would yield 13% if GOOGL stays above my sold spread while I am holding. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success with a 10% price buffer.\n\nEarnings events add a short-term wild card to credit spreads; the short-term adverse reactions are often short-lived.\n\nI am not required to hold any option trade open through expiration. I can close any of them at any time for partial gains or losses.\n\nNicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com .

Image source: Google.\n\nStop me if you've heard this one before: Major tech giant designs and launches new flagship phone but is unable to fulfill demand due to severe supply constraints and inventory shortages.\n\nThat may often be the case for a certain Cupertino company, but this time around we're talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google. The company's new Pixel phones, which are the first that were completely designed in-house, continue to suffer from inventory shortages. Prospective customers are having an incredibly difficult time actually getting their hands on the device, and it's not just a function of limited distribution since Google only has one exclusive carrier partner, Verizon (NYSE: VZ) .\n\nSurvey says\n\nWave7 Research released some estimates just a few days ago (via FierceWireless ), after conducting surveys at roughly 50 carrier retail stores. The researcher's data shows that the Pixel represented nearly 10% of all smartphone sales at Verizon in December. That's up from the 8% that the Pixel grabbed in November that Wave7 estimated in a separate report.\n\nWhile Verizon remains the exclusive carrier partner that is authorized to sell and distribute the Pixel, it's still faring well at other carriers in terms of activations. Customers have to buy the device somewhere else, but can bring the device to other networks. We already know that T-Mobile is setting up Pixel displays at its retail locations, even if the Un-carrier isn't able to sell the device until Verizon's exclusivity runs its course.\n\nAs far as problems go, it could be worse\n\nThe Verge also notes that according to third-party online inventory trackers, some models have been out of stock at Google's online store since Nov. 30, which was nearly two months ago. The shortages appear to be concentrated on both the larger XL models, as well as those with 128 GB of storage -- that is, the most expensive variants. A Google spokesperson told The Verge:\n\nWe're aware about the inventory issues on the Google Store and Verizon. Honestly, demand has exceeded our expectations. We're doing our best to restock on an ongoing basis.\n\nOf course, in the grand scheme of problems to have, demand vastly outstripping supply is as good as it gets. But it is a problem though, especially since most Android users aren't especially loyal to specific brands. The big risk is that a prospective Pixel buyer is unwilling to endure the wait and simply goes with another flagship Android device, of which there are many solid contenders.\n\nThe shortages are a bit peculiar since Google tapped HTC to effectively serve as a contract manufacturer. While HTC has fallen far in the global smartphone market in terms of unit volumes and prominence, the Taiwanese company still has considerable experience shipping high volumes of handsets. Both Google and HTC likely underestimated demand and may need to shift production capacity away from other devices and make more Pixels.\n\nHow much of an impact Pixel will have on Google's financials remains unclear, as the company has never disclosed granular unit volumes for hardware products, including Nexus devices. For better or for worse, the situation reinforces why I don't believe Google intends to make Pixel a high-volume product .\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

( TWTR ) that runs a tool for developers to make mobile apps. The companies did not disclose any financial details including price.\n\nTwitter launched the unit, called Fabric, in 2014 and it is now used by more than 580,000 mobile developers. The Fabric team is moving to Google, though Twitter declined to say how many employees that included.\n\nGoogle said that it would fold Fabric and its employees into Google'sDeveloper Product Group and that they would work with its Firebase team, which also makes a mobile-app tool for developers.\n\nhttp://www.rttnews.com\n\nThis article appears in: News Headlines", "Earning season is here, and some of the biggest names in tech are set to release their financial results for the fourth calendar quarter of 2016 in the coming days. Of the tech stocks with earnings reports around the corner, IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) will be some of the most high-profile reports to watch. Here's a brief overview of what to look for when each company reports results.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAll eyes on strategic imperatives\n\nInternational Business Machines is the first of these two companies scheduled to report quarterly results. IBM will report results after market close this Thursday and will host a conference call to discuss results at 5:00 PM ET.\n\nIBM investors have recently turned their focus toward IBM's more nascent strategic imperatives, or the company's cloud, analytics, mobility, and security offerings. Growing to 40% of total revenue one year earlier than the company was targeting, IBM's strategic imperatives are growing faster than the rest of its business. While total third-quarter revenue was flat year over year, strategic imperatives revenue was up a nice 16%.\n\nFor investors to remain optimistic about IBM's strategic imperatives, look for this segment's growth to match or exceed the 16% growth achieved in Q4.\n\nOn average, analysts expect IBM to report total fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $21.7 billion and $4.89, respectively. In IBM's fourth quarter of 2015 the company reported revenue and EPS of $22.1 billion and $4.84, respectively.\n\nCan steep revenue growth persist?\n\nFor Alphabet, which reports its fourth-quarter results exactly one week after IBM, revenue growth will be key. Alphabet's core Google advertising business has been firing on all cylinders, helping total revenue and EPS exceed expectations in the company's most recent quarter. The company reported 20% and 23% year-over-year growth in revenue and EPS in Q3, respectively, as aggregate paid clicks, or the total number of clicks advertisers pay Google for, soared 9% sequentially and 33% year over year.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nWhile Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat has warned that tougher year-over-year comparisons will make similar growth in Q4 unlikely, analysts are still modeling for a sharp hike in the company's top line. On average, analysts expect Alphabet's revenue to increase 18% year over year. Can the company's ad revenue continue strongly enough to help the company achieve such a strong increase in total revenue, even when the company is up against a tough year-ago comparison?\n\nThe consensus analyst estimate for Alphabet's fourth-quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS is $25.1 billion and $9.66, respectively. These estimates imply 18% and 11% year-over-year growth in revenue and non-GAAP EPS, respectively.\n\nAfter Alphabet reports its fourth-quarter results on Thursday, Jan. 26, the company will host a live conference call to discuss the results at 4:30 PM ET.\n\nInvestors can stay up-to-date on how these companies performed by checking in on their quarterly earnings releases, listening to their quarterly conference calls, and by staying tuned at The Motley Fool for some post-earnings analysis.\n\n10 stocks we like better than IBM\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) had a respectable performance for the past year, gaining some 16%. Although, it did lag behind one of its fiercest rivals, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), whose stock logged a return of 34%. And both paled in comparison with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), which mustered 40% gains for its shareholders.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOf course, for Alphabet Inc, the company will not have the same kind of high-growth rates of past. The revenue base is simply too massive.\n\nThis does not mean the stock will somehow get stuck, however. If anything, there are some positive long-term drivers that should benefit shareholders in the coming year and beyond. Let's take a look at three:\n\nGOOGL Stock Driver #1 - Tech Megatrends\n\nWhile the online advertising industry has been around for over two decades, there remains lots of room for growth. According to IDC, the global spending is forecast to go from $177.3 billion in 2015 to $315.7 billion in 2020 . Some of the key drivers include: the ubiquity of internet access and smartphones, the advantages of tracking/analytics, personalization, and the increased use of video.\n\nAll this is certainly good news for holders of GOOGL stock. Consider that the company derives about 90% of its revenues from online advertising. More importantly, Alphabet has a tremendous platform, which includes seven properties that have over a billion users (the main Google property, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Chrome, Android and Play).\n\nThe result is that the company is getting an outsized share of the online ad opportunity. In the latest quarter, GOOGL reported a 20% increase in revenues to $22.45 billion. Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, said: \"Our services are prime time for the mobile world.\" After all, Alphabet Inc controls a whopping 95% of the mobile search market.\n\nGOOGL Stock Driver #2 - Bold Innovation\n\nFrom inception, the DNA of GOOGL has been about pushing the envelope on innovation. Granted, sometimes there have been embarrassing flops. But hey, this is critical for achieving success (keep in mind the countless times Thomas Edison failed until he figured out the light bulb).\n\nSo yes, the company has continued to release innovative products. Some of the recent ones include the Pixel phone, Duo (a video chat app), Google Home (a voice-activated speaker) and Allo (a smart messaging app).\n\nBut perhaps the technology that has the most potential to be transformative for GOOGL stock is artificial intelligence. The company's long history of building and leveraging massive databases is definitely a huge advantage (the knowledge base consist of over 70 billion facts about people, places and things).\n\nBasically, with AI, the opportunity is to make technology natural and seamless - not something you need to activate, enter information into or boot up. In other words, the systems will crunch data to learn and adapt.\n\nOh, and the monetization could be enormous. As InvestorPlace.com's Aaron Levitt recently wrote :\n\n\"In the end, Alphabet is setting itself up to be the absolute king of data collection. Moving beyond the desktop and mobile phone and into our daily lives is the next step in how it will better compete and drive advertising sales. This shift is the next evolution in its business model.\"\n\nGOOGL Stock Driver #3 - Financials and Valuation\n\nAlphabet Inc is a cash machine.\n\nIn the latest quarter, operating cash flows came to a hefty $9.8 billion. In all, there is $83.1 billion in the bank - of which $50 billion is overseas. Basically, if Donald Trump enacts policies on repatriation, Alphabet Inc will be in a position to bring home these foreign balances, which can be used for R&D, acquisitions and buybacks.\n\nBut, with the forward price-earnings multiple just under 20, the valuation on GOOGL stock is also reasonable. To put this into perspective, the S&P 500 is at about 19 times forward earnings. Yet, many of the mega caps in the index do not have the potential long-term growth rates of Alphabet stock.\n\nTom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog IPO Playbook and is a registered investment adviser representative (you can visit his site to learn more about his financial planning services).

The objective of the game is to surround empty spaces or your opponent's pieces (called stones) with your own, and remove surrounded pieces from the board. The complexity arises from the 19 by 19 grid containing 361 squares. The number of possible moves in a game exceeds the number of atoms in the universe.\n\nGoogle's AlphaGo clandestinely defeats some of the top Go players in the world. Image source: Pixabay .\n\nIn an online community known for attracting world class Go players, a previously unknown and enigmatic opponent going by the moniker \"Master\" emerged. Master played and won more than 50 consecutive games against some of the top players in the world. Among those players was Ke Jie, described as a 19-year-old prodigy, currently the top ranked Go player in the world. The unusual style of play led some to speculate that the Master might not be human. Those suspicions were confirmed in a tweet by Demis Hassabis, the CEO of DeepMind, a division of Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google. The mysterious Master was AlphaGo, DeepMind's artificial intelligence-based (AI) system.\n\nWould you like to play a game?\n\nDeep Blue -- the chess-playing computer. Image source: Flickr user Gabriel Saldana .\n\nComputers have been defeating their human counterparts for some time. In 1997, Garry Kasparov was defeated by IBM supercomputer Deep Blue in a chess match. This was the first time that artificial intelligence had defeated a reigning world champion. Likewise in 2007, scientists created a computer program called Chinook that cannot be beat at checkers. It evaluates every possible move and even if its human opponent plays flawlessly, the best they can hope to achieve is a draw. So how is this different? In earlier victories, the computer program \"memorized\" every potential move and mathematically calculated the odds of success for each. By using the \"brute force\" technique, the computer was able to quickly determine the outcome of every potential move and choosing the one that leads to success. Deep Blue processed 200 million board positions per second in determining its next move. On the other hand, AlphaGo contains a neural network that mimic's the human brain's capacity to learn. These software models and complex algorithms allow the system to \"learn\" from its past mistakes and use what it has learned going forward. AlphaGo made headlines last year by beating the second-ranked player in the world at Go, a feat many thought impossible.\n\nLife is short, play more\n\nGames are the most effective ways for scientists to develop and test their systems. By gauging the system's ability to conquer game tasks, they are able to more accurately assess how successful a system will be at providing solutions for real-world challenges. Artificial intelligence systems have been playing and winning increasingly complex games that enable real-world applications. Learning to play the game Civilization enabled a computer to better understand language by having the system digest the manual and apply the rules to playing the game. This led to advances in natural language processing.\n\nDeepMind's AI-based Deep-Q Network was loaded with 49 Atari games and not given instructions on how to play.\n\nDeep-Q learned to play Atari games. Image source: Pixabay .\n\nBy providing the input of the video pixels of the game including the score and allowing the system to experiment with random keystrokes, the system learned to play and win 29 of the 49 games, without ever being given the rules or the objective. DeepMind believes this will eventually lead to general learning systems, machines that can think -- the holy grail of AI.\n\nA team from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and TU Darmstadt used Grand Theft Auto to improve their systems' visual learning algorithms by automating the process of identifying images used to train the system. The results were astounding as the automation was 1,000 times faster. The team believes that its success will lead to additional breakthroughs in computer vision tasks.\n\nTeams at Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Research Lab created an AI training platform on the game Minecraft that allows its system to learn from and collaborate with human players, perform a range of simple to complex tasks, and understand complicated environments. They anticipate that this will accelerate deep learning by teaching the systems to understand and navigate three-dimensional spaces.\n\nThe Foolish final word\n\nGames provide researchers with an effective tool for training and evaluating their AI systems. As the complexity of the games they conquer increases, so does their ability to solve real-world problems.\n\nKatja Hofmann of the Microsoft Research Lab had this to say: \"I think what's underappreciated is the power of these platforms to really increase the speed of innovation, to allow us to very rapidly make progress in the underlying learning technology, and the fact that this will translate into better algorithms for real-world applications.\"\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While some have speculated CBS (CBS) might be a natural buyer, perhaps the most obvious one of all isn't an old-world media conglomerate, but rather a new one -- YouTube.\n\nThe Google-owned (GOOG) video-sharing website and not CBS, Paramount, Fox or any other major conglomerate would make the most sense for Sony Pictures, should the Japanese-based conglomerate want to offload the unit.\n\nUnlike the aforementioned companies, YouTube (via its parent company, Alphabet), has the balance sheet to do such a deal. At the end of the third-quarter, Alphabet had more than $83 billion in cash and cash equivalents, plenty enough to swallow a deal for Sony Pictures, which could go for as much as $20 or $30 billion, depending upon the math.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter has mentioned CBS (as have others) as a potential buyer of Sony Pictures and it makes sense. Les Moonves has long wanted to own a movie studio and it's the only major U.S.-based media conglomerate without a significant movie studio (CBS Films is small in comparison to Warner Bros., Universal, 20th Century Fox, Walt Disney [DIS] and Paramount).\n\nHowever, Moonves lacks the balance sheet that Google/YouTube has, despite having the same ambitions.\n\nLike CBS and its CBS All-Access over-the-top service (which has more than 1 million subscribers), YouTube has its own streaming service, YouTube Red. By owning Sony Pictures, Google/YouTube could create exclusive, must-see content for YouTube Red.\n\nSony Pictures has the license for a great number of Marvel characters (Spider-Man and his whole universe, as well as several others), all of whom could be given television shows of their own. It would also potentially be the home to James Bond for a continued number of years, with the franchise's home in doubt, as the most recent movie, Spectre, was the last one under the existing contract at Sony.\n\nFor those concerned it would potentially harm competition, there's no reason Sony would not continue to honor existing contracts that the studio has with services like Netflix (NFLX), Hulu, Amazon (AMZN) and others. It would lose much needed revenue and relationships, especially at a time when both are becoming harder to come by and maintain.\n\nPress reports had mentioned that Viacom ex-CEO Phillippe Dauman had wanted to sell a stake in its movie studio, Viacom, valuing the studio as much as $10 billion (which ironically, was the price it acquired Paramount for more than 20 years ago).\n\nGiven that Sony Pictures generated around $8 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016 (far more than Paramount), it's a good bet that it could be valued significantly higher than the $10 billion valuation of Paramount, leaving a potential buyer to a select few.\n\nYouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki has talked about making original content, but not at the rate that Netflix or Amazon have done, due to its service being ad supported. However, owning Sony Pictures and putting TV shows on YouTube Red could help give the service a boost, given its reliance on subscriptions for revenues, not advertising.\n\nShould Sony ever decide to put Sony Pictures on the block, YouTube would be crazy not to take a look at it, especially considering the importance content will have going forward in deciding which streaming service captures mind-share, as well as market share. And at a price tag of $20 billion, there are few companies that could swallow that pill. Google, however, is one.", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ) is doing all it can to make sure that it is dominant in the 21st Century as it was throughout the 20th.\n\nSource: Mike Mozart via Flickr\n\nIts recent megadeal to buy satellite television provider DirecTV for $49 billion was just the beginning of its strategy to build a strong vertical presence across content channels. It has since bundled DirecTV services with T stock's mobile platform and offers data-free viewing for AT&T subscribers.\n\nWhile other content providers are not happy with this deal and have taken their case to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the new change in leadership in D.C. may well see an FCC that less concerned with net neutrality and more concerned with business interests.\n\nTWX and T Stock\n\nThe other big front that T is working on is the purchase of Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX ) for a whopping $85 billion. The Barack Obama administration, and even President-elect Donald Trump have raised concerns about the deal. But the CEO and a senior AT&T VP were seen Thursday morning at Trump Tower in New York for a 9:30 a.m. meeting with the future president.\n\nThere's little doubt what that discussion was about. Now we will see if T stock made any headway.\n\nBut getting into AT&T is a good idea, because approval of the TWX deal isn't factored into the stock right now, and it's likely if the deal doesn't go through in its entirety, there will be the possibility of revising the deal to make both T and the government happy.\n\nT was up 20% in the past 12 months but has just gotten back near its 52-week highs in recent weeks. After a solid run into the summer, the stock cooled in Q4. This is an encouraging sign. The profit takers are already out and the stock is moving on its merits moving forward.\n\nBeyond the two megadeals (one pending), T stock is also not resting on its laurels in the mobile space. It's using its DirecTV bundle to attract cord cutters, who can stream over 100 channels of premium content for $60 a month. T is also launching a 5G test of its streaming services in Austin, Texas in the coming year.\n\n5G is 10-100 times faster than 4G streaming. This is a bold move into cutting-edge technology and this is the value of having a content partner like DirecTV. T can now offer content at much higher speeds than its competitors, which will be a big value for cord cutters and mobile gamers. T is so much more than a telecom at this point, and if the TWX deal goes through, the increased ad sales alone will be enormous.\n\nOn the other side of all this growth is the fact that T is one of the Dividend Aristocrats. That means it has raised its dividend every year for more than 25 years. In its case 32 years and counting. What's more, T throws off a very attractive 4.8% dividend.\n\nThe bottom line is, there are plenty of reasons to be bullish on T stock, even during this time of transition.\n\nLouis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

(T) Stock for Its Growth, Not Just Its Dividend appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "E-commerce giants Amazon ( AMZN ) and Alibaba ( BABA ) have both reported massive growth in their cloud computing businesses over the past few years. Alibaba Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have outpaced the growth in total worldwide spending on cloud computing and infrastructure services. Alibaba has grown at a faster pace than Amazon, primarily due to the fact that it predominantly operates in China, which is a relatively nascent and fast-growing market. In terms of scale, Alibaba's cloud computing revenues are much lower than Amazon's AWS revenues, as shown below.\n\nStrong Revenue Growth For Amazon & Alibaba\n\nBoth Amazon and Alibaba have continued to witness strong growth rates in terms of revenue as well as profit margins in 2016. Amazon reported operating profit margin of 26.2% for its AWS division for Q2'16 and Q3'16 combined, which was almost 8 percentage points higher than the prior year period. Similarly, Alibaba also witnessed a drastic improvement in operating margin in the same period. Although the margin for Alibaba Cloud is still negative, it has shown quarter over quarter improvement through the year. It is likely that Alibaba Cloud could become profitable for the company over the next couple of years.\n\nIt should be noted that we have used only June and September quarter figures for comparison since Alibaba just started reporting segment-wise margins in the June quarter last year.\n\nRole of Cloud Business In Driving Company Growth\n\nWhile both companies are enjoying strong revenue growth in their cloud businesses, there is a huge difference in the contribution of cloud to net profits. Amazon purchases products at wholesale rates and stores the inventory at Amazon Fulfillment Centers and sells them as Amazon Verified Products. This helps in weeding out fake and counterfeit products from its listings - something that Alibaba has reportedly struggled with over the last few quarters. Therefore, Alibaba's operating profit margin is significantly higher than Amazon's, since it does not maintain inventory and primarily acts as the aggregator between buyers and sellers. As a result, Amazon's e-commerce business contributes 92% of net revenues but only a third of the company-wide operating profits. Comparatively, Alibaba's e-commerce segments combined generate 84% of net revenues and a whopping 169% of operating income.\n\nAWS is effectively helping Amazon expand its e-commerce business in international markets where it is operating at a loss . On the other hand, Alibaba is financing its cloud business and other new ventures such as digital media, entertainment and online video through the profits generated by its core commerce segments.\n\nRobust Long-Term Outlook For Cloud\n\nAccording to an estimate by Market Research Media, the global cloud computing market is likely to continue to grow at 30% through 2020 to become a $270 billion market similar pace over the next few years. Moreover, the cloud computing market in China could grow at a CAGR of about 45% over the next few years, according to an estimate by Bain & Company. We forecast AWS revenues to grow at almost 30% over the next few years, while Alibaba Cloud revenues could grow at 40% in the same period.\n\nSee our full analysis for Alibaba|Amazon .\n\nView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):\n\nGlobal Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap\n\nMore Trefis Research", "InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is the parent company of Google, the undisputed leader of online search and digital advertising. Its dominance hasn't gone unnoticed by investors, who have bid the shares up towards their all-time highs.\n\nSource: Brionv via Wikimedia (Modified)\n\nYet Google is no moonshot, which is the term it has used to describe the venture capital activities in its \"Other Bets\" segment. This includes self-driving cars and its Nest franchise, which actually has some sales and helps consumers more efficiently heat and cool their homes.\n\nThe question for investors going forward is if Alphabet can continue to dominate online advertising. It and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) controlled 50% of the $60 billion online ad market in 2015. Google controlled half of the market, or $30 billion. Facebook's take was $8 billion, but is also growing rapidly.\n\nGOOG Stock Isn't Stopping\n\nAlphabet's sales growth has been meteoric. It is projected to report sales of nearly $90 billion for all of 2016 (the final year results have yet to be fully reported) and that should jump to above $100 billion this year (calendar 2017). That will mark a roughly 10-fold increase from the $10.6 billion it reported in 2006.\n\nExtrapolating those figures out another decade, Alphabet stands a chance at generating over $1 trillion in revenue. That is certainly a tall order, but the network effect (where a product or service grows more valuable as more people use it) is proving to be one of the greatest growth drivers capitalism has ever seen.\n\nOf course, there is a downside to such dominance. The European Union has been attacking Google, alleging it is abusing its dominant position to block out competition and keep internet surfers dependent on its services. Specifically, it has suggested that Google pushes hard to make its search engine the default on smart phones and computers. It's not always easy being on top.\n\nThe worries over Google's dominance echo the control Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) held over personal computers back in the 1990s. In similar fashion, the U.S. Justice Department accused Microsoft of using its personal computing software dominance to push its Internet Explorer internet browser, which helped end the Netscape browser era that helped pioneer online search and browsing the world wide web.\n\nGoogle's dominance won't last forever, but there is little reason to see it going away any time soon. In the next two years, analysts see earnings growing at a mid-teens percentage rate to above $41 per share for all of this year. It is a huge beneficiary of the growth in everything digital as consumers increasingly shop and socialize online.\n\nBased off the current stock price of $803 per share, the forward price-to-earnings multiple of GOOG stock is below 20, or right about the market multiple. That is a very reasonable multiple for one of the best large-cap growth stories in the market today. Facebook is also compelling, but represents a higher growth candidate with higher risk - due mostly to its higher valuation.\n\nI recently detailed that I think Microsoft isn't growing fast enough to justify where the stock is trading at currently. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) represents an interesting story among large technology companies, but is much more tied to its iPhone and related hardware, which is growing more slowly and becoming more of a commodity as competitors copy its revolutionary smart phone product and apps that consumers download.\n\nIn another sign of Google's dominance, it recently was reported that the Google Android operating system was used in nine out of 10 smart phones being sold. Its market share of the smart phone market was pegged at 87.5%, far exceeding Apple's iOS operating system. Consumers are increasingly using their smart phones to access the web.\n\nGoogle has specialized in releasing appealing products and services that help drive use of its search engines and drive advertising revenue. The offerings include Android, Google Maps, Google search, voice recognition on its phones, and a new Pixel phone that has received decent reviews.\n\nBottom Line on GOOG\n\nThere will likely come a time when the market grows concerned with either Google's dominance, or starts to worry about slowing growth. Significant EU fines or allegations could also send the share price off recent highs. But at this point, any dip in the stock price represents a buying opportunity.\n\nThe share price is also a reasonable value given the growth prospects. Cash flow generation is great, and there is a good chance that management starts paying a dividend at some point in the future.\n\nThere is also the potential that a moonshot investment revolutionizes a market. Self-driving cars is certainly a candidate, and Google's initial interest with the technology has helped drive innovation in the space.\n\nAs of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann was long shares of Facebook, but did not hold a position in any of the other aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Alphabet Inc (GOOG) Stock Is No Moonshot appeared first on InvestorPlace ." ], "sentiment_subjectivity" : [ 0.2661947342275212, 0.5560529255690546, 0.3333333333333333, 0.4965257531584061, 0.5343325496342737, 0.4975411659991096, 0.5048430735930737, 0.4292629946885266, 0.3450880990354674, 0.4566581155470045 ], "headline" : [ "Rockefeller Financial Services Inc Buys Facebook Inc, Synchrony Financial, Cemex SAB de CV, ...", "Google Has a Good Problem With Pixel", "Google To Buy Twitter's Fabric", "2 Tech Earnings Reports to Watch", "3 Reasons You Should Buy Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock in 2017", "Games Hold the Key to Teaching Artificial Intelligence Systems", "Sony Pictures Might Be Up For Sale - Could This Be Google's Big Chance?", "Buy AT&T Inc.

The mission is slated to take place sometime in late 2017 -- but now, it turns out, by the time those satellites reach orbit, Alphabet may not even own them anymore.\n\n\n\nPlanet Labs' satellites might not give the most hi-res images, but they still give a nice picture of L.A. and the condition of the reservoirs that water it. Image source: Planet Labs .\n\nSpinning on a dime\n\nAs The Wall Street Journal reports, Alphabet has entered into discussions to sell its entire Terra Bella operation -- the whole kit and kaboodle -- to rival satellite-imaging start-up Planet Labs . This is a surprising reversal, to say the least.\n\nIn fact, Alphabet only just finished buying Terra Bella in 2014, paying $500 million for the business. As part of Alphabet, Terra Bella's seven orbital satellites have helped to improve the quality of Alphabet's self-built Google Maps, decreasing the company's reliance on outside satellite imaging suppliers such as DigitalGlobe (NYSE: DGI) . But Alphabet has apparently rethought the advantages of owning its own photo-snapping satellites and decided it's better to focus on its core business -- and outsource sat-services work to others.\n\nAfter all, as satellite-research firm TMF Associates head Tim Farrar explains, it only costs Alphabet $10 million to $50 million a year to buy all the satellite images it needs from other suppliers. At those prices, the $500 million spent to acquire Terra Bella could keep Google Maps in pictures for anywhere from 10 to 50 years. Factor in the cost of maintaining, operating, and eventually replacing Terra Bella's satellites as they wear out over time, and it becomes even more economical for Alphabet to just buy its pics from outside vendors such as DigitalGlobe and Planet Labs.\n\nIs SpaceX next?\n\nSpeaking of outsiders, you probably recall that two years ago, Alphabet teamed up with Fidelity to invest $1 billion in SpaceX to assist with the latter's effort to build a constellation of broadband internet satellites . This project is a little closer to Alphabet's core internet search business, but it's still something Alphabet can easily outsource to other companies to handle.\n\nIn fact, Alphabet recently announced that it is halting expansion of its Google Fiber rollout and laying off workers in that division. Soon after, the company pulled the plug on a plan to provide internet service via solar drone . The company is still looking into the possibility of using high-altitude balloons to beam internet service to earth, but given the rollbacks elsewhere, it appears Alphabet may lose interest in this effort as well and begin looking around for someone to buy out its stake in SpaceX.\n\n(The good news: If and when such a sale takes place, it would give us an up-to-date look at how the market is valuing SpaceX stock ).\n\nFinal thought: What does all of this mean for investors?\n\nWhy might Alphabet be pulling back from its space investments? In a word: profits. For some time , analysts have been criticizing Alphabet's \"moonshot\" investments for blunting profit margins and causing the company to miss earnings targets. By reducing investments in non-core businesses, Alphabet may hope to get its margins moving upwards again. And Alphabet's moves may have follow-on effects elsewhere.\n\nConsider: Planet Labs already has more than 100 Earth-imaging microsatellites in orbit. Adding seven somewhat larger Terra Bella satellites to the mix won't grow Planet Labs' constellation very much. What it will do is remove a rapidly growing competitor from this industry -- and hand greater pricing power to DigitalGlobe and Planet Labs.\n\nWith less competition, DigitalGlobe should become more profitable. And with less competition, the still-private Planet Labs will become a more attractive investment if and when it decides to IPO.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's because IHS estimates that there will be 76 million partially to fully autonomous vehicles on the road worldwide by 2035.\n\nThat's not as far away as it may seem and this shifting automotive market -- which will be worth $77 billion less than 20 years from now -- leaves plenty of opportunity for long-term investors to benefit.\n\nIf you're looking for top driverless car stocks that are leading the pack, you many want to consider Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) , and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\n\nNew name, same self-driving leadership\n\nAlphabet's self-driving team was recently spun off into its own company and now goes by the name of Waymo. To date, Waymo has logged nearly 2 million miles of self-driving on the road and 1 billion miles of simulated driving in 2016.\n\nThat makes Waymo a leader in the driverless car space, because one of the most important aspects of letting cars drive themselves is giving them direct experience in handling the myriad of situations they'll encounter in the real world.\n\nAnd Waymo proved recently that it's much more than just an Alphabet side project when it announced that it's developed its own LIDAR technology that is 90% cheaper than the previous system it was using. LIDAR sends out light signals that bounce off objects around it in order to tell self-driving vehicles what things (cars, buildings, pedestrians, etc.) are around it.\n\nThough the new technology is much cheaper, Waymo says it's accurate enough to tell which direction a pedestrian is looking (which is helpful when a driverless car is trying to determine where a person might walk).\n\nWaymo is setting itself up to benefit from the driverless car market by selling its hardware and software as a service. Some of the details are still unknown, but Waymo showed its hand recently when it announced a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to test self-drivng car services starting this year.\n\nWaymo's president and CEO, John Krafcik, said recently that the company will have its next prototypes on public roads some time this year, further solidifying the company in the driverless car space.\n\nDon't forget China\n\nSelf-driving vehicles get a lot of attention in the U.S., but China could end up being one of the biggest users of driverless car tech -- and Baidu might benefit the most.\n\nThe company is often called the Google of China, because it controls everything from countries largest search engine, earns most of its revenues from advertising, and has some of the world's most advanced self-driving technologies as well.\n\nBaidu is already testing its technology in cities across China and plans to release more driverless vehicles on the road next year, with the goal of bringing mass-produced driverless cars to market by 2021. The company benefits from China's relaxed position on self-driving regulations and the country's need to improve transportation its famously large cities.\n\nIt's still unclear how Baidu will make money from its driverless car pursuits, but it wouldn't be surprising to see the company go the same route as Waymo and strike up a partnership with an automaker to launch a self-driving service or sell its technology directly to automakers.\n\nThe carmaker play\n\nInvestors shouldn't make the mistake of overlooking Tesla's driverless car opportunities or the huge strides the company's already taken. Tesla began adding all of the necessary hardware to make all its vehicles fully autonomous just a few months ago, something no other carmaker is even close to doing.\n\nAll of the hardware isn't turned on right now, but it'll use the technology to collect driving data to improve its semi-autonomous software. When enough information has been collected in real-word situations, Tesla will then offer owners the option to activate the hardware .\n\nTesla also recently posted a video of its semi-autonomous Autopilot technology driving a person around town in the fog while navigating intersections, pedestrians, traffic, and even bicyclists. Tesla has already talked about plans to let its owners rent out their vehicles to others when they are not utilizing it, and CEO Elon Musk says the time frame for fully autonomous Teslas could happen by the end of this year.\n\nIn a move that further proves the company's commitment to self-driivng technology, Tesla recently announced that it'll be using technology from another driverless car tech leader, NVIDIA Corporation 's(NASDAQ: NVDA) . Tesla will use NVIDIA's supercomputer in its new cars to help them process all the visual information collected and give the vehicles optimal image recognition capabilities through NVIDIA's GPUs.\n\nThere's no going back now\n\nWhile driverless cars may still seem like a long way off, automakers are continually adding incremental self-driving tech to their vehicles and the U.S. government is providing new opportunities (and much-needed rules) for making these technologies a reality. Investors looking for a new technological shift to bet on should look no further than driverless cars -- and consider any of the companies listed above.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Tesla Motors\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

As return results for 2016 roll in, several prominent funds have reported market-beating gains, but data from Hedge Fund Research Institute on Tuesday confirms that funds categorized as \"value\" beat those focused on \"growth\" on 12-month, three-year and four-year annual bases.\n\nIn the category of equity hedge funds, the HFRX EH: Fundamental Value Index returned 0.85% in December, 3.64% in the past 12 months, 0.42% in the past three years and 4.12% in the past four years. The HFRX EH: Fundamental Growth Index declined 1.12%, 6.55%, 1.88% and 0.4% for the same periods.\n\nThe Fundamental Value Index also exceeded the general HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index in all periods except for December. It returned 0.86% for the month, 2.50% in the past 12 months, lost 0.6% in the past three years and gained 2.46% in the past four years.\n\nA screen shows that the hedge funds tracked by GuruFocus have the greatest consensus on Alphabet ( GOOG ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ) Bank of America ( BAC ), Apple ( AAPL ) and Facebook ( FB ), whose value status would be arguable by different managers. Each of the stocks appreciated by double digits over the past year.\n\nThe gains come against a 20.5% rise in the S&P 500, though, that extended the five-year market rally of 72%.\n\nDespite reports of clients fleeing hedge funds due to lackluster returns, HFR released another study Friday saying that total assets under management in the industry rose above $3 trillion for the first time. Total capital increased by $46.8 billion in the fourth quarter, to $3.02 billion at the end of the year. It was the second consecutive quarter of record assets for hedge funds.\n\nThe industry still faces investor withdrawals, as clients pulled $71.1 billion, or 2.4% of assets, from the industry in 2016, the second largest outflow since 2009, when they took back $131 billion. Client redemptions totaled $18.7 billion in the fourth quarter, or 0.63% of industry assets, compared to an outflow of $28.2 billion in the third quarter, the report said.\n\nIn the largest strategy in the industry, equity hedge, capital ballooned to $7.5 billion in the fourth quarter and $20 billion for the year, for a record of $849 billion. The index tracking the strategy also increased by 5.5% compared to the previous year, driven by energy/basic materials and fundamental value funds.\n\nBut the category also saw the fundamental value portion lead outflows, with $17 billion gone, followed by fundamental growth strategies, which lost $11 billion, as the total declined $6 billion. Investors redirected to other strategies within equity hedge funds, with quantitative directional seeing $4.7 billion and equity market neutral $3.9 billion in inflows.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .", "Alibaba ( BABA ) is scheduled to announce its fiscal Q3 2017 earnings on January 24. The company reported 40-50% growth in revenues in each of the first three quarters of 2016, with significant growth coming from its cloud computing and Digital Media businesses. In the most recent quarter, Digital Media and entertainment, which includes revenues from online video streaming Youku Tudou and mobile Internet services revenue from UCWeb, were up by over 300% to RMB 3.6 billion. This was primarily attributable to the Youku Tudou acquisition, which was completed in the first half of the year. Additionally, cloud computing and other ventures revenues were up by a massive 110% to RMB 2.2 billion.\n\nOn the other hand, Alibaba's core commerce businesses has continued to post strong revenue growth over the last few years. This trend continued through 2016 with over 40% revenue growth in combined core commerce revenue streams. Growth in Alibaba's international e-commerce business was further boosted by the $1 billion acquisition of the Singaporean e-commerce giant Lazada in April last year.\n\nAlibaba's largest division is the online retail business in China, which includes websites Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan. This segment has provided consistent growth for the company over the last few years, with revenues growing from RMB 24 billion in 2012 to RMB 75 billion in 2015. The growth spree has continued in 2016, with revenues growing by 35-40% through the March, June and September quarters.\n\nFor the full year we forecast Alibaba's China retail revenues to grow by 32% to just under RMB 100 billion, driven by a corresponding increase in the total gross merchandise volume (GMV) handled by Alibaba. Alibaba's China domestic GMV could increase by over 25% to RMB 3.7 trillion for the full year. GMV for Alibaba is calculated as the multiplier of total number of buyers (or monthly active users) and the average spend per buyer. Alibaba has witnessed strong growth in monthly active users, especially in lower-tier cities across China due to the growing smartphone and internet penetration in these regions. As a result, the number of buyers is expected to continue to increase over the next few years.\n\nComparatively, we forecast Alibaba's cloud computing and other revenues combined to grow at almost 100% year-over-year to RMB 16.1 billion. As mentioned earlier, much of the growth in Digital Media is attributable to the acquisition of Youku Tudou. Additionally, cloud computing revenues have grown as a result of an increase in the number of paying customers. The total number of paying customers in the June quarter more than doubled over the previous year quarter to 651,000.\n\nWe forecast the company's adjusted EBITDA to grow at 27% through 2016, which is actually a slightly slower rate than its forecast revenue growth. The resulting EBITDA margin could compress by almost 4 percentage points to around 48%. This is mainly due to the fact that Alibaba is currently operating at a loss on all its non-commerce divisions. Alibaba is investing heavily on developing platforms for cloud computing, acquiring traffic for the online video and music segments, and investing in content and production with a longer term view. As a result, Alibaba's operating profit margin has declined on a year-over-year basis in each of the previous two years as the company has acquired new businesses and invested in developing newer platforms. This trend could continue over the next couple of years since the near-term pressure on EBITDA margins is expected to sustain due to increased investments. However, the company has a marketplaces model and has a huge potential to scale up its cloud offerings. This could help the company maintain relatively low variable costs in the long run, which would imply that its operating leverage will remain high in the long run.\n\nSee Our Full Analysis For Alibaba\n\nView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):\n\nGlobal Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap\n\nMore Trefis Research", "Image Source: Getty Images\n\nThough they don't compete head-to-head (for now), social networking dynamo Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and e-commerce leader Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) are two of the most successful companies in tech today. Now, as their market capitalizations each sit near $400 billion, Facebook and Amazon shares have once again shown that their days as growth companies remain far from over.\n\nAMZN data by YCharts\n\nFor all their successes, though, it isn't immediately clear whether Amazon or Facebook is the better buy today. In this article, we will put Amazon and Facebook shares through a 3-part investing gauntlet to determine which company is the more compelling stock.\n\n1. Financial fortitude\n\nThe differences in Amazon and Facebook's business models manifest themselves here. In comparing the two, Facebook simply trounces Amazon in all but one liquidity measurement.\n\nCompany Cash & Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio Amazon $18.3 billion $8.2 billion $14.6 billion 1.0x Facebook $26.1 billion $0 billion $12.5 billion 11.6x\n\nData Source: Amazon investor relations, Facebook investor relations, Yahoo! Finance\n\nLike Alphabet , Facebook's lucrative advertising platform provides it with plenty of excess cash, largely negating the need for the company to take on debt to fund its operations. On the other hand, the fixed asset nature of Amazon's e-commerce business requires the company to employ a responsible amount of leverage in its capital structure. Speaking to their different margin structures, Amazon's revenue base is roughly four-time as large as Facebook's. So though Amazon's financial footing is indeed sound, Facebook easily wins the comparison of financial fortitude.\n\nWinner: Facebook\n\n2. Durable competitive advantages\n\nAs the leaders in their respective markets, it's fair to say that both Facebook and Amazon.com each enjoy durable competitive advantages, albeit of very different sorts. Amazon derives its competitive moat from two distinct sources. First, Amazon's leadership position in e-commerce gives the company meaningful leverage over its suppliers -- remember its heated dispute with book publishers like Hachette? -- which translates into lower prices. Second, Amazon's uniquely entrepreneurial culture -- Jeff Bezos describes it as \"the best place in the world to fail' -- allows it to constantly reinvent and improve its business model. It's this kind of thinking that allowed Amazon to create AWS, and it's this same spirit that could see Amazon disrupt the global logistics business as well. Amazon's uncanny ability to find ways to lower its own cost structure, and thus the prices it charges becomes a self-fulfilling growth driver that Amazon refers to as its Flywheel Effect .\n\nFacebook also enjoys several important competitive advantages. As easily the world's largest social network, Facebook's massive size and scale make it one of the most important companies in tech and one of the most difficult to disrupt. With 1.79 billion monthly active users as of its most recent earnings, Facebook's ability to reach nearly any demographic at scale makes it impossible for marketers to ignore. This network effect also extends to its user base as well; the nature of its network effects mean Facebook's network becomes more valuable as more users join. Lastly, machine learning and artificial intelligence software need massive data sets to power their learning processes, and few companies possess as large an interconnected trove of personal data as Facebook.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\n3. Valuation\n\nFrom a purely numerical standpoint, Facebook easily wins the valuation showdown against Amazon. Here's a quick snapshot of how several of the most popular valuation metrics break down between these two tech giants.\n\nCompany P/E Forward P/E EV/EBITDA Amazon 182.4 89.8 34.5 Facebook 59.6 24.1 25.6\n\nData Source: Amazon investor relations, Facebook investor relations, Yahoo! Finance\n\nAmazon generates far more cash than its accounting income suggests, which explains the chasm-like disparity between the e-commerce giant's earnings and EBITDA multiples. Digging into its cash flow statement, Amazon generated an impressive $14.6 billion in cash from its operations -- nearly half of which is eaten by non-cash depreciation charges alone -- over its past 12 months, versus $2.1 billion in GAAP profits. This reflects the company's longstanding strategy to reinvest its earnings as aggressively as possible to fuel its long-term growth, which it has done by rapidly growing its fulfillment network over the past decade.\n\nThough it uses some long-lived assets like data centers similarly, Facebook's overall business model is far less fixed-asset intensive, which translates into far larger gross margins and higher profit margins for Facebook. As was the case with their balance sheet examinations in this article's first section, the differences in their business models makes comparing the differences in Facebook's and Amazon's valuations an apple-to-oranges exercise. However, at the end of the day, Facebook's greater profits and lower multiples earn it a win in this category.\n\nWinner: Facebook (slightly)\n\nAnd the winner is... Facebook\n\nWinning two of the three categories, Facebook earns the title of better buy here.

The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon.com and Facebook. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .", "Donald Trump (Shutterstock photo)\n\nDonald Trump has been sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. The President-elect, who pledged to “Make America great again,” promised plenty of things he would do regarding his first day in office. From repealing and replacing Obamacare to renegotiating NAFTA and beginning the construction of the wall on the Mexican border.\n\nWe won’t know for certain which of Trump’s policies will take priority or how they will be enforced. But what we do know is that for Trump to make good on his promises to bring back jobs, grow GDP and strengthen industry, he needs businesses to lead, innovate and hire workers. For that to happen, businesses leaders need to know their government is on their side. To that end, here are some names to own for the next four years (at least) as Trump’s policies take shape.\n\nLower Corporate Taxes\n\nTrump’s promise to lower corporate taxes can have a boosting effect on the tech sector, which has an estimated $1.4 trillion stashed in overseas tax havens. These include some America's largest corporations such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which could face a huge tax hit if they bring that cash home. Not only has Trump promised to lower the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, he pledged to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax.\n\nBeyond lowering the tax rate, it would hardly shock anyone if Trump — given his pro-business stance — were to enact a tax holiday at some point during his presidency. Companies like Cisco (CSCO), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) would thrive. They would no longer need to borrow cheap cash to fund their operations. Likewise, a better capitalized Tesla (TSLA) can accelerate the building of its Gigafactory, helping it achieve not only higher profit margins, but also higher vehicle production. In the process, Tesla would ignite the state of Nevada as an innovative hub, while mass-producing producing emission-free vehicles at affordable prices.\n\n“Repeal and Replace”\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, a.k.a Obamacare was designed to — among other things — “insure the un-insurable.” Notably, to provide insurance coverage to people with pre-existing conditions who were blocked under the then-existing rules. Depending on what side of the aisle you’re on, Obamacare either did its job or was a “complete disaster,” according to Trump. Still, whether Obamacare is entirely dismantled or parts of it is kept, you don’t have to look too far beyond UnitedHealth (UNH) to find a stock can will thrive.\n\nUnitedHealth has worked aggressively to exit the Affordable Care exchanges, which reduces its exposure to any changes Trump might make. What’s more, added from being the nation's largest health insurer, UnitedHealth owns Optum, which provides pharmacy benefit management services. Last week, not only did the company beat top- and bottom-line estimates, UnitedHealth raised its fiscal 2017 financial outlook, suggesting it is ready for whatever Trump decides to do.\n\nNot every company will be as lucky. Conversely, companies such HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) that prospered under Obamacare may suffer. As will government health care providers such as Centene Corporation (CNC) and Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH).\n\nScale Back Dodd-Frank\n\nCutting down strict regulations imposed on financial institutions has been another policy Trump has proposed. After all, how can he achieve economic growth and strengthen small business if banks aren't lending money — something banks collectively struggled to do under Dodd-Frank. But as evidenced by the strong earnings results released so far from the likes of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS), financials are once again the sector to bank on.\n\nWritten to strengthen consumer protection and create tougher rules on excessive risk-taking, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act has been cited by bank executives as a prohibiter of growth. \"There's many aspects of it that we've got to kill,\" said Steven Mnuchin, Trump's pick for Treasury secretary. Mnuchin former partner at Goldman Sachs, called Dodd-Frank \"the number one priority on the regulatory side.”\n\nTo that end, I would be surprised if Trump doesn’t take to “repeal and replace” Dodd-Frank in his first 100 days in office. Combined with the prospect of higher interest rates, lower taxes it’s tough to ignore the potential upside a bank like Morgan Stanley (MS) can provide. It’s not just the big banks that will prosper, however. Keep an eye on super regionals like Comerica (CMA), US Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial (PNC), which Trump has made great again.", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nConcerns about so-called \"fake news\" won't derail the real profits social media giant Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) will generate in 2017 and beyond. And this makes FB stock one to bet on before the company's earnings are released later this month. Combined with accelerating ad-revenue growth, the company's $6 billion buyback and its mobile assets, Facebook stock should reach $150 in the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAside from fake news , the emergence and popularity of Snapchat has scared off some FB investors as seen with the near-3% decline Facebook stock suffered at the end of 2016.\n\nStill, with fast-growing assets, such as Instagram and Messenger, which will help drive growth in the quarters ahead, the Menlo Park, California-based company continues to be a dominant force in the realm of advertising.\n\nFacebook Stock Is Still Standing Strong\n\nWhat's more, FB has perfected mobile, which gives it a distinct advantage over Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) and even Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ). For this reason, Facebook is expected reach $30 billion in mobile ad revenue and $38 billion in 2018, according to research firm eMarketer. The firm also indicates that mobile advertising comprises roughly 50% of the digital spending in the U.S. As such, FB stock should make up a bigger share of your portfolio.\n\nNotably, while Facebook did spook investors when it warned about higher capital expenses in 2017, this came on the back of strong third-quarter results. In this quarter, it reached $6.8 billion in advertising revenue (a 59% increase year-over-year).\n\nIn other words, FB's ad revenue is accelerating, not declining as investors feared. And this makes it tough to bet against Facebook stock or doubt any investment the company makes to enhance the platform.\n\nLikewise, even assuming Facebook does suffer decelerating ad growth, the company should be able to offset that weakness with a combination of higher user growth, time spent, live video, video ads, better ad targeting and higher revenues from Instagram and Messenger. Plus, we haven't even mentioned the growth possibilities with the Oculus VR/AR headset.\n\nBottom Line for FB Stock\n\nFB stock is currently trading around $127, down about 5% from its 52-week high of $133.50. The company will report fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings at the end of this month. For the quarter that ended December, Wall Street expects $1.30 in earnings per share on revenue of $8.49 billion, translating to year-over-year growth of 64% and 45%, respectively. Fiscal 2017 estimates calls for $5.18 per share, which prices Facebook stock at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 22.\n\nWhile that P/E is still four points above the S&P 500 Index , it calls for year-over-year earnings-per-share growth of almost 30%. That rate of growth deserves a higher multiple of around 28, which puts FB stock right around $150 per share. Good luck finding another tech stock with Facebook's market cap that can deliver this combination of growth and value.\n\nAs of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Still Marching Toward $150 appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "New Purchases: GOOG , EPD , DVMT ,\n\nAdded Positions:WPZ, FAX, BPL, TEI, EFA, PPT,\n\nReduced Positions:ACAS, EAD, EEM, PER, SDR, PAA, SPY, MMLP, EEP, ARNC,\n\nSold Out:PCI, MEMP, PBR, HYG, JNK, VTA, DSU, VNR, TIME, UIS,\n\nFor the details of Trust Asset Management LLC's stock buys and sells, go to http://www.gurufocus.com/StockBuy.php?GuruName=Trust+Asset+Management+LLC\n\nAmerican Capital Ltd (ACAS) - 2,111,988 shares, 19.9% of the total portfolio.

The company owned up to these errors no less than three times in 2016 -- in September , November, and December.\n\nThese metrics are absolutely critical to advertisers, who operate their own business and make ad spending decisions based on how well ads perform across platforms, including social media. We're talking about a wide range of metrics that measure everything from time spent in Instant Articles to app or site referrals to video completions to organic reach, among many others. As you might expect, the admissions don't instill a lot of confidence in advertisers looking to spend ad dollars on Facebook.\n\nGet a second opinion\n\nFacebook has said it will invest more heavily in additional third-party verifications (working with prominent analytics and measurement companies like comScore and Nielsen , among others) in an effort to validate the metrics that it provides to advertiser partners. But that isn't stopping advertisers from taking matters into their own hands.\n\nAdvertiser Perceptions released the results of a survey earlier this week that suggests 40% of advertisers are planning on conducting independent audits of Facebook's metrics around audience reach and ad delivery, according to Ad Age . It's possible that not all of these advertisers will actually perform the audits, but such a high level of distrust is disconcerting. Advertiser Perceptions Chief Strategy Officer Kevin Mannion told Ad Age that ad platforms need to get ahead of these issues and rebuild trust with advertisers, and the most effective way to do that is to expand third-party verifications.\n\nTo the point, half of advertisers are averse to buying ads on platforms that are deemed risky, like social media. Confidence in social media advertising is well below 50%, while there's much more confidence in the more mature area of search advertising, which is naturally dominated by Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . There's also a disconnect with where advertisers plan on increasing their spending this year; just 8% plan on spending more on Facebook's platform while maintaining the same budget with Google, while 36% are planning to spend more on Google's platform and leaving Facebook spending unchanged.\n\nThis all comes as investors fret over whether or not Facebook can hit consensus estimates for 2017, which call for roughly 35% revenue growth. The company does have many levers it can pull to grow the top line -- like ad price increases or increased engagement -- and in November the company said it ad load would be less of a contributing factor than in prior years. But it's pretty hard to increase prices if advertiser confidence is low, and investing more in third-party verifications could dent profits. Facebook has little choice, though; it needs to reinstill its customers' confidence.\n\nFind out why Facebook is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\n\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Once the fiercest of rivals, the two companies are far more similar than different today. Beyond their size and maturity, Apple and IBM shares have also been on a tear over the past 12 months.\n\nAAPL data by YCharts\n\nConsidering their many similarities, it's appropriate for investors to wonder whose shares are the more attractive potential buy today. To better answer this question, we'll put Apple and IBM stocks through a three-part analysis to gain a clearer sense of which one is the better buy now.\n\n1. Financial fortitude\n\nLet's cut to the chase here: Apple wins the contest of financial fortitude by a landslide. It deserves noting, though, that this is more due to Apple's historic profitability rather than any financial imprudence on IBM's part.\n\nCompany Cash and Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio Apple $237.5 billion $87.0 billion $65.8 billion 1.3 IBM $15.0 billion $42.4 billion $18.5 billion 1.2\n\nData sources: Apple investor relations, IBM investor relations, Yahoo! Finance.\n\nApple generates the bulk of its sales overseas, and its practice of keeping its cash offshore has triggered several not-so-small controversies in recent years. Apple held $216 billion of its cash overseas as of its most recent earnings report. That means Apple can't directly tap into the majority of its cash holdings without paying steep repatriation taxes. Rather, Apple borrows against its overseas cash to fund its capital return program.\n\nTurning to IBM, Big Blue similarly has its financial house in order. Though it has leveraged its balance sheet to a certain extent, IBM generates plenty of cash flow to both service its debts and reinvest in its business. However, Apple's overall profitability simply can't be beat, making it the easy winner in this portion of our analysis.\n\nWinner: Apple.\n\n2. Durable competitive advantages\n\nTurning to their competitive moats, Apple and IBM each enjoy some type of competitive advantage over their rivals. However, for both companies, their competitive advantages might not be as pronounced as they might initially seem.\n\nApple's platinum-grade brand, closed-loop operating system, consistent device leadership, and immense financial resources certainly all contribute to its ability to consistently generate above-average returns on capital. Some of these items should prove fairly straightforward. Apple's Fort Knox-esque cash reserves allow it to buy its way into virtually any industry that interests it. However, Apple's closed-loop software architecture receives far less attention but is arguably more important in terms of supporting Apple's competitive position.\n\nIn contrast to Alphabet 's Android or Microsoft 's Windows operating systems, Apple makes its software and app ecosystem available on its devices. That means users who migrate away from Apple's computers or mobile devices might not be able to bring their content with them, although third-party services such as Spotify have helped erode this situation in recent years. It also bears noting that Apple's product-driven sales model also presents something of a dormant risk. Should Apple somehow badly misstep with one of its annual device designs, its sales could suffer dramatically. Thanks to Apple's consistent device leadership, though, this situation has never come to fruition.\n\nAt IBM, the company's longtime relationships with customers and the large percentage of its sales that come from its legacy three-pronged business model provide it with something of a competitive moat as well. However, with the rise of the cloud-computing era and IBM's evolving place in that space, the company's competitive stance has perhaps weakened slightly. To cite one popular -- and important -- metric, IBM's sales have now declined for 18 consecutive quarters. IBM's backlog of prearranged service bookings also fell 0.7% in constant currency terms in its most recent quarter, although IBM still carries roughly 1.5 years' worth of revenue as bookings.\n\nWinner: tie.\n\n3. Valuation\n\nOn the surface, Apple and IBM appear to be comparably valued. In terms of their current P/E, forward P/E, and EV/EBITDA ratios, there appears to be little difference between the two at first glance.\n\nCompany P/E Ratio Forward P/E Ratio EV/EBITDA Apple 14.3 11.8 9.2 IBM 13.7 12.1 11.1\n\nData sources: Apple investor relations, IBM investor relations, Yahoo! Finance.\n\nPay extra attention to the EV/EBITDA ratio. It's arguably the most useful valuation metric, because it takes into account each company's equity, debt, and cash positions. This is particularly important to consider when analyzing a cash-rich company like Apple, which currently carries $12.73 in cash per share on its balance sheet. Subtracting that cash amount out gives investors a clearer sense of the value the market places on Apple's core operations.\n\nApple and IBM are both cheap compared with the market as a whole. In fact, after its recent rally, the S&P 500 benchmark trades at a valuation of 26, nearly double that of either Apple or IBM. This steep discount to the market reflects the view that Apple and IBM will probably exhibit little to no growth in the near term, which may not actually be the case. Though their revenue growth outlook isn't particularly rosy -- Apple and IBM sales are expected to rise 6% and fall 2%, respectively, this year -- both companies are among the most effective users of dividends and stock buybacks to drive shareholder returns. In terms of the overall attractiveness of their valuations, though, Apple wins this category as well.\n\nWinner: Apple.\n\nAnd the winner is... Apple\n\nApple's edge in two of the three categories examined here make the iPhone maker the more attractive option today.

More recently, the company acquired a controlling interest in Lazada for $1 billion, valuing the Singaporean e-commerce giant at $1.5 billion. In addition to the core e-commerce business, Alibaba has invested significantly in non-commerce businesses such as cloud computing, internet infrastructure, digital media and entertainment. While the online retail and wholesale business continue to grow and generate profits for Alibaba, the company is looking to diversify and look at long-term growth areas. Among these areas of growth, its investment in Indian online payment gateway and e-wallet PayTM could be key for Alibaba in the long run. Below we take a look at the factors driving growth in the space and how Alibaba can gain from this investment.\n\nAccording to our estimates, the non-commerce businesses make up around 8% of our $88 price estimate for Alibaba's stock . Our price estimate is slightly lower than the current market price.\n\nSee our complete analysis for Alibaba\n\nPayTM As A Lucrative Investment\n\n\n\nPayTM is an online payment gateway and e-wallet which was founded in 2010 and has since grown to be one of the largest such companies in India. According to data compiled by the Economic Times, Alibaba and Ant Financial Services Group (formerly Alipay) combined own a 40% stake in PayTM, which is estimated to be worth around $5 billion. Alibaba has invested a total of around $1.5 billion in PayTM at valuations of $800 million and $3.4 billion in the past.\n\nThis investment has become even more significant for Alibaba in the wake of the decision by the Indian Government to demonetize 86% of the available currency in circulation in November last year. The move was made by the government in an attempt to promote digital payments instead of cash-based transactions to curb the black market and counterfeit currency in circulation. Subsequently, digital transactions including debit card payments, credit card payments, and e-wallet payments surged by 100% in the month following the announcement. As a result, PayTM observed a 400% surge in traffic, a 200% increase in the total number of app downloads and 1000% growth in money added to e-wallets. In the 10-day period following the news, PayTM added around 20 million users to its total user base. PayTM now has a user base of around 170 million, which is just shy of PayPal's ( PYPL ) 196 million users.\n\nSince it is still in a relatively nascent stage, PayTM's monetization per user is much lower than what PayPal makes per user. PayPal's net revenue for 2015 stood at around $9.2 billion, while PayTM generated around $130 million in revenues for fiscal year ended March 2016. In the long run, however, PayTM's business is likely to pick up significantly given the expected growth in the digital payments market in India. According to a recent report by the Boston Consulting Group, the total market for digital payments in India could grow at a CAGR of almost 60% through 2020 to become a $500 billion market.\n\nLosses Likely To Continue In The Near Term\n\nAlibaba reported segment-wise margins for the first time in the earnings report for the June-ended quarter last year. According to Alibaba's filings, the company's non-commerce segments combined reported an operating loss while the online retail and wholesale businesses reported profits. Alibaba is investing heavily in digital media, cloud computing, online video streaming and other new ventures, banking on long-term growth. With Alibaba's deep pockets and intent to capture a significant chunk of the growing Asian markets, PayTM could be a key strategic investment for the company.\n\nView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):\n\nGlobal Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap\n\nMore Trefis Research", "Hindsight, as they say, is 20/20. And it may just work in Apple’s (AAPL) favor.\n\nFrom criticism such as poor design or what some perceived to be the product’s ability to infringe on personal space, there were tons of reasons why Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google Glass failed. Even advocates of the product couldn’t decide whether Glass should be used as a fashionable device all the time or just for specific practical functions.\n\nApparently, none of these reasons matter to Apple, which is rumored to be interested in its own glass product. And given Apple’s often unspoken strategy of not needing to be first to market, but perfecting the market, Apple — according to multiple reports — may be intent on using Google's failure to its advantage.\n\nRumors now suggest augmented reality is Apple’s next big thing — a pair of augmented reality glasses, to be specific. Apple blog site 9to5Mac on Tuesday said the Cupertino-based iPhone maker is working with with optical company Carl Zeiss to create the glasses, which has been described as a “light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses.\"\n\nExactly when these glasses will be released is unknown, though several reports suggest they could be launched as early as this year or in 2018. Of course, Apple hasn’t commented on this latest rumor. An email to company requesting more details was not immediately returned. And I’m not expecting one.\n\nHowever, in a recent post on Facebook (FB) tech evangelist Robert Scoble noted that Zeiss employee confirmed rumors that both companies \"are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year.”\n\n“AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,” Tim Cook said in a July 26 conference call with analysts. “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.”\n\nIn an interview with ABC news last September, Cook — though he stopped short of divulging specific plans — made it clear that augmented reality was his preferred route over virtual reality.\n\nGiven Cook’s apparent interest in AR, partnering with Zeiss makes perfect sense. According to tech site Engadget, Zeiss’ strategy for the product is \"to develop these curved lenses and then partner with a technology company that can develop the computing hardware and software.” Given Apple’s ecosystem strengths and its ability to control both the hardware and software, it would be the ideal partner for Zeiss.\n\nIn short, while Google Glass, announced in 2012, was likely too advanced for its time, Apple’s AR ambitions seems well timed. That, however, doesn’t guarantee its AR glasses — whatever they will be called — will be a hit. But to the extent Apple can sell the reality of the product and not just seek to capitalize on the hype, it would have already succeeded where Google failed.", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUp until recently, mega-tech had been a bunch of sleeping giants but no longer. After lagging for a while, the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQ ) plowed into record territory this week. Strength came from the likes of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ). Others such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are also working on bullish setups.\n\nSource: Apple\n\nThe earnings season will undoubtedly make or break these set ups. An easy way to bet long this upside potential is with a blanket long position on the QQQ. But today I want to focus on AAPL based on a specific thesis - the Samsung (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) effect.\n\nYes, I know it's been overly exposed. But I will share my personal experience to illustrate my thoughts.\n\nFor years, my household has sided with Samsung phones. Until we recently had a phone literally catch fire. In our efforts to fix the phone (and while dealing with the thousand hoops that were imposed upon us) we ended up switching phones makers and providers.\n\nThe point of the story is this: One out of the three new phones ended up being an iPhone 7. This wasn't because we were shopping for it, but rather that it was suggested by the salesperson and offered free by the provider. Conclusion: AAPL will gain incremental business from Samsung regardless of who is shopping for what. It's what they call \"pin action.\"\n\nFundamentally, I reiterate my statement that the AAPL machine will continue to offer an attractive stock value. But I have very little faith that Tim Cook is the right leader for it. What I do see attractive here is the technical upside potential. AAPL stock has the potential to retest the highs. The set up is available for the bulls.\n\nThe Trade: Buy AAPL Mar $120/$125 debit call spread. This is a bullish trade for which I pay $1.80 per contract. This is my maximum potential loss. If Apple stock rallies past my spread, I stand to double my money. Options are time sensitive, so the March contract allows 65 days to be proven right.\n\nIn this case, I want to hedge my bets by selling downside risk against AAPL value to lower my upside entry cost. I don't do this, however, unless I believe in the value of AAPL stock against which I am selling risk.\n\n\n\nThe Bank: Sell AAPL Jan 2018 $90 put. This is a bullish trade for which I collect $3 per contract. Selling naked puts is dangerous and I only do it if I am willing and able to own AAPL stock at the strike sold. If AAPL stock falls over 25% I could be assigned the stock. In which case, $87 per share would be my breakeven price. Anything lower would accrue losses.\n\n\n\nSince AAPL earnings are not due for two weeks, I will likely delay selling the puts just in case they decide to correct a little.\n\nIt is important to note that the short-term reactions to earnings is a binary event. Meaning it's more gambling than investing. The quality of the report doesn't matter as much as it should. Wall Street is unpredictable with its reactions.\n\nFurthermore, markets in general are at all-time-high levels. So if Trump doesn't deliver on much of his promises, we could see a market-wide correction. As long as my downside put level is not breached, any revenues captured from selling the long bet would be pure profits.\n\nI am not required to hold trade into their expiration dates. I can close any of them for partial gains or losses.\n\nNicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com .

(AAPL) Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSince hitting a low of near $90 per share in May, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares have been marching higher, and could crack $120 in early trade on Jan. 12. While Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) board member (and President Trump bestie) Peter Thiel claims \"the age of Apple is over,\" and the company is continuing to lose low-end business in China to local rivals, this Christmas may be its best ever.\n\nSource: Apple\n\nIt would have to be pretty spectacular to beat 2015's $75.87 billion in sales and $18.31 billion, $3.28 per share, in net income.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is it will come close on both fronts, with revenues of $76.82 billion and net income of $3.22 per share of AAPL stock. Its cash hoard, $237 billion at the end of October , is continuing to grow and it will nearly top the entire GDP of Finland.\n\nWhat investors should be asking, however, isn't what Apple has done, but what it is going to do.\n\nAAPL's Future: Augmenting, Grounding Reality\n\nStart with augmented reality, the technology you saw last year, in a primitive way, with the Pokemon Go phenomenon.\n\nAt CES, the German Carl Zeiss Meditec NPV (OTCMKTS: CZMWF ), which has a pair of Virtual Reality goggles in the market, had a booth in the augmented reality area but no product to show. Although it is still a rumor, Robert Scoble discovered solid evidence that the company is working with Apple on \"mixed reality\" glasses that could debut next year.\n\nAugmented reality, as opposed to virtual reality, superimposes computer data on an existing world view. In the workplace, it can give repairmen instructions as they work. In addition to superimposing games on your worldview, it can also deliver marketing messages as you walk, or interface with your smartphone so you can see your directions as you drive, and don't forget what is on your to-do list.\n\nSuch a heads-up display from Apple would be a real breakthrough, transforming the way people work with technology from looking down at screens to looking up and saying what they want.\n\nThe breakthrough would lie in creating an interface that is not distracting to either the wearer or the people around them, as the \"Google glass\" effort from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) proved to be.\n\nThat's not all. AAPL has also patented an armband that could deliver a host of health indicators , not just blood pressure and heart rate, to the wearer and their doctor. Wearables are currently stuck as fashion devices because they lack the precision and utility needed for Food and Drug Administration approval, but breaking through that wall would open a multi trillion-dollar market.\n\nApple Is Taking the High End\n\nWhile most analysts focus on absolute market share, investors know that the key to a mass technology market lies in who has the high end, where the biggest profits lie. I was shocked over the holidays to find I am now the only member of my family still carrying an Android phone. All my relatives now have iPhones.\n\nThis not only gives Apple 90% of the market's profits, but allows it to extend the ecosystem back to the PC, where it is now the fourth-largest player in a stabilizing market and, on a per-unit basis, the most profitable.\n\nWhile Android developers struggle to get free apps onto phones, AAPL's iOS will pass $1 trillion in revenue sometime this year, delivering $20 billion per year to developers and justifying its spending billions of dollars to build-out a network of cloud data centers.\n\nSlice Intelligence estimates that Apple even had one-quarter of the wireless headphone market this Christmas with those Airpod units that analysts laughed at a few months ago. That's nearly as much as much as Beats and Bose combined.\n\nSo Much Winning for AAPL Stock\n\nThe bottom line is that Apple is still winning.\n\nThe iPad people thought was dead? It had a spectacular Christmas. The Apple Watch you thought was dead? It sold out. AAPL doubled-up on device activations compared with Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ).\n\nThe earnings multiple for Apple, based on what most people considered a bad year, is 14.5. That's cheap. That's why AAPL stock is not one you trade, but one you own.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

(AAPL) Stock Is Still Winning in 2017 appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "\n\nImage source: Waymo.\n\nAlphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google just spun out its self-driving vehicle project, Waymo, into its own subsidairy company last month , and already it's making huge strides in the automotive space. Waymo CEO John Krafcik, announced at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit this week that the company has reduced the cost of its LIDAR sensor by a whopping 90%.\n\nLIDAR -- which uses lasers to map the vicinity, in this case allowing a vehicle to see everything around it -- is one of the most expensive technologies on a self-driving vehicle, and cutting is cost could pave the way to profitability for Waymo.\n\nWhat you get for the money\n\nLIDAR is how self-driving vehicles see the world around them. The technology is pretty easy to spot on a car -- it's usually encased in a dome atop the vehicle. Inside that, a laser spits out pulses of light that, when reflected off of objects, give the car detailed information about the locations and movement of whatever is around it.\n\nWaymo's new LIDAR system works the same way as earlier versions of the technology, but it's massively cheaper. Given that those older systems cost about $75,000, Krafcik's latest announcement implies that Waymo's new LIDAR probably costs about $7,500.\n\nThe more expensive LIDAR systems are arguably more accurate, but don't think that it means Waymo will be using a sub-par system for its upcoming self-driving services.\n\n\"The detail we capture is so high that not only can we detect pedestrians all around us, but we can tell which direction they're facing,\" Krafcik said. \"This is incredibly important, as it helps us more accurately predict where someone will walk next.\"\n\nWhy cheaper is better\n\nOne of the likely reasons why Alphabet spun Waymo out into its own company is because it believes Waymo can stand on its own and produce its own revenue.\n\nWaymo has said that it'll use its software and hardware for several different services, including personal transportation, ride hailing, logistics, and public transportation solutions. We'll likely get our first glimpse of its intentions later this year when it launches a service with Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU) . Waymo will begin testing self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans on public roads next month.\n\nBut just as with any company, Waymo will need to focus on becoming profitable. Google's been pretty strict lately with those of its subsidiary companies that aren't making money, and has paused several projects (I'm looking at you Google Fiber ) that haven't panned out as expected. Waymo will succeed or fail based on its ability to turn its promising tech into tangible -- and lucrative -- products and services.\n\nThe self-driving market will be worth an estimated $77 billion by 2035, and a total of nearly 76 million vehicles with some level of autonomy are expected to have been sold by that year.\n\nAs with any other technology, reducing the cost so that consumers can afford it is key to Waymo's success. This latest LIDAR cost reduction is great news for the company, and it means Waymo's ride-hailing service -- which it aims to launch later this year -- is one step closer to reality.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares)\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Image source: Apple.\n\nYou win some, you lose some.\n\nKantar has released its most recent estimates on numerous smartphone markets around the world, covering the three months ending November 2016 before the holiday shopping season picked up steam. Well, the news is mixed. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was able to chip away at Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) lead in key geographies in Europe as well as the U.S., but continued to slip in greater China, where local manufacturers are flooding the market with low-cost Android devices.\n\nLet's dig through the numbers.\n\nThe good\n\nThe iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 6s were the top three handsets within the U.S. for the period, grabbing a combined 31% market share. Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge came in at the No. 4 and No. 5 spots and accounted for 29% of sales. Aggressive carrier promotions helped both the Mac maker and the South Korean conglomerate, as all the domestic carriers had various promotions to get a free flagship devices. Overall, iOS grew within the U.S. by 6.4 percentage points to grab a 43.5% market share.\n\nInterestingly, Google's decision to partner with Verizon as the exclusive carrier distributing the Pixel seems to be paying off, with the Pixel comprising about 1.3% of all smartphone sales; over half of those new phones were activated at Big Red. That may not sound like a whole lot, but it's actually impressive when you consider that Nexus and Pixel phones have never been high-volume devices, so 1.3% is actually pretty good within that context.\n\nIn Europe, Apple did particularly well within the U.K., where it saw its market share jump 9.1 percentage points, and now has a 48.3% share in the country. iOS also jumped by 6.5 percentage points in France to a 24.5% market share. In the broader EU5 (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K.), Apple had 24.6% share of all smartphone sales.\n\nThe bad\n\nApple has seen its position in China deteriorate over the past year or so, while local players have been able to rise and chip away at both Apple and larger Android original equipment manufacturers. Android now accounts for 80% of smartphones sold in the Middle Kingdom, which is the largest smartphone market in the world. iOS fell from 25.3% of urban China to just 19.9%, although Apple was up modestly on a sequential basis. The only silver lining here is that the iPhone 7 was the single best-selling device in urban China, grabbing 6.6% of all sales.\n\nThe problem is that there are so many other low-cost Android choices out there that make up the rest of the market (Huawei and Oppo now represent nearly 40% of the market). Apple's business in China is still on a long-term upward trajectory and I have little doubt that the company will recover, but it's definitely seen better days.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Apple\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The idea was to beam internet access from the sky to get more people logging on from remote places to access information and probably use both companies' web services.\n\nThe team from Titan was brought into X in late 2015, and the research lab ended its exploration of high-altitude drones for internet access.\n\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\n\nhttp://www.rttnews.com\n\nThis article appears in: Technology", "New Purchases: SPY , GOOG , AMZN , C, NFLX, QQQ, GM, PCLN, LLY, PANW,\n\nAdded Positions:AAPL, FB, GILD, GOOGL, NXPI, MDLZ, STZ, IBB, RDS.A, COL,\n\nReduced Positions:GLD, CELG, DXJ, BIIB, V, FXB, K, MPC, GS, NVDA,\n\nSold Out:LNKD, LMT, CMG, AGN, VZ, BP, VXX, MCD, YHOO, CMCSA,\n\nFor the details of SIMPLEX TRADING, LLC's stock buys and sells, go to http://www.gurufocus.com/StockBuy.php?GuruName=SIMPLEX+TRADING%2C+LLC\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ( SPY ) - 227,870 shares, 5.38% of the total portfolio.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) is all too familiar with Andy Rubin. The creator of Android led the effort to knock iOS off its perch and take a commanding lead in the smartphone platform wars. With a critical iPhone 8 release scheduled for 2017, Rubin is once again poised to be a thorn in AAPL's side with news he is preparing to launch his own Essential smartphone.\n\nSource: Global Playground\n\nIf the new AI-powered, flagship smartphone from Rubin's company lives up to the hype, the Samsung (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) Galaxy S8 and the next Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Pixel Phone may be the least of Apple's worries this year.\n\nRe-Introducing Andy Rubin\n\nA one-time Apple engineer, Andy Rubin quickly became a serious threat to the company's mobile ambitions. In 2003, he co-founded Android. When Alphabet's Google bought the mobile operating system in 2005, he became the Google senior vice president responsible for Android.\n\nRubin continued in the position until 2013, when he took over Google's robotics division before leaving the company altogether in 2014.\n\nNow, Rubin is back in the spotlight with his own company - Essential - which is focused on artificial intelligence. And it features a flagship smartphone as its product centerpiece.\n\nThe Essential Smartphone\n\nBloomberg was the first to report on Andy Rubin's new company after CES 2017. According to Bloomberg , Rubin is in discussion with mobile carriers, including Sprint Corp (NYSE: S ), about the Essential smartphone.\n\nThe device is still in the prototype stage, but sources say Rubin is planning to launch it by the middle of the year, at a $649 price point. That would mean a new flagship smartphone hitting shelves just months before the iPhone 8 . It would add to the tough competition of the Galaxy S8, which will be heavily promoted by Samsung, as well as the follow-up version of Google's Pixel Phone.\n\nThe Essential smartphone may pose an even bigger threat to the iPhone 8 than these two Android front-runners.\n\nBloomberg's sources describe a smartphone with a larger display than the iPhone 7 Plus, but a smaller form factor because the Essential smartphone has an edge-to-edge display that lacks bezels. A magnetic connector does double-duty for charging and as a port for hardware accessories, including a spherical 360-degree camera. The screen could be pressure-sensitive, like the iPhone's. And Essential is reportedly working on a ceramic back, which would utilize the same premium material used in AAPL's latest flagship Apple Watch Edition Series 2 .\n\nBehind it all, the Essential smartphone would feature advanced AI technology, which would take on Siri.\n\nIs This a Real Threat to the iPhone 8?\n\nOn one hand, it's easy to dismiss the Essential smartphone. It's still in the prototype phase, and if its design is finalized, it may ultimately lack some of the features like the ceramic back. There are big unanswered questions, too, including what operating system it will run.\n\nAnd then there's the dubious success rate of companies trying to muscle their way into a mature smartphone market. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) found this out the hard way when its Fire Phone flopped several years ago.\n\nOn the other hand, Andy Rubin has a proven track record. He's very well-connected in the industry and has been successful in raising capital. His Playground Global hardware incubator raised $300 million in 2015 . According the Bloomberg report, Rubin is actively in talks with not just Sprint over distribution, but also Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (OTCMKTS: HNHPF ) - better known as Foxconn - as a manufacturing partner for the Essential smartphone.\n\nRubin also has a team of engineers recruited from Google and Apple working on the phone, with a former Samsung executive heading up marketing.\n\nThe Essential smartphone could be a credible threat. Its mid-2017 target release date gives it a shot: Samsung is still recovering from the Galaxy Note 7 PR nightmare, Google's Pixel Phone has yet to capture significant market share and the iPhone 8 will be months away.\n\nIf the Essential smartphone lives up to its billing, with a powerful AI and premium design, and gets a push from carriers like Sprint, it could be a big deal.\n\nThat would be a serious problem for AAPL, which is counting on the iPhone 8 launch to re-ignite its stalled iPhone sales.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace:\n\nThe post Apple Inc. Faces a New Threat to the iPhone 8 (AAPL) appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Image source: Yandex N.V.\n\nWhat happened\n\nShares of Yandex N.V. (NASDAQ: YNDX) climbed 29.5% in 2016, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence , after the Russian internet search leader demonstrated broad-based growth in its first three quarterly reports of the year. Yandex also made progress in its antitrust complaint in the country against Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) global internet search behemoth, Google.\n\nSo what\n\nTo be sure, essentially all of Yandex's share price appreciation last year came on the heels of three successive quarterly earnings beats , punctuated by strong growth from each of its search and portal, e-commerce, taxi, classifieds, and \"experiments\" segments' revenue.\n\nBut shares have also taken a breather since Yandex's most recent quarterly report in late October. At the time, Yandex confirmed fiscal Q3 2016 revenue had climbed 25% year over year to 19.29 billion Russian Rubles (RUR), including 21% growth in search and portal revenue, to 17.48 billion RUR; 45% growth in e-commerce revenue, to 1.2 billion RUR; 151% growth in taxi revenue, to 587 million RUR; and a 45% increase in classifieds revenue, to 352 million RUR. Revenue from Yandex's \"experiments\" segment, which notably includes media segments like Yandex.Radio and Yandex.Music, also nearly doubled, to 210 million RUR.\n\nAt the same time, Yandex saw its share of the Russian search market (including mobile) decline to 55.9% for the quarter, compared to 57% and 57.6% in the second and first quarters of the year, respectively. To blame, Yandex management stated, was a renewed push from Google on its own applications through notifications and other activities.\n\nYandex also confirmed to investors that the Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) had previously issued an \"unprecedented decision prescription to Google to cease anti-competitive practices,\" namely referring to Google's requirement for pre-installed Google products and services on their Android mobile devices. That decision was upheld by two separate courts since then and came into force in August. But because Google had not \"implemented the FAS prescription,\" according to Yandex, the FAS opened an administrative investigation into its noncompliance.\n\nNow what\n\nUnless we receive further clarification in the meantime, you can bet Yandex investors will be listening closely for any updates to the antitrust complaint when Yandex releases fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results next month. For now, however, given its relative strength and broad growth despite competitive pressure from Google, it's no surprise that Yandex stock staged such an impressive rally in 2016.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Yandex\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The equation took up the entire page, and he sat there staring at it for quite awhile. After I thought about how glad I am to not be in school anymore, I started thinking about how jumping into a new investing market can be intimidating. Like the math equation, it can be hard to make sense of all the information on the page.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be this way, especially if you closely follow what smart companies are doing in new segments and pair that with some good ol' fashioned research.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is one such opportunity where companies are making big bets on it and where the research backs up its potential. And if AI pans out the way many are thinking, then 2017 may be a very good year to get on board with this technological shift.\n\nAI is at an inflection point\n\nIn 2016, the AI market was worth just $644 million, according to Tractica. This year, that amount will nearly double and then grow exponentially from there. Take a look:\n\n\n\nData source: Tractica and Statista .\n\nClearly, we're still at the beginning of AI's revenue possibilities, and its opportunity will accelerate over the coming the years until it reaches $37.8 billion less than 10 years from now.\n\nGrowth in the AI market will be spurred on by many large tech companies that implement AI into their current businesses. For example, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) uses its own internally developed AI programs to read the posts we put on Facebook and understand the context they're written in. The company's DeepText program reads thousands of posts in just seconds and does so across 20 different languages. Facebook also uses deep learning to tag our friends in photos, and is even using AI to identify people (and their voices!) in videos.\n\nBut AI is expanding its reach outside of the technology sector as well. There's plenty of talk about self-driving cars these days ( I've done my fair share ) and that's because the number of vehicles worldwide with some level of autonomy will hit 76 million by 2035 -- and be worth $77 billion by that year.\n\nThat growth is being fueled, at least in part, by AI. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) is using its graphics processors (GPUs) to create some of the most sophisticated image processing supercomputers, like the company's Drive PX 2 . The computer is being used by 80 automakers and auto suppliers already, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) recently said that it would use some of NVIDIA's technology in its next version of its semi-autonomous Autopilot driving feature.\n\nTesla is itself becoming a leader in AI technologies, and back in October, the company posted a video of its self-driving AI driving a person around in one of its vehicles -- completely hands-free -- as it navigated stop signs, bicyclists, and foggy roads.\n\nImage source: Tesla.\n\nOK, so technology companies are obviously betting on AI's future, and NVIDIA is proving that the automotive sector will bank on AI as well, but it's important to note that governments are betting on AI's growth as well.\n\nChina announced last year that its government will invest in new AI technologies over the next three years, as it tries to create its own $15 billion AI market. And even the U.S. government has taken notice of China's recent focus on artificial intelligence. In a report released back in October, the White House said that Chinese scientists are publishing far more AI research than American scientists and that their work is being cited more often. The U.S. then urged more AI research and development spending in order to catch up and improve economic growth.\n\nThe South Korean government recently turned its attention to AI as well. After Google 's DeepMind AI beat a South Korean grandmaster Go player in an exhibition match in Seoul, the country pledged $863 million to develop more AI technology and called on private companies to invest even more.\n\nThere's no turning back now\n\nWith so many companies (and leading world powers) focusing their attention on AI, there's no stopping the momentum now. Investors waiting around to see how AI plays out could be left in the dust, as this technological shift begins to speed up even faster this year. Of course, there's no guarantee that 2017 will be the best year to invest in AI. But if all of the AI focus from 2016 spills into this year, then it certainly looks like a good bet.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Nearly a year ago, Google CEO Sundar Pichai stepped in as the guest writer of Alphabet's annual founders' letter and noted:\n\n\"... the next big step will be for the very concept of the 'device' to fade away. Over time, the computer itself -- whatever its form factor -- will be an intelligent assistant helping you through your day. We will move from mobile first to an AI first world.\"\n\nDeep learning uses artificial neural networks to recreate our capacity to learn. Image source: Pixabay .\n\nLet's take a look at what AI is and how Google is working to be at the forefront of the move to an AI-first world. Most references to AI actually refer to machine learning, and more specifically, deep learning, a specific discipline within AI. So what is deep learning? It's when a computer simulation of the human brain called a neural network is used to recreate our capacity to learn. It is fed a multitude of examples and complex algorithms that \"teach\" it to recognize similarities and distinguish differences. In the simplest terms, the computer learns to recognize patterns from massive quantities of data.\n\nMachine learning ninjas at Google\n\nGoogle systems are benefiting from deep learning. Image source: Pixabay\n\nEngineers proficient in deep learning are currently estimated to be about 10% of the company's 25,000 engineers and a leader of Google's machine learning effort has said he'd like that number to be closer to 100%. To help spread machine learning, the company created the Machine Learning Ninja Program, which identifies talented coders and embeds them in its machine-learning teams. When the six-month program is over, they fan out across the company seeking new ways to apply machine learning to existing systems.This strategy is paying off. For instance, it freed employees from cataloging street addresses captured by Google's Street View cars updating its Maps service: Google Brain now completes the tedious and time-consuming task using image recognition.\n\nGoogle helped solidify its lead in deep learning two years ago when it acquired London-based AI company DeepMind for $600 million. It has since used machine learning technology to arrange its data centers more efficiently, based on how their power use had changed over time. Expanding on that success, Google now uses DeepMind technology to control the power consumption in those data centers. By manipulating servers and cooling systems and controlling over 120 condition-based variables, the company achieved a 15% improvement in power usage efficiency and a 40% reduction in cooling costs. These hundreds of millions of dollars in savings over several years will help recoup the cost to acquire DeepMind and there are plans to roll this strategy out to other potential applications. DeepMind's technology is also available to help companies that run on Google's cloud to improve their own energy efficiency.\n\nIncreased functionality for consumers\n\nConsumer products are seeing dramatic improvements. Image source: Pixabay .\n\nGoogle Assistant is where Google's AI most directly meets people. It powers the Google Home smart speaker and, in future, will be able to stream music, movies, and TV to the growing ecosystem of Google-branded devices including Android TV, Chromecast, and speakers. It will also provide deeper personalization resulting from data located in Maps, Calendar, Keep, and other services. In several recent unscientific tests, Google Assistant was found to be superior to its competitors. One key selling point is the ability to answer follow-up questions. .\n\nOther examples abound. Users of Google Translate saw a dramatic improvement in its usefulness and accuracy as applying advances in natural-language processing reduced error rates by up to 85%, making greater progress in six weeks than the service had seen in the previous 10 years. Google Photos now has the uncanny ability to locate a specific photo based on a description by the user. Gmail's Inbox introduced a Smart Reply feature that suggests three potential responses to an email that users can choose with a tap, rather than having to type an answer.\n\nThe Foolish final word\n\nGoogle has been increasingly focusing its efforts on AI and planning for an AI-centric world. While it typically does not release the terms of acquisitions, it is telling that Google has acquired 11 AI-related companies in the last five years and applying AI technology to increasing its competitive advantage and positioning for the future.\n\nWhile it will be difficult to quantify some benefits, we already know deep learning can increase revenue and efficiency, and make the ecosystem more productive and valuable to consumers. This moonshot will continue to pay dividends.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares)\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Which companies will emerge as the huge winners with these major changes? We asked three of our healthcare contributors to weigh in on the subject. Here's why AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) , and Veeva Systems (NYSE: VEEV) could represent bold bets on the future of healthcare.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nFinding the elusive fountain of youth?\n\nGeorge Budwell ( AbbVie ): If anything qualifies as a moonshot effort, it's the partnership between AbbVie and Alphabet to cure age-related diseases. In 2014, AbbVie signed on to act as the pharma expert behind Alphabet's Calico LLC life-sciences company. The basic idea driving this unique partnership between a tech and a pharma giant is to develop breakthrough treatments for diseases like cancer and dementia that are often strongly associated with getting older.\n\nWhile the two companies haven't revealed much about the collaboration -- beyond their plan to work out the molecular and genetic mechanisms promoting longevity in naked mole rats -- AbbVie has already sunk a hefty $500 million into this speculative effort. That's a strong sign that AbbVie is indeed serious about pursuing novel therapies with game-changing medical and commercial potential -- even if they do come with an unusually high risk of failure.\n\nThe bottom line: AbbVie and Alphabet's anti-aging collaboration is apparently still in the idea stage, based on the lack of actual clinical trials -- but it could one day revolutionize modern medicine, given its ambitious goal of understanding the molecular foundation of the aging process in humans.\n\nRise of the robots\n\nKeith Speights (Verb Surgical) : Science fiction is becoming a reality all around us. Robots might not rule the world, but they're becoming increasingly important in nearly every area -- including healthcare. That's why I really like what Verb Surgical is doing.\n\nVerb Surgical was founded by Alphabet and Johnson & Johnson in 2015. The goal of the two big companies in forming Verb was to develop a new generation of robot-assisted surgical systems using big data and machine learning.\n\nThe vision is for these robot surgical systems to analyze a video library of hundreds of previous surgeries and recommend where the surgeon should cut. This system would be smaller and less expensive than current systems like Intuitive Surgical 's daVinci robotic surgery device.\n\nVerb Surgical doesn't have to start from scratch to make this possible. J&J already developed a basic prototype of the robot, and Alphabet already has the machine-learning technology necessary for the anatomical-recognition software.\n\nIf Verb Surgical succeeds -- and I suspect it will -- the future of healthcare will mean that surgeons will have plenty of help from smart technology. Instead of Mr. Roboto, we might be saying Dr. Roboto in just a few years.\n\nManaging data to make the future possible\n\nBrian Stoffel (Veeva Systems) : On the surface, my pick is nowhere near as bold or exciting as George's or Keith's, but I think it's every bit as vital to the healthcare sector churning out life-changing solutions in the decades to come. Veeva Systems was founded when Peter Gassner -- then an executive at salesforce.com -- realized that pharmaceutical companies had unique cloud needs that the one-size-fits-all model at salesforce couldn't adequately address.\n\nSo he started out by founding Veeva and focusing on customer relationship management with his Veeva CRM Suite. For most of the time since the company's 2007 founding, this has been Veeva's bread-and-butter business.\n\nBut over the past two years, a big new product -- Veeva Vault -- has been turning heads. The application allows employees across a company to use a single portal to record all of the relevant data necessary to bring a drug from the idea stage to clinical testing to market -- all while complying with the necessary regulations.\n\nIt's been a huge hit: In the most recent quarter, bookings for Vault exceeded CRM, and reviews have been so positive that Veeva will start offering Vault as a product outside of the life-sciences industry this year.\n\nBut the bottom line is this: Veeva's moat comes from both high switching costs and the gobs of data it collects to better serve its customers because its product can quickly become engrained within a company's standard operating procedure. It will be a force for bringing the medical field's bold bets to fruition, and it could yield huge results for patient investors.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Veeva Systems\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

So to help with that, here are two segments (among many) where Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) are using AI to grow their businesses.\n\nAI-dvertising\n\nAdvertising is probably one of the least thought-of segments when it comes to artificial intelligence applications, but Facebook and Google know better. Both of these companies have made big bets on AI -- and most of them are aimed at building up their advertising businesses.\n\nWe all know that the free services we get from Google (Gmail, Google Photos, Google Drive, Search, etc.) aren't really free. Consumers pay for these with their data by giving up some of their information (what we search for, the subjects of our emails, the photos we upload, etc.), and Google takes that information and tries to serve us ads it thinks are relevant to us.\n\nSo far, the company does a pretty good job at it, considering it earned $19.8 billion in advertising last quarter. But even Google thinks it can do better, and that's why it's recently acquired 11 AI companies.\n\nOne of its most publicized AI acquisitions, a company called DeepMind, was able to beat a human at a complex strategy game called Go, and has also developed a sound-recognition program that it says mimics the human voice and sounds more natural than any other text-to-speech system. DeepMind has long-term implications for Google's AI plans, but the company is also looking to more practical AI applications right now too.\n\nFor example, the company introduced a Smart Bidding learning system last year, which is an automated bidding system for AdWords and DoubleClick customers. Smart Bidding uses machine learning that's built on the company's other AI systems for Google Assistant, Google Photos, and AlphaGo, and helps \"maximize the accuracy\" of ads. The company says that Smart Bidding's algorithms, \"... factor in a wider range of parameters that impact performance than a single person or team could compute.\"\n\nWhile Google is helping advertisers make more efficient bids, Facebook is using AI to better sort all the content its nearly 1.8 billion users upload to its services. Facebook is very adept at sorting this content and selling ads around it as well -- it earned $6.8 billion in adversing revenue in its most recent quarter -- but it's using AI to make improvements.\n\nFacebook is expanding its AI presence both through its own internal research and a handful of acquisitions over the past few years. The company uses AI for facial recognition of photos its users upload, and even to figure out which stories and posts it will show in our newsfeed.\n\nBut the company also developed its own DeepText AI system which \"... can understand with near-human accuracy the textual content of several thousands posts per second, spanning more than 20 languages.\" That's an impressive use of AI, and it shows just how much Facebook needs learning systems to sort all of the content it receives so it can better serve ads around it.\n\nSelf-driving cars\n\nIf you're not interested in how AI is helping Facebook and Google sells ads, then perhaps self-driving cars might be of more interest.\n\nGoogle is doing a lot in the self-driving car space, of course (particularly with its new Waymo company ) -- but let's turn our attention toward NVIDIA for this section.\n\nThe GPU-maker earns most of its revenues from its dominant position in the gaming market , but NVIDIA's focus on artificial intelligence is helping to pave the way for self-driving transportation.\n\nNVIDIA's Drive PX 2 self-driving supercomputer uses AI technology to collect 1.8 million data points per second and then process that information in a way that tells the car what objects are around it and how to respond to them. Drive PX is already used by 80 automakers and automotive suppliers, but the company isn't stopping there.\n\nNVIDIA has a powerful cloud-based supercomputer called DGX-1 that it says could eventually help off-load some of Drive PX's AI processing and make self-driving cars even smarter. DGX-1 uses neural networking to process information in similar ways to what humans do, and is 12 times faster than previous GPU-powerd AI supercomputers. That's becoming increasingly important, because between now and 2035 there will be 76 million vehicles worldwide with some level of autonomy.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAll of the companies listed above are leaders in the AI space, and each is continuing to make huge strides. Facebook, Alphabet, and NVIDIA aren't exclusively AI companies, of course, but each is creating huge opportunities for their own businesses, and investors should take note.\n\nKnowing where to begin with AI investments may seem like a daunting task, but betting on key technology players that are already implementing AI to grow their businesses is a great place to start.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Consider these statistics from Checkmarx: Cybercrime is expected to cost businesses over $2 trillion annually by 2019, four times as much as 2015. In the U.S., a breach costs a company an estimated $15.4 million on average. Some hacks can be resolved in days, while others can take weeks or months.\n\nThese are more than mere statistics. Real-world examples abound. In December, Yahoo! revealed the largest known security breach to date, which compromised over 1 billion accounts, only months after it reported a separate breach involving 500 million users. These intrusions could take years to resolve and cost millions of dollars.\n\nCybercrime is an epidemic; IBM's Watson has your back. Image source: Pixabay .\n\nIBM (NYSE: IBM) is rolling out a new weapon in cyberdefense: its Jeopardy! -winning cognitive supercomputer Watson. So how will a game show contestant help prevent hacking? Glad you asked, but first, a little background.\n\nOne of the technologies behind Watson is an artificial intelligence (AI) discipline known as deep learning. A software model of the brain is used to recreate our ability to learn. By using a massive number of examples, combined with sophisticated algorithms, the system learns to discover similarities among the examples and find differences. This results in the program mastering pattern recognition when reviewing large data sets.\n\nTeaching Watson about cybercrime\n\nIBM Watson is expanding its security protocol. Image source: Pixabay .\n\nIBM announced earlier this year that it was partnering with eight universities in a year-long research project to provide Watson with the requisite data necessary to expand its security protocol. These universities were chosen on the strength of their cybersecurity programs. According to an IBM press release in May, the system was \"learning the nuances of security research findings and discovering patterns and evidence of cyberattacks and threats that could otherwise be missed.\" Students and faculty input security data while Watson learned the peculiarities specific to cybersecurity. It planned to process up to 15,000 documents per month, building its database of threat intelligence reports, cybercrime strategies, and threat databases.\n\nAnd the work is paying off. IBM recently announced that 40 organizations are now part of the Watson Cyber Security beta program. This group hails from a wide array of industries including banking, healthcare, insurance, finance, travel, energy, automotive, and education. IBM hopes that by increasing participation in the beta program, Watson will, over time, evolve into the next generation of cyberdefense.\n\n\"By applying intelligent technologies like machine learning and natural language processing, Watson can help security analysts make better decisions from structured data, as well as the massive amount of unstructured data that has been dark to an organization's defenses until now,\" IBM wrote in its press release.\n\nBetter detectives\n\nMixing AI and cyber-security holds a lot of promise. MIT announced earlier this year that an AI system had achieved an 85% success rate at detecting threats. This system, called AI Squared, differed from previous attempts at using AI for cyberdefense. Rather than simply referring all anomalies to its human counterparts, this experiment provided feedback from the analyst to the system, allowing it to learn from the input provided by its human counterparts. This improved the system's assessments over time, increasing the accuracy of future predictions.\n\nThis reduced the number of both false positives and false negatives, according to MIT. This is a quantum leap forward versus earlier outlier detection, which merely looks for anomalies that are then forwarded to a human technician for further assessment. This video from MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory illustrates the process:\n\nLearning on their own\n\nGoogle neural networks created their own encryption! Image source: Pixabay\n\nIBM isn't the only player in this emerging field. While many big tech companies use varying degrees of artificial intelligence to help provide security for their cloud-computing operations, some are taking it to another level. In a research paper, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) division Google revealed that two neural networks had learned to build their own form of encryption, while a third was unable to crack that code. This is significant because they weren't taught about encryption or given any examples of encrypted and decrypted messages. Two neural networks were instructed to send communications to each other, and keep that information secret from the third. This is likely an early development toward a dynamic system that learns to protect itself. In its conclusion, the paper states: \"Finally, neural networks may be useful not only for cryptographic protections but also for attacks.\"\n\nWith its massive data centers and cloud infrastructure, this development could further enhance Google's business and advance its already impressive AI credentials.\n\nThe Foolish final word\n\nIBM has been leveraging Watson in a variety of ways. In adding cybersecurity to its resume, IBM hopes to capitalize on the inability of companies to keep pace with the growing threat posed by cybercrime. Sandy Bird, chief technology officer of IBM Security was quoted as saying in a press release:\n\nCustomers are in the early stages of implementing cognitive security technologies. Our research suggests this adoption will increase threefold over the next three years, as tools like Watson for Cyber Security mature and become pervasive in security operations centers. Currently, only seven percent of security professionals claim to be using cognitive solutions.\n\nIf Watson can capture just a portion of that threefold increase, its training has not been in vain.\n\n10 stocks we like better than IBM\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Throughout the year, Facebook continued to push video -- particularly live video -- investing millions of dollars in deals with celebrities, publishers, and creators.\n\nStill, for all the time users spend watching video, Facebook has struggled to monetize any of it directly. Creators are hesitant to publish videos to Facebook as they could be sacrificing potential earnings from YouTube -- the video-sharing website operating under Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google.\n\n\n\nFacebook's dedicated video section. Image source: Facebook.\n\nFacebook's latest attempt, according to a report from Recode , is mid-roll ads that will play in longer videos (at least 90 seconds). Facebook will split revenue with creators 55-45 in favor of creators, the same split as YouTube.\n\nMonetizing video is one of Facebook's biggest opportunities, and mid-roll video ads would represent its most promising effort yet.\n\nVideo advertising for everyone\n\nFacebook has made several attempts to monetize video views directly. It tried post-roll video ads when it showed highlights of the NFL a couple of years ago. It tried inserting ads between videos in its dedicated video section on mobile, but many publishers were upset that revenue was split based on watchtime.\n\nLast year, Facebook started letting publishers work directly with sponsors to monetize their videos, but Facebook didn't take a cut. It also started experimenting with mid-roll ads in live videos for specific publishers, splitting the ad revenue with them\n\nApparently, those mid-roll video ad tests were good enough to roll out the feature to more users. Recode says publishers will be able to insert ads into their pre-recorded videos as long as the videos are at least 90 seconds long. The ads must play after at least 20 seconds of organic video watch time.\n\nThe format is long enough for savvy creators to grab viewers' attention, set up a reason to stay tuned, and transition to the advertisement. While it doesn't provide the benefit of forcing users to watch ads like the pre-roll format on YouTube, creators could see a larger percentage of users actually sit through the complete ad on Facebook if they do a good job creating the video and enticing users to stay tuned. A recent survey from LaunchLeap found that just 29% of U.S. Millennials watch YouTube ads to completion.\n\nAn incremental opportunity\n\nThe important thing to note is that inserting ads mid-roll into videos represents an incremental opportunity for Facebook. CFO Dave Wehner warned analysts that ad revenue growth will \"come down meaningfully\" by the middle of this year due to ad load constraints. If the new ads work, it provides another avenue for Facebook to sneak ads into users' feeds.\n\nYouTube generated an estimated $12 billion in revenue in 2016. Following Facebook's disclosure of 100 million hours of video watchtime per day, YouTube made a point of pointing out its users watch \"hundreds of millions\" of hours of video every day.\n\nEven if Facebook users still watch less video than on YouTube, the Google subsidiary represents the potential for inserting ads into Facebook videos. For reference, Facebook generated $24.7 billion in revenue over the last 12 months.\n\nOne small negative\n\nThere is one small negative impact of mid-roll video ads. The new revenue sharing agreement would significantly reduce Facebook's operating margin on those ad units. So far, Facebook has largely benefited from what is essentially free content. It posted an operating margin of 45% in the third quarter, significantly higher than Alphabet's 25% operating margin.\n\nThere's also the possibility that mid-roll ads could cannibalize some of Facebook's stand-alone video ads. That would amplify the negative impact on Facebook's margins. On the other hand, it would mean more creators are opting to use mid-roll ads, which likely means higher-quality videos on Facebook and more user engagement. That ought to more than offset the negative impact on margins.\n\nThe growth of video on Facebook is great, and it has led to more user engagement. Unless Facebook can find a way to directly monetize those video views, however, that engagement isn't worth much. Mid-roll ads are the most promising effort yet, and they could lead to continued strong revenue growth at Facebook.\n\nFind out why Facebook is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\n\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

(NASDAQ: AMZN ) had a fabulous Consumer Electronics Show. According to InvestorPlace contributor Brad Moon, Alexa was the big winner of CES 2017 - an event the company didn't even have its own booth at. The company's Alexa voice assistant could eventually become an operating system , showing up last week in refrigerators, cars and robots. But what kind of affect does this have on AMZN stock?\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmazon's ability to get its assistant supported by hardware contrasted with the failures of Siri from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Cortana from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and Google Assistant from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ).\n\nAmazon did it, first, by delivering the assistant to millions through its Echo speakers and, second, by allowing it to run on the cheapest imaginable hardware, focusing instead on the cloud-based Alexa Voice Service API. Rivals sought to use their voice assistants to tie hardware to their higher-end ecosystems, and they are unlikely to show much for consumer markets before next year.\n\nAMZN stock had fallen from a high of nearly $850 per share in October to a post-election low of barely $720. To many investors that is starting to look like yet-another missed opportunity to get in.\n\nSpectacular Whispers\n\nThe \"whisper number\" on Amazon's Christmas-season earnings have become outrageous. The latest is for earnings of $1.43 per share on revenues of $44.70 billion. Last Christmas, by contrast, Amazon did $1.00 per share of earnings on revenues of $35.747 billion and, after another one of those discouraging falls (this time to near $500), rose steadily to that near-$850 high.\n\nIf AMZN stock matches expectations, you're talking about top-line growth of 25% and earnings growth of 43%, year-over-year. You're still talking about paying nearly three times sale for a retailer, when successful merchants like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT ) get just 40 cents of equity for each dollar of sales, but Amazon is no longer a retailer.\n\nSince then, of course, AMZN has become a major TV studio, with the Golden Globes to prove it. In addition to its $100 per year Prime shipping plan, which includes the video offerings and ties customers to the shopping service with free shipping, Amazon has added $10-per-month plans for music and eBooks - I've lately found the Kindle Unlimited offering to be outstanding.\n\nIts Amazon Web Services cloud is practically an industry standard, and its most recent report showed it growing 55% per year, to a run rate of over $11 billion , with high profitability. If Alexa is becoming an operating system, akin to Windows, Android and Apple's iOS, many will consider it highly undervalued.\n\nThe Bear Case for AMZN Stock\n\nEvery story like this must include a bear case for the stock.\n\nBack in 2012, when I first started accumulating shares at about $330 each, bears claimed that Amazon didn't make any money, that it was a \"Ponzi scheme\" and, essentially, an over-priced merchandiser.\n\nJust last week, InvestorPlace contributor Chris Tyler wrote that the technicals were bad, that the data collected by the Echo may become subject to judicial review and that the incoming Administration doesn't like the company.\n\nScams are proliferating on the service and one long-time Amazon bull, Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities, told his followers to dump AMZN stock late last year, saying cloud growth catalysts are gone .\n\nI'm Not Selling Amazon Stock\n\nI disagree. AMZN stock has become like Apple, a stock you buy when you can and hold onto. I have more than doubled my money on Amazon stock since 2013, and while it's becoming an uncomfortably large part of my retirement account, I'm going to own it for the long haul.\n\nWe are still in the early innings of the cloud revolution, voice operating systems are brand-new and the disruption of cable by internet offerings like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Amazon Prime has really just begun.\n\nAMZN remains hungry, entering the activewear market under its own brand, private labels in food and geography-specific offerings like a move into India's big market for second-hand goods.\n\nEven at its present sales level, Amazon is still less than one-third as large as Walmart, with better penetration of international markets and now it is a true player in the \"great game\" of technology industry leadership.\n\nIf I weren't stuffed with AMZN stock (no retirement account should have all its eggs in one basket) I'd be buying more. And that may be the key caution I can offer. When everyone is this bullish, listen to the bear.\n\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

(AMZN) Stock to $1,000? appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Driverless-car stocks are revving up for a record-breaking year. If you're on the hunt for a pure play on the trend, though, you're out of luck. There are essentially no publicly traded companies dealing exclusively in driverless cars. But at The Motley Fool, we're always on the lookout for creative investment angles. Here are three driverless-car stocks that let you invest in the technology, the car , and the data for the driverless-car revolution.\n\n1. MobilEye -- The technology\n\nMobilEye Co-Founder and CTO Amnon Shashua. Image source: BMW.\n\nJerusalem-based MobilEye (NYSE: MBLY) is as pure a play as they come for driverless-car stocks. It manufactures the cameras for advanced driver assistance systems in approximately 220 car models. In July, MobilEye announced a partnership with BMW and Intel to develop an autonomous-vehicle platform by 2021. Just a month later, it went even further when it announced a partnership with auto supplier Delphi Automotive to develop a \"plug-and-play\" self-driving platform available for any automaker to adopt by 2017.\n\nMobilEye seems to be poised for profit -- it just announced a 34% year-over-year quarterly revenue increase and prides itself on an asset-light business model. For investors, this signals both a buying opportunity and a valuation warning. Its stock jumped 27% after the recent news and has wavered back and forth over the past few years alongside industry-level bullishness and stock-specific announcements. Investors in MobilEye should be bullish on the commoditization of driverless technology and have a long-term perspective to weather the ups and downs that will probably continue.\n\nMBLY data by YCharts .\n\n2. Tesla Motors -- The car\n\nImage source: Tesla Motors.\n\nTesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) is not a driverless-car stock, but it is vehement in its belief that automation is the automotive future. All its vehicles come equipped with Autopilot, a technology that Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk says will allow Teslas to drive themselves across the country by (hopefully) 2018. As a first major adopter of semi-autonomous driving, Tesla has experienced setbacks, most notably a driver fatality last May.\n\nA Tesla Motors stock investment allows investors to get behind the wheel of an already-scaling semi-driverless carl , something that no other company can offer. But Tesla is also much more than a driverless-car stock. The company is, first and foremost, a (driver-filled) car company. Its recent $2 billion merger with SolarCity also makes it a solar company, an industry with substantial regulatory unknowns of its own. The company is betting on significant synergies by packaging solar rooftops with car sales, but these major moves have kept many investors on the fence about its future. For Tesla to make the driverless-car stock list, investors need to be sure they're bullish on its entire business.\n\n3. Alphabet -- The data\n\nVideo source: Waymo via Youtube .\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , the parent company of Google, has been making major moves in the driverless-car space. The company has spent more than $60 million to bump humans out of the driver's seat, and last October, it announced that it had clocked a whopping 2 million road miles on its autonomous vehicles. Last month, Alphabet went a step further by redefining its automation efforts as a full-fledged spinoff business dubbed Waymo, rather than one of its prototype \"moonshot\" projects.\n\nAlphabet and Waymo have made clear that they're not interested in car manufacturing, a hat tip to others such as BMW that are already well entrenched in this space. Instead, it will focus on taking what it's learned from its cute \"panda car\" prototypes and transferring it to commercial cars, such as the 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans that are set to join Waymo's fleet in early 2017. Waymo has a strong technological advantage over many competitors, but where it truly shines is its access to and refinement of data. Self-driving cars risk being aimless wanderers without enough information about their surroundings, and Alphabet has more information about the world than anyone else, and is continuing to learn how best to use it in the quest for an autonomous vehicle.\n\nWith an Alphabet investment, investors need to understand that driverless cars are not one slice of this company's pie -- they're a crumb. With Alphabet's $550 billion market cap, Waymo's minuscule $60 million fleet of pandas and minivans is not what this company's counting on to drive profits in the years to come. But Waymo is yet another example of how Alphabet is capitalizing on its core competitive advantage in ways that were not previously expected -- and if that's what you're interested in investing in, then Alphabet may be the driverless-car stock for you.\n\nPedal to the metal?\n\nWith driverless-car technology still in its infancy, it can be tempting to take a backseat to investing in this industry. But for risk-tolerant investors with a long-term perspective, getting in on the ground floor of a driverless-car stock might be the best way to snag major returns in the years to come, whether it's by investing in the technology, the car , or the data.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSince 2012, automotive-industry disrupter Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) has raised roughly $6.5 billion from investors to support its audacious ambitions.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSo far, Tesla stock has accumulated losses in the billions from the capital it's raised. But as you may well know, past performance has little to do with what might happen in the future.\n\nAlso, in its current full year (2015 to 2016 results have yet to be finalized) of operations, Tesla reported a loss of $888 million and spent $1.6 billion to develop new factories and manufacturing capabilities, including a pioneering \"gigafactory\" to churn out scores of lithium batteries for its automobiles and burgeoning solar operations.\n\nTesla also issued more than $300 million in debt and sold another $730 million in stock. Revolutionizing industries is not a cheap undertaking.\n\nThings got more interesting in July when Tesla announced it would purchase SolarCity. Investors approved the deal and SolarCity was folded into the corporate fold. The term \"clean energy empire\" has been mentioned, with potential synergies of using Tesla's batteries to store energy produced from solar panels on the top of consumer roofs. Clean energy is the all-around goal.\n\nTesla's Auto Ambitions\n\nOf course, Tesla has huge plans and first intends to revolutionize the automotive industry. In many respects, it is just getting warmed up as a company. Its fourth-quarter net orders for new cars (its Model S and Model X) jumped 52%. Vehicle production increased an impressive 64% to nearly 84,000 vehicles for all of 2016.\n\nScale is key for Tesla's vehicle operations. It will improve car reliability and lower warranty costs because of manufacturing efficiencies. Growth also provides operating leverage. More sales help offset fixed costs in factories, showrooms and everything that goes with building a car company from the ground up. Management likes to highlight a steady improvement in gross margins to illustrate the benefits of its growing scale.\n\nThe Solar and Autonomous Auto Wildcards\n\nThe same goes for SolarCity. Elon Musk, who effectively controlled both Tesla and SolarCity before they merged, spoke to creating a solar roof product for homes. Manufacturing scale also benefits the production of solar panels and distributing throughout the country. High-efficiency cells at a low cost is the goal in this part of the business.\n\nTesla also has big plans for self-driving cars. Other players in the space include the venture capital unit of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ,NASDAQ: GOOGL ), and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ), who builds chips to support autonomous vehicle capabilities.\n\nIs Tesla Too Ambitious?\n\nThere is certainly an argument to be made that Tesla is too ambitious. Musk has spoken about producing a million cars by 2020, and its gigafactory is said to cost as much as $5 billion, though other partners and suppliers will share in the expense.\n\nSolarCity is thought to be cash flow neutral when it is officially folded in during the last quarter of 2016. However, it did add more debt to the capital structure.\n\nAnalysts are projecting earnings losses for 2016 and 2017. This year, they estimate a loss of $2.15, but a significant improvement to a loss of only 73 cents for all of 2017.\n\nThose that are offering an investment opinion overwhelmingly believe the stock is a \"hold\" (versus a sell or buy) right now.\n\nThere is little denying the investment uncertainty is high for Tesla stock. There are many moving parts, and there isn't much current visibility on positive profit or cash flow production. In fact, there are likely to be many more years of aggressive spending and investment to scale the car and solar operations.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Tesla Stock\n\nThe market capitalization for Tesla stock currently sits around $37 billion. That seems a rather high number for a company generating only about $6 billion in annual sales and nothing to speak of in terms of profits.\n\nAn investment in Tesla stock is really a call on Elon Musk's ambitions and his vision of creating a truly revolutionary automotive and energy firm. Certainly, energy stored via batteries has many benefits over current technologies supported by gas and other fossil fuels to create energy.\n\nStoring energy through batteries has huge potential ramifications for the global energy sector, and helping scale that development via a giant gigafactory in the Nevada desert could turn out truly revolutionary.\n\nBut investing in the potential is another story.\n\nTo me, it seems too risky to hope that sales and profits come flowing in within a decade. There will likely be many ups and downs, with many chances for investors to buy in with more certainty down the road.\n\nUntil then, they might want to consider stodgy General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ), which has a reasonable valuation and high dividend yield. It won't benefit from the growth in consumer solar panels, but stands a good chance at participating in the electric and autonomous automobile markets that Tesla is paving a new path in.\n\nAs of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is a \"Hold\" at Best appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe 2017 Consumer Electronics Show may have wound down, but the rumors around it certainly haven't. The latest is centered on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), a company that wasn't even at CES 2017. A well-known technology blogger is convinced he uncovered a partnership between AAPL and German optical company Carl Zeiss AG to develop Apple AR glasses. And he thinks they'll be released in 2017.\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nThe new rumor about Apple AR glasses started when technology blogger Robert Scoble wrote a post on Facebook. In it, he laid out a series of clues that led him to conclude that something is up between Apple and Carl Zeiss AG.\n\nCES 2017, Carl Zeiss AG and Augmented Reality\n\nHe started with a photo showing Carl Zeiss AG clearly had a booth located in the Augmented Reality section of CES 2017. However, the company had no AR technology on display, which was odd. Scoble approached the staff operating the booth and asked them if the lack of product was because Tim Cook had refused to allow them to show it and got a nervous reaction that seemed to confirm his suspicions. He went on to write:\n\n\"A Zeiss employee confirmed the rumors that Apple and Carl Zeiss AG are working on a light pair of augmented reality/mixed reality glasses that may be announced this year.\"\n\nIf Scoble is correct in his prediction, AAPL could be adding Apple AR glasses to a big product release year that includes a 10th anniversary iPhone 8.\n\nApple AR Glasses Are Far From a Long Shot\n\nWhat Scoble wrote is a rumor. It's based on deductions and conversation with an un-named Carl Zeiss AG employee, so it's far from fact. However, it's not as far-fetched as it may sound.\n\nThere have been rumblings over the past few months that AAPL is developing its own Apple AR glasses . Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) may have stumbled with its Google Glass version, but that doesn't mean augmented reality glasses are dead in the water.\n\nThe AR field had a good year in 2016 - think games like Pokémon Go - and Snap, Inc. released its inexpensive Snapchat Spectacles later in the year. Both have been very popular and show that AR is likely to hit the mainstream before virtual reality does.\n\nAAPL has already publicly supported the concept of augmented reality multiple times in recent months. In a July earnings meeting, CEO Tim Cook said :\n\n\"AR can be really great. We have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We're high on AR in the long run and we think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.\"\n\nAnd in September, Cook was quoted by Business Insider as saying:\n\n\"There's virtual reality and there's augmented reality - both of these are incredibly interesting. But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far.\"\n\nClearly, Cook has been giving more than passing thought to augmented reality and in the quest to create a new, high-demand product line, Apple AR glasses could fit the bill. Carl Zeiss AG is a highly respected German company specializing in optical technology, so in terms of a partnership that makes perfect sense.\n\nGoogle Glass may have failed to crack the augmented reality market, but it gave AAPL the opportunity to do what it does best: Learn from a rival's mistakes and come back with its own version that nails it.\n\nApple AR glasses seem more likely than ever to be the next big new thing from AAPL and if Robert Scoble is right, they could be arriving as soon as this year.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Developing AR Glasses with Carl Zeiss? appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt's bad form to gloat. Apart from making you insufferable to be around at parties, you're tempting fate … and inviting a reversal of fortune.\n\nThat said, I'm going to risk it and toot my own horn here for a moment. I've had a good string of successes in InvestorPlace's annual Best Stocks contest. I took the top prize in 2011, the very first year of the contest, when my pick - credit card behemoth Visa Inc (NYSE: V ) - racked up a 34% return.\n\nI followed that up in 2012 with a strong performance by Turkish mobile operator Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri A.S. (ADR) (NYSE: TKC ), just barely missing the top slot with a 37% return . And I reclaimed my crown in 2013 when German luxury automaker Daimler AG (OTCMKTS: DDAIF ) rolled to victory with a 65% return .\n\nAlas, you can't win them all. My 2014 pick, South African mobile operator MTN Group Ltd (ADR) (OTCMKTS: MTNOY ) finished in last place, losing 6% . And my 2015 pick, business development company Prospect Capital Corporation (NASDAQ: PSEC ) finished in the middle of the pack, losing a modest 4% .\n\nWell, in 2016, I got my groove back, winning InvestorPlace's Best Stock for 2016 contest with a 55% return in Energy Transfer Equity LP (NYSE: ETE ). Over the six years of the contest, my picks have returned an average of 30%. Not too shabby. Taking the top spot in 3 out of 6 years and coming in a close second in a fourth… I'll take that!\n\nIn 2017, I chose General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ), which is thus far off to a respectable start (see General Motors Will Roll to Victory ). May the best stock win!\n\nI'm the first to admit that there is a lot of luck involved with winning a contest like this. Holding a single stock for exactly one calendar year is not how investors invest in the real world. And had the contests started on some other arbitrary date - say, Jan. 31 as opposed to Dec. 31 - then the returns across the board would look a lot different. So luck was definitely on my side with respect to the exact timing.\n\nYet all of my picks did have one thing in common: All were contrarian plays that no one else wanted at the time.\n\nLet's take Energy Transfer Equity as an example. Right now, shares are riding high on optimism that the incoming Donald Trump administration will be friendlier to pipeline operators. The Barack Obama administration has been openly hostile, with their halting of ETE's Dakota Access Pipeline being a prime example. The change in the White House has investors looking at this entire sector in a more positive light.\n\nBut think back to this time last year. The prices of oil and gas were crashing, and rival pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE: KMI ) had just cut its dividend, leaving investors to wonder who might be next to slash their payout. ETE's sister companies weren't looking especially healthy, and Energy Transfer Equity was embroiled in a controversial takeover bid of Williams Companies Inc (NYSE: WMB ). Before the selloff was finished, ETE would drop by just shy of 90%.\n\nWhile terrifying, these are the moments that value investors live for. If you do your homework, you can have confidence that your pick will come out of the selloff in one piece.\n\nLet's consider ETE for a moment. Given the turbulence in the credit market that was making it hard for the company to raise capital, I knew there was a good chance it might have to slash its distribution or, at a minimum, stop growing it at the blistering 30% annual rate that we'd become accustomed to seeing. But I also knew that ETE's empire had real, tangible assets in its pipeline network that would put a floor under the stock price and ensure its survival as a company.\n\nI also knew that Dallas billionaire Kelcy Warren - the founder and CEO of Energy Transfer - had a substantial part of his entire fortune tied up in ETE stock, so the person running the company had every incentive to do whatever it took to make it survive. Mr. Warren had a lot more at risk than I did.\n\nObviously, none of this guaranteed I would win the Best Stocks contest, but it definitely put me in position to do well. And when crude oil prices found a bottom and the credit markets settled down, ETE started its epic run.\n\nI'm still long Energy Transfer Equity, and I expect it to rise another 50% to 100% over the next two to three years. But let's now take a quick look at General Motors, my pick for the Best Stocks for 2017.\n\nGeneral Motors is not in the midst of an industry-wide meltdown like Energy Transfer Equity was a year ago. But I can credibly say that GM, like ETE, is a cheap stock that no one wanted. As I'm writing this, General Motors trades for an almost ridiculous 6 times earnings and 0.34 times sales. It seems that the market expects GM's sales to massively slow down in the years ahead. And to be fair, with ride sharing services like Uber and the promise of driverless cars on the horizon, handicapping GM's future prospects is a challenge.\n\nBut at current prices, a lot of bad news is already priced in. GM doesn't have to have record year of auto sales in order for the stock to do well. It simply needs to avoid blowing up, and I consider that a safe bet.\n\nWill that be enough to push GM into the top spot in 2017? Only time will tell, but I like my chances.\n\nCharles Sizemore is the principal of Sizemore Capital Management , an investments firm based in Dallas, Texas.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) on smart cars, but INTC clearly wants to find its niche in the mix before this trend really takes off.\n\nThe major piece of news is that Intel is buying 15% of mapping startup company Here from a consortium of German carmakers, including BMW (OTCMKTS: BMWYY ) . The Germans paid $3.1 billion to buy Here a year ago, so I have a hunch that that the car companies are flipping for a profit and INTC is paying a premium.\n\nBut that's okay for two reasons.\n\nWhy Buying Here Is Good for INTC Stock\n\nFirst, the market took INTC's decision to commit $250 million to autonomous cars back in November as a bit of a joke.\n\nIn a world where AAPL can blithely spend $1 billion to buy into a Chinese fleet management company and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) has probably blown at least that much cash getting its cars on the road, the initial ante from INTC looked relatively unimpressive.\n\nYou've got to be serious about this market as it emerges and companies pick their partners. Spending this much money on Here proves INTC is very serious and creates a space for its hardware under the hood of some of the world's leading car brands - including BMW, which will be testing self-driving systems powered by INTC in its prototype cars late this year.\n\nSecond, this is more than just another copycat mapping system; this is the platform originally pioneered for Nokia Corp (ADR) (NYSE: NOK ) phones, which a lot of people still consider superior to anything that's hit Android or iOS mobile devices. Buying a piece of Here guarantees that INTC will be relevant to any discussion around how cars, drones and everything else navigates across the Internet of Things.\n\nThis is a company that routinely books $22 billion a year in Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), cash flow it needs to reinvest in its future in order to keep tech funds happy.\n\nBut unlike a lot of moon shots coming out of Silicon Valley, this bet can actually make an impact on INTC's ultimate bottom line.\n\nBottom Line for INTC\n\nThe latest forecast indicates that vehicle automation might unlock $34 billion a year in the very near future. All of those cars may not have INTC technology inside, but even a 10% slice of that global opportunity can still double the company's currently anemic growth rate.\n\nAt the end of the day, that's what I and other investors want to see from events like CES: Not \"concept\" products that will never see real commercial deployment.\n\nSmart cars are a real boom revving up. And in this race to the market, INTC now has a guaranteed place in the pit crew.\n\nHilary Kramer is the editor of GameChangers , Breakout Stocks Under $10 , High Octane Trader , Absolute Capital Return and Value Authority .

The move is to comply with a court decision in November that directed all personal data of Russian citizens to be housed in servers located in Russia.\n\nAs per the directions from the Russian government, Google and Apple have removed the access to the Linked in App.\n\nThe Government has been pointing to security issues and leakage of personal data to implement the data storage law. The law permits authorities to blacklist companies or to block services within the country.\n\nRecently, the U.S. officials accused that Russia has tried to influence the recently concluded Presidential elections in U.S. The U.S. presume that Russian Intelligence agencies have accessed and maintained access to multiples of U.S. State and local electoral boards.\n\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\n\nhttp://www.rttnews.com\n\nThis article appears in: News Headlines", "Image source: Getty.\n\nAmazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) always seems to be ahead of the curve, but in recent weeks the company has made a tidal wave of advances showing off the strides it's made.\n\nIn December, it unveiled the first Amazon Go location, a convenience store without cashiers or checkout lines where cameras and artificial intelligence recognize what you take off the shelves and charge your account accordingly.\n\nAlso last month, the company successfully made its first ever drone delivery, carrying popcorn and a Fire TV device to a customer in rural England, a trip from click to delivery that took just 13 minutes.\n\nLast week, reports emerged than Amazon was planning to launch its own private label athleisure line, challenging Lululemon athletica and other such clothing makers as it takes further steps into the apparel industry.\n\n\n\nand other such clothing makers as it takes further steps into the apparel industry. Amazon gained a patent for something resembling an airborne warehouse that would serve as a docking station for drones. The warehouse, envisioned as something like a blimp, would be able to move near events such as sports games, where it could make drone deliveries to fans.\n\nOf all of Amazon's innovations, the airborne warehouse and the system of drones to go with it seems to be the most fantastical. The tech giant envisions the blimp hovering at an altitude of 45,000 feet, from which the drones could make deliveries of game-related merchandise or food. Amazon has filed hundreds of patents in its history, and just because it's patented such an airborne fulfillment center doesn't mean it will become reality. However, Amazon is committed to making drone delivery a core component of its business.\n\nTaking over the skies\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos went on 60 Minutes in December of 2013 to show off his company's Prime Air program, or what it calls drone delivery. Though it took more than three years since then for the first delivery to happen, the company has taken significant steps toward a future based on drones.\n\nAmazon envisions a world where most of its deliveries take place via drone. Its current fleet can handle packages of up to five pounds, which accounts for 80-90% of its shipments. According to Deutsche Bank , widespread drone delivery could cut the cost of retail goods by as much as half, dramatically transforming the retail industry as it could eliminate the need for most stores.\n\nAs Amazon recently demonstrated, it's capable of performing drone deliveries, but regulatory hurdles still stand in the way in much of the world. The company has had success before in bending government rules, convincing the US Postal Service to deliver its packages on Sunday and persuading the Federal Aviation Administration to allow use of electronic gadgets like Kindles end-to-end on flights.\n\nNow, Amazon is again hammering out new rules with the FAA, but thus far the agency has not permitted such unmanned deliveries. Under current stipulations, drones must remain within view of the pilot, making delivery currently unfeasible.\n\nThat explains why Amazon has focused on the UK and other countries such as Australia and France for its initial testing.\n\nAmazon isn't the only company focused on drones. Rivals, including Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Wal-Mart , have been investing in the aerial technology as well. Wal-Mart is testing drones to assist with inventory at its warehouses, using the flying machines to track and manage merchandise. It's a move bankruptcy attorney Isaac Marcushamer, who studies industry disruption, said is one of many move designed to keep pace with Amazon, much like its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's own drone initiative, Project Wing, hit some roadblocks recently as two executives left the division and Starbucks pulled out of a food delivery test. Alphabet aims to create a food delivery marketplace where customers can order delivery by drone from the likes of Domino's Pizza or Chipotle for $6.\n\nWith Amazon Go, Alexa, AWS, and other innovations, Amazon has a track record like no other company in innovating new business and using them for competitive advantage. It's the company that stands to gain the most from drone delivery and has put the biggest effort into it, so it's therefore likely to be the leader in the future.\n\nIndustry insiders say regulations are the biggest obstacle right now, and envision drone deliveries becoming commonplace in five or ten years. While we may never see an airborne blimp as a delivery hub, the momentum in drone delivery is fast gaining speed. Pretty soon, it may be inevitable.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon.com\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .", "Image source: John Legere's social media account.\n\nCES 2017 is now winding down, but last week T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) CEO John Legere held a press conference at the annual tech extravaganza. In it, Legere made eight bold predictions of what the telecommunications industry might have in store for 2017, and also subsequently penned a blog post on T-Mobile's site.\n\nLet's go through Legere's calls and see what they could mean for investors.\n\n1. No more cable company MVNOs\n\nMobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which buy wholesale capacity from the major network operators and resell service under a different brand, have always occupied a tenuous place within the mobile value chain. Facing sluggish landline growth, many cable companies have looked toward establishing MVNOs for some exposure to wireless growth. For instance, Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) announced plans late last year that it would launch an MVNO on Verizon 's(NYSE: VZ) network in 2017, supplemented by Wi-Fi hotspots.\n\nLegere doesn't think these MVNO ambitions will play out well for anyone, and the Un-carrier will not ink any MVNO agreements with cable operators.\n\n2. Google goes big\n\nThere are a few candidates for tech giants that may look to jump into the wireless sector, but Legere thinks Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google is the most obvious pick. Of course, the search giant launched Project Fi in 2015, which is a sort of hybrid MVNO that uses several networks (including T-Mobile's) in conjunction with Wi-Fi hotspots. Google is experimenting with and pioneering several interesting ideas, such as prorated data fees.\n\nThus far, Project Fi has been limited to a small number of devices, mostly Nexus and Pixel phones, but Google has the groundwork in place if it wants to make a bigger impact.\n\n3. TV goes (more) mobile\n\nOver-the-top (OTT) streaming services are proliferating in lockstep with cord-cutting, and Legere sees the shift to mobile accelerating. The chief executive notes that a third of TV watching occurs on devices other than TVs. By the end of 2017, he believes that the majority of TV viewing will be delivered via mobile.\n\nRoughly 61% of mobile traffic is video, and this should jump to 77% by 2020, according to CTIA. T-Mobile delivers quite a bit of (downscaled) video for free via its Binge On program, so it only benefits financially from this increased usage if consumers pay extra for high-resolution streams or opt out of Binge On.\n\n4. Say goodbye to DISH\n\nDISH Network has been sitting on unused spectrum for years, fueling speculation that it would jump into the wireless world. Legere is calling for \"the end of DISH as we know it\" this year, saying it will cease to be a stand-alone entity. DISH's TV business has been on the decline, also a victim of cord-cutting, for quite some time. The company lost 116,000 net TV subscribers last quarter, and currently has about 13.6 million subscribers left.\n\n5. Ridiculously fast LTE\n\nT-Mobile recently noted that it is already approaching gigabit LTE speeds, thanks to its ongoing investments in spectrum and LTE infrastructure. Other carriers are hoping for gigabit speeds on 5G, but Legere says T-Mobile will be there first using existing technologies. Of course, hitting peak theoretical speeds is quite different than what average consumers experience, and most users won't see gigabit speeds in real-world performance anytime soon. T-Mobile reached 979 Mbps in its labs, using a combination of technologies and an unreleased handset.\n\n6. More people will watch him cook\n\nLegere hosts a live-streamed video segment on social media every Sunday under #SlowCookerSunday. Currently, about 500,000 viewers tune in to watch him cook each week, and he predicts he'll have 1 million weekly viewers by the end of 2017. Legere uses his segment as an example of the rise of OTT content, which continues to threaten cable channels.\n\n7. C-suite shakeups\n\nThis is a pretty bold one, but Legere predicts that three of the four CEOs of the current major wireless operators will be out by year's end. That's an ambitious forecast not only because that's a lot of CEOs losing their jobs, but also because of the ongoing consolidation speculation that T-Mobile isn't exactly downplaying . If T-Mobile ends up merging with Sprint , Legere would immediately score at least one point on this one.\n\n8. Speculating on speculation\n\nPointing to the deterioration in both Verizon's and Comcast's core businesses, Legere says that the two telecom giants will be \"forced\" to entertain the idea of a blockbuster megamerger that would combine \"two of the most hated brands in America.\" Note that Legere doesn't believe a deal will be officially announced or closed, but rather the pair would have \"discussions.\" Seeing as how discussions of this nature often leak and spur speculation, Legere is essentially speculating on speculation. In fairness, the idea isn't out of the question altogether, given AT&T 's recent moves.\n\n10 stocks we like better than T-Mobile US\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Case in point is Nikola Tesla. The innovative scientist - from whom Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) gets its name - was on a path toward inventing a free global power generator when he discovered the \"Tesla coil.\"\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThis system was the first one where electricity could be transmitted wirelessly . Although Tesla never achieved his dream of providing free energy, his groundbreaking work set the stage for today's technologies.\n\nIndeed, while Wall Street has clamored over Tesla stock in recent years, many would be surprised to learn that TSLA did not invent the electric vehicle. In fact, the very first EV was developed well before TSLA CEO Elon Musk - or even his parents - were born. The first crude prototypes were introduced during the early nineteenth century. However, it wasn't until the 1890s that the EV entered its original heyday.\n\nThe Backdrop of Tesla stock\n\nIn 1893, electric-powered cars were exhibited in Chicago. Four years later, electric taxis were ferrying people around busy New York City streets. By the dawn of the twentieth century, EVs were actually on the verge of automotive domination. In 1900, a whopping 28% of automobiles were powered by electricity. A year earlier, Thomas Edison of General Electric Company (NYSE: GE ) fame began a massive investment into EV battery technologies.\n\nOf course, it was Henry Ford and the eventual Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) that killed the EV's momentum. Mass production of the iconic Model T offered the public practical transportation at a substantial discount to its electric counterparts. As further advancements made gasoline-powered cars increasingly convenient, the EV platform was quickly abandoned, and not to be revisited seriously until TSLA entered the scene.\n\nThe eventual success of Tesla stock resulted from a primary vulnerability of fossil-fueled autos - dependence on crude oil. That not only drew the ire of price-gouged drivers, it also directly shed human blood. World wars have been fought over oil . And it's absolutely no conspiracy to say that much of our foreign policy is centered on \"black gold.\"\n\nI'm not suggesting that Tesla stock is some kind of philanthropic investment. Rather, TSLA is an investment in the future that has been a long-time coming. Anybody that's anybody - Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , GOOGL ), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Amazon.com, Inc . (NASDAQ: AMZN ) - are all gearing up aggressively for digitization and \"next-gen\" computing. To assume that our transportation mechanisms will continue to be tethered to archaic fossil fuels is to believe in the flat earth.\n\nI would go so far as to say that the bear case for Tesla stock should only be limited to a clearly defined framework. Otherwise, TSLA is one of the few investments I confidently trust.\n\nFears Surrounding Tesla's Viability\n\nThat's not to say that Tesla isn't without faults. From a gut reaction, shares are pricey. After all, Tesla stock was trading for around $30 a pop four years ago. At well over $200 today, that's a big percentage and psychological jump. Naturally, investors will question whether they've missed the boat.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge Drawing up a long-term technical chart of Tesla stock does not help matters. When assessing the publicly traded history of TSLA stock, you can't help but notice a sharp resemblance to the business S-curve .\n\nIn short, the S-curve is a graphical representation of the three main phases of a business or industry - infancy, expansion and maturity. The concern here is that Tesla stock has gone through an accelerated version of the S-curve, and is now sitting in the maturity phase.\n\nAdding to those fears are the financials. Let's be honest - they don't look great. Free cash flow is always running in the red, profitability margins are stressed and Tesla stock is overvalued against forward earnings. Short interest for TSLA stock has also increased significantly since the second-half of this year.\n\nFinally, as awesome as these folks are, they're not immune to making dumb mistakes . The buyout of SolarCity is an embarrassing example.\n\nMoving Forward With Tesla Stock\n\nListen - Tesla stock isn't for everybody. But I'd like to leave you with this last statistic. Presently, everyone is talking about the EV revolution - which TSLA helped catapult - as if it's unprecedented. Yet the market penetration for EVs is only 3%. The mass excitement centers around forecasts calling for 7% penetration by the year 2020.\n\nThat's nice, but that's just scratching the surface. Assuming the forecast is accurate, that's only a quarter of what was achieved in 1900. With technology advancing at a clip rate, it's more likely than not that TSLA will end up on the right side of history.\n\nThe bottom line here is to not let the bumps in the road dissuade you from Tesla stock. It's risky, it's pricey, but it has all the right components working in its favor.\n\nAs of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Is Risky, Pricey and Absolutely Right appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is set to report results for its fourth quarter of 2016 on Thursday, Jan. 26. Before the numbers for the quarter are released, here's a broad overview of some areas to watch.\n\nGoogle offices. Image souce: Google.\n\nRevenue and EPS\n\nThe pressure is certainly on for Alphabet's fourth quarter, especially after the company's expectation-beating quarter before it. For Alphabet's third quarter, both the company's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) exceeded expectations. Revenue and non-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting principles) EPS was $22.5 billion and $9.06, respectively, up significantly from $18.7 billion and $7.35, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, on average, expected third-quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $22.1 billion and $8.63.\n\nGoing into Alphabet's fourth quarter, analysts expect robust growth to continue, albeit not as sharply. On average, analysts expect fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $25.1 billion and $9.63, up 18% and 11%, respectively, year over year.\n\nMetric Q3 YOY Growth Q3 YOY Growth Implied by Consensus Analyst Estimate Revenue 20% 18% Non-GAAP EPS 23% 11%\n\nThere's merit to analysts' conservatism, particularly since Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat went out of her way during the company's third-quarter earnings call to remind analysts that the company will be up against tough year-ago revenue comparisons in the fourth quarter.\n\nPaid clicks and cost-per-clicks\n\nOne of the reasons why Alphabet outperformed expectations in Q3 was because of its big increase in paid clicks, or the total number of clicks for which advertisers paid Google. Aggregate paid clicks in Q3 were up 9% sequentially and 33% year over year. Notably, some of the benefits from such a large increase in paid clicks was offset by 5% and 11% decreases in cost-per-click, or the amount advertisers pay Alphabet for each click, but the outsized gain in paid clicks was significant enough to help drive significant revenue growth.\n\nInvestors should look for look for similar trends in Alphabet's paid clicks and cost-per-clicks in Q4. If the trends diverge in an unexpected direction, investors may want to look for an explanation from management during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nNew Google products\n\nAlso, after launching some new Google-branded hardware, investors also may want to look for some updates from management on how these products are faring. While the new products still almost certainly will be immaterial to overall results, a promising start for the new devices could signal bigger opportunity ahead.\n\nGoogle Home. Image source: Google.\n\nIn October, Alphabet launched two new significant products: a Google Pixel smartphone and a Google Home artificial intelligence-enabled smart speaker. The Pixel quickly sold out online, and Google Home ended up selling out in many stores during the holidays -- evidence of the high demand for these new products. Indeed, in a statement to 9to5Google, a Google spokesperson specifically said demand was to blame for the Pixel selling out:\n\nWe're thrilled to see the excitement for our new Pixel phones, and frankly pre-order demand has exceeded our expectations. We're working to restock our inventory as soon as possible.\n\nWhile Alphabet hasn't yet proven it can build a sustainable and meaningful hardware business, maybe the Pixel smartphone and Google Home could finally change this.\n\nAlphabet will report its fourth-quarter results immediately after market close on Jan. 26. Management will host a conference call to discuss the results at 4:30 p.m. EST.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It starts with a “C” for cash and Alphabet (GOOGL) is going to make tons of it for investors, according to Cowen and Company.\n\nIn a research note to investors Tuesday, Cowen analyst John Blackledge, citing continued strength in Google’s search business combined with a dominant position in YouTube amid secular transition to digital video advertising, issued a $1,050 price target on GOOGL stock. Blackledge, who was already a GOOGL bull with a $1,000 target, maintained an Outperform rating.\n\nAlphabet shares closed Tuesday at $826.01, down a fraction. The stock has already risen 4.17% year to date, besting the 1.4% risen in the S&P 500 Index. But over the past year, Alphabet’s 13% rise has trailed the S&P 500 Index’s 18% gain. Blackledge’s $1,050 price target, however, calls for Alphabet to deliver additional premiums of almost 30%. And the company’s strong advertising prowess will be the main driver.\n\n“Overall, results point to search being an enduring franchise and YouTube's ascension in video as a primary platform for new branding initiatives,” Blackledge said in his note Tuesday. “Our brand focused respondents still acknowledged that GOOG Search offers the highest ROI [return on investment], which we think aptly demonstrates the moat around GOOG’s core business,” the analyst explained.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine Blackledge’s optimism could still be underestimating Google’s potential. According to research firm eMarketer, Google will rake in more than $42 billion in mobile internet ad revenues in 2017, which would be about 41% higher than Facebook’s (FB) expected total of $30 billion. What’s more, Google’s mobile internet ad revenue for 2018 is expected to grow by around 15%, reaching north of $48 billion.\n\nBoth Google and Facebook combined get about 85 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising. And in the case of Google, which has struggled to grow its mobile business, the company has begun to figure it out. The fact that third quarter mobile ad revenue reached $22.45 billion, climbing 23% year-over-year, makes Google an even bigger advertising force to be reckoned with.\n\nAnd when factoring the strength of YouTube, which Blackledge noted is generating robust daily viewership in the “hundreds of millions of hours,” $1,050 price target suddenly seems like a discount. From a valuation perspective, GOOGL stock is priced at 20 times fiscal 2017 estimates of $41.08 per share. While that might not seem like a bargain, compared to the 18 P/E of the S&P 500 Index, the company is growing EPS 19% for 2017.\n\nBottom line: You’ve got a dominant advertising behemoth with virtually no competition that is growing earnings at almost 20% annual rate that has $80 billion in net cash on the balance sheet with another $33 billion in operating cash flow. What would you pay for that business? The rate of Alphabet’s revenue and earnings growth should command a higher multiple of 26, not 20, which puts the stock, yes, right around $1,050.", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA perfect storm of Donald Trump's surprise election, encouraging jobs data and the usual holiday optimism on Wall Street have spurred stocks to new heights over the past two months. But Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) stock has been conspicuous in its absence from the recent rally.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have each risen more than 6% since Trump was elected. Amazon stock is up a mere 1.5%, and that's all in the past week.\n\nI think that post-New Year's bump is only the beginning of a long overdue rally in Amazon stock. Here are three reasons why.\n\nThe Holidays Were Good to Amazon.com\n\nThe shift in consumer shopping from big-box stores to the web continued this holiday season, and no company benefits more from that shift than Amazon. Sales improved 11% over last year's holiday season, and AMZN transactions accounted for a whopping 38% of all online sales - Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE: BBY ) ranked second with 4%.\n\nThat bodes well for Amazon's fourth-quarter sales, due for release on Jan. 26. After the company missed earnings by a wide margin in the third quarter, AMZN stock nosedived nearly 14% in three weeks. It has taken another six weeks for the stock to recover. Speaking of which …\n\nAmazon Stock Just Broke Through a Big Technical Barrier\n\nI tend to like stocks to prove themselves before I recommend them. To me, bottom-buying is little more than guess work. A week ago, Amazon stock was stuck in the mud. Now it's proving itself again. AMZN just broke above its 50-day moving average for the first time since the late-October earnings miss, and was up nearly 40 points in two trading sessions.\n\nPraise for Amazon's Alexa presentation at this week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas was one catalyst; beginning-of-the-year buying of slumping growth stocks appears to be another, as Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) (which combined with Amazon comprise the so-called \"FANG\" stocks) have all built up a full head of steam since the calendar flipped to 2017.\n\nIf AMZN beats earnings in two weeks, look for more bulls to swoop in and push the stock well into the $800s.\n\nDrones, Groceries and Sports Apparel\n\nWhat makes Amazon such a good company - and AMZN such a hard stock to keep down for long - is its diversification and wow factor. Jeff Bezos is never short on ideas for a new revenue stream, and the past few weeks have illustrated that.\n\nIn December, the company unveiled its first Amazon Go, a grocery store without cashiers or checkout lines; it made its first-ever (and long-promised) drone delivery, in England; and it hinted at plans to launch its own athleisure line, with the intent to compete with Lululemon Athletica inc. (NASDAQ: LULU ).\n\nAnd that was all before Alexa was reportedly the toast of last week's Consumer Electronics Show, as both Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) and Volkswagen AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS: VLKAY ) announced plans to include the virtual voice assistant as part of their infotainment systems in new cars.\n\nThe Alexa-automakers partnership alone helped move the needle for Amazon stock this week, a sign that AMZN buyers are back. With no shortage of innovative catalysts on the horizon, look for the recent mini-rally in Amazon stock to pick up steam in the coming weeks and months.\n\nWhether you're a long-term investor or a trader looking to make a quick profit, I'd snatch up AMZN now.\n\nAs of this writing, Chris Fraley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post 3 Reasons Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) is just a few weeks away from its next earnings report. And thanks to a lot of news in the past several months, it could result in a big move for AAPL stock.\n\nLast quarter, the tech company recorded its first year-over-year revenue decline since 2001. Those Apple earnings results were expected, of course, but still not easy to swallow. Furthermore, profits barely met expectations.\n\nHowever, management didn't only have bad news to share with AAPL stock holders. Forward guidance at the end of 2016 was very strong, both for sales and margins, and that could mean a big turnaround is in order when the next Apple earnings report drops.\n\nThere are merits to either side of the trade, but should you buy Apple Inc. here or sell the company right now? Here are three pros and three cons to help you decide:\n\nPros of AAPL Stock\n\nValue Play: For all the talk about the end of Apple's go-go growth, it's important to acknowledge the company has matured and evolved into a strong value play. Right now the stock trades for just under 12 times future earnings, well under the forward price-earnings ratio of about 19 for the S&P 500 or Nasdaq indices.\n\nCash King: By the way, that forward P/E of 11 doesn't back out the copious cash Apple Inc. is sitting on. Right now the tally is roughly $220 billion, give or take, or about a third of its market cap. If you don't think some of that money is accessible thanks to repatriation issues, then consider the more than $50 billion in annual free cash flow. That's plenty of dry powder right there.\n\nReturn of Capital: At its current perch of $119, AAPL stock yields a decent 1.9%. It also executed $29 billion worth of stock buybacks in the prior four quarters. Between these dividends and buybacks, Apple Inc. has returned more than $186 billion in capital to shareholders since 2012.\n\nTo keep reading and get 3 reasons to steer clear of Apple stock, click here or use the navigation below.\n\nCons of AAPL Stock\n\niPhone Overreliance: Part of the reason growth has slowed for Apple stock lately is because it is heavily reliant on its iconic iPhone to generate revenue. Right now, the device still accounts for about two-thirds of the top line, so it's very difficult to imagine AAPL stock moving higher as this core part of its business decays or flatlines.\n\nStuck in a Rut: Shares have been bouncing around lately, but longer-term have remained range bound between $100 and $120 a share since late 2014. Sure, if you bought AAPL stock at $100 and unloaded at $120 that's a nice 20% profit … but shares are now at the upper bounds of that range again and that could mean a rocky road lies ahead.\n\nTech Is Unforgiving: There's always a lot of lip service paid to \"innovative\" companies with a history of \"disruption,\" but history shows it is quite rare for a once-dominant large-cap tech company to regain its former glory after it stumbles. Whether you're talking about Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) or recently acquired Yahoo Inc , it's clear that once these big players take a breather, newer and hungrier companies tend to step in and fill the space. Be careful before you assume AAPL stock is any different.\n\nJeff Reeves is the editor of InvestorPlace.com and the author of The Frugal Investor's Guide to Finding Great Stocks .

(AAPL) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "\n\nImage source: Apple.\n\nAt the beginning of 2016, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook was faced with the fact that iPhone sales would decline for the first time in history that year. To shift Wall Street's focus away from the impending decline in unit sales he aptly pointed out, \"A growing portion of our revenue is directly driven by our existing install base. Because our customers are very satisfied and engaged, they spend a lot of time on their devices and purchase apps, content, and other services.\"\n\nIndeed, while iPhone sales declined 12% in fiscal 2016, Apple's services continued climbing higher for the year. A big part of that growth is the continued increase in sales through the App Store. Earlier this month, Apple provided a roundup of App Store highlights from 2016. Here are the five most important facts for Apple investors to know.\n\nApp developers earned $20 billion last year\n\nApple paid out $20 billion to iOS developers in 2016. That's up 40% year over year, according to Apple.\n\nThe $20 billion paid to developers implies Apple kept over $8 billion in revenue for itself using its standard 30/70 split. While some subscription services received a higher revenue share, they still represent a relatively small percentage of App Store revenue. Last year, Apple generated an estimated $6 billion in revenue from the App Store.\n\nApple's user base is significantly more willing to pay for apps and services than Google's. The Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) subsidiary consistently sees little more than half the revenue from its Play Store as the App Store, according to App Annie. That makes Apple's still-growing install base extremely valuable even if iPhone unit sales declined.\n\n2.2 million apps available\n\nThe 2.2 million apps available for download in the App Store represent a 20% increase year over year. Additionally, the most recent update is indicative that developers are steadily adding apps to the App Store. Apple announced that it reached 2 million apps in June at its WWDC presentation -- just about the halfway point of the year.\n\nSeveral new apps made a big splash in 2016, including Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run . Just as importantly, if not more so, older games such as Monster Strike and Fantasy Westward were some of the top-grossing apps in the App Store.\n\nWhile Apple is adding a good number of new apps, sales are growing much faster. That's a good sign of an expanding user base and a growing willingness to pay for apps.\n\n$240 million in sales on New Year's Day\n\nJan. 1 was once again Apple's biggest sales day for the App Store. Last year, it set a new record on New Year's Day with $144 million in sales. This year, sales rocketed 67% year over year to $240 million.\n\nThat growth is a strong indicator that Apple may continue to see robust growth from the App Store in 2017.\n\n$2.7 billion in subscription revenue\n\nOf the $28 billion or so in App Store sales, nearly 10% came from subscriptions. This summer, Apple altered its revenue share agreement with subscription services, dropping from a 30/70 split to a 15/85 split after one year. This gave an incentive to more subscription services to start offering subscriptions through the App Store.\n\nThe growth of the Apple TV App Store also likely led to an increase in subscription sales for Apple. 2016 represented the first full year Apple opened the platform to all developers.\n\nChina grew 90%\n\nApp sales in China grew 90% year over year in 2016. China surpassed the U.S. as the largest download market for iOS apps in the first quarter, according to App Annie . However, it still trails the U.S. and Japan in terms of App Store revenue for now.\n\nWhile China represents one of Apple's largest markets, sales in the region declined more than its other regions in 2016. The iPhone 6 was extremely popular in the country during fiscal 2015, leading to a decline in sales the next year. But App Store sales continue to climb faster than Apple's average. That's indicative of the large opportunity of the relatively young user base in the region.\n\nOverall, Apple's App Store had another great year of growth, and 2017 looks to be off to a strong start.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Apple\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But I've owned shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) -- formerly known as Google -- for almost a decade, and I can't fathom a circumstance under which I'd consider parting with my shares.\n\nImage source: Google Canada.\n\nCurrently, shares of the company make up a whopping 13% of my family's real-life stock holdings. But we're totally comfortable with that allocation.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. The company's flagship product has a dominant market (and mind) share\n\nIf you're sitting around the dinner table arguing about a provable fact, you resolve the dispute by simply \"Googling\" the answer. The fact that the name is so embedded in our lexicon speaks volumes to the search engine's dominance.\n\nAccording to Statista, Alphabet's Google search owns 90.4% of the global market on desktops. And perhaps more important, according to NetMarketShare, it commands 93.8% of the mobile search market share globally.\n\n2. It boasts six other products with over 1 billion users\n\nBut as you're probably well aware, Google is much more than just search. It has six other applications with over 1 billion users. These include Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, Chrome, Android, and Google Play Store.\n\n3. That all adds up to a lot of data\n\n\"Sure,\" you might say, \"but the company doesn't charge for most of those products. That's not great business.\"\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nWhile you'd be right, you'd be missing out on what's dubbed the \"oil of the information age\": data. With every user in all seven of those aforementioned apps, the company is able to collect gobs of data. In fact, I don't think it would be too hard to argue that Google has more data on the people walking this earth than any other organization, at any other time in human history.\n\n4. At its heart, it is still an advertising company\n\nThat data is worth billions to advertisers. In the old days, companies would try to target their audience by putting ads in magazines or newspapers where potential customers might be lurking. But the feedback loop wasn't great: Advertisers never knew just how effective that ad spending was.\n\nNot so anymore. With Google's advertising platform, companies get real-time feedback on how efficiently their ads are being placed, and how much business they produce. Given the data hoard that the company has, ads placed through Google can be more targeted to the perfect customer than any other available source. That's a huge moat for the company.\n\nIt also helps explain why Google advertising brought in $67 billion in sales last year for the company, or 90% of all revenue.\n\n5. Digital ads are poised to grow\n\nIf you think you've missed the boat, rest assured you haven't. A March 2016 report from eMarketer shows that there's still a lot of room for internet advertising to grow.\n\nImage source: eMarketer.\n\nAnd with TV still retaining one-third of the global market share in 2019, I can only imagine that the runway for internet ad growth will continue for much of the next decade.\n\n6. The company is more than a one-trick pony\n\nBack to that name change, from \"Google\" to \"Alphabet.\" You might better understand the reasoning if you look at the new corporate name as \"Alpha-Bet.\" This rendering of the name reflects the company's practice of taking a lot of moonshot bets on revolutionary technologies outside its main search and data-capturing business.\n\nThis is what famed trader, academic, and thinker Nassim Taleb would call a barbell approach: having a large a reliable stream of revenue on one side while taking lots of small bets on the other. While the likelihood of any one moonshot succeeding is small, all it will take is one or two winners over the next decade to make a meaningful difference for shareholders.\n\nWhat are these moonshots? We probably don't know all of them, but the ones we do include self-driving cars, a connected home, a life sciences company, and lightning-fast internet connection.\n\n7. Its mission statement is memorable\n\nI'm a sucker for a good mission statement. When it is clear and powerful, it can be the compass that helps guide management and employees alike toward a common goal.\n\nGoogle's mission statement is: \"To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.\"\n\nThe mission of new-formed parent company Alphabet is multifaceted but can be broken down to: \"Getting more ambitious things done[,] ... empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish ... [and] as a result of all this, improving the lives of as many people as we can.\"\n\nThose are both powerful and flexible enough objectives to keep the company relevant in a quickly changing world.\n\n8. It has soul in the game\n\nLest you think that you might have a few executives who are in this for short-term gain, Alphabet is still run by its co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Together, they -- along with all of the other company executives and board members -- own almost 48 million shares of Alphabet, and account for 60% of the company's voting power. To put the number of shares in perspective, it is equivalent to almost $40 billion at today's prices.\n\n9. The proof is in the culture\n\nAnother metric that's often overlooked is a company's culture. If Page and Brin really do want to accomplish the ambitious goals they've laid out, they need a stable and motivated workforce to get things done.\n\nTo get an idea for the company's approach, a 2010 filing with the SEC stated that \"[monetary] incentives are secondary to career growth, work environment, and engaging work opportunities. We seek to develop a highly motivated and collaborative workforce that pursues achievements for the sake of progress and innovation before individual gain.\"\n\nBased on employee reviews on Glassdoor.com, I'd say the company is doing pretty well.\n\nImage and data credit: Glassdoor\n\n10. There is lots of cash to make it work\n\nFinally, if you've got a company that's going to be taking lots of small bets that can be costly, it's good to know that management is sitting on a pretty expansive war chest. And that's what you get with Alphabet.\n\nLong-term debt: $3.9 billion\n\nCash, short-, and long-term investments: $88.8 billion\n\nThis, and the other nine reasons above, helps me sleep well at night knowing my family is invested in -- and likely won't sell for a long time -- such a company.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A shares)\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Seemingly contradicting those statements is a report yesterday from Recode that says the social network is preparing to implement mid-roll video ads, which play in the middle of a video, opening up a new form of monetization for publishers that will share ad revenue with Facebook. Publishers will keep 55% of ad revenue, with the remaining 45% going to Facebook. Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube, which is the top dog in the video ad market, offers the same revenue-sharing split.\n\nIf this report is true, the move would represent a departure from CEO Mark Zuckerberg's long-standing ban on pre-roll ads, which play at the beginning of a video. That's largely why publishers have had such a hard time building video businesses on the social network, since not allowing pre-roll ads significantly hinders monetization. Yet Facebook is too large to ignore, so publishers continue to try to expand on the platform despite the challenging economics to date. The company has been experimenting and slowly rolling out new ways for publishers to make money, but a broader deployment of mid-roll ads would represent a big step in the right direction for publishers.\n\nKeeping Facebookers engaged\n\nThe new mid-roll ads will only be presented after a user has watched at least 20 seconds of a video, and the total clip length must be at least 90 seconds. That sets a minimum threshold for engagement; Facebook wants publishers to produce engaging content that keeps people's attention in order to earn that video ad revenue. This makes sense if you go back and look through the aforementioned comments from November discussing ad load.\n\nCFO Dave Wehner had mentioned that ad load was but one of three major factors that have been contributing to revenue growth. User growth naturally contributes quite a bit as well, spurring advertiser demand. The third factor is the growth in time spent on Facebook. Here's some additional color that Wehner provided in November:\n\nJust really reiterating what I said last quarter about our expectations on ad load going into mid-2017. It's been one of the key factors in terms of driving growth, along with time spent -- user growth and time spent growth and advertiser demand. So we continue to see good opportunities to grow time spent, continue to see good opportunities to grow users, and we continue to see good opportunities to grow advertiser demand. On that latter point, really the mix of ad units is part of what we're doing, I think, really well. We're developing a number of new ad products as well as enhancing the ad products that we have out in the market today. So we're taking what is a great mobile ad product on Facebook and Instagram and making it even better. And I think the investments that we're doing there will continue to enable us to drive advertiser demand. Those key factors will continue, we believe, to drive growth next year. So what I'm specifically talking about is ad load and our anticipation that it's going to be a less significant factor as we get into mid-2017.\n\nOverall, Facebook's ad platform continues to evolve, offering a wider range of ad formats that can accommodate a wider range of content types. The overall ad load may not increase much, so it's a good thing that video ads are incredibly lucrative.\n\nFind out why Facebook is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\n\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .", "Image source: Facebook.\n\nFacebook (NASDAQ: FB) is starting to get serious about letting users cash in on their popularity. Industry sources are telling Recode that Facebook is working with video publishers to test a \"mid-roll\" ad format on longer clips, a move that would take it a baby step closer to Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube in terms of content monetization.\n\nIt's important to frame this move correctly. Unlike YouTube, which lets any user apply to participate in revenue-sharing deals on their original uploads, Facebook's move is currently limited to established media companies. The videos must also be at least 90 seconds long to participate, something that may seem like an eternity in this clip culture.\n\nWe also don't know if Facebook's massive audience will put up with ads that interrupt a video 20 seconds into the streaming process. If pre-roll ads on Alphabet's YouTube are groan generators, it's hard to favor an advertising format that cuts into a clip just when the viewer is starting to grow engaged.\n\nHowever, there's a method to Facebook's madness. Making publishers put out longer videos to hit the 90-second minimum and making them engaging enough to retain viewers 20 seconds into the clip will make the social networking hub more engaging.\n\nTaking on YouTube\n\nVideo and eventually video advertising have been part of Facebook's master plan for some time. With 1.79 billion monthly active users, giving the internet's largest social networking audience some eye candy makes sense. However, with YouTube and recently Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) ramping up their monetization tools, Facebook is going to have to start offering financial incentives to top creators if it doesn't want folks to take their viral videos somewhere else.\n\nRevenue-sharing deals have been around since Alphabet launched the YouTube Partners program in 2007. Twitter would go on to revamp Twitter Amplify in 2015, letting major entertainment brands cash in on pre-roll video ads streaming through the site. The program was reportedly opening up to individual creators late last year.\n\nFacebook will inevitably have to follow suit. Facebook Live has helped the site become the home to several news-generating streams , but if it wants folks to rely on it as their primary broadcasting hub, they are going to have to transform Facebook into a cottage industry for 1.79 billion cottages. Alphabet's YouTube is doing that (and successfully). Twitter is trying.\n\nIt won't be easy for Facebook. Folks already accept ads on YouTube, and YouTube has gotten better by rolling out a wide array of ad types. Facebook has limited the revenue-generating opportunities on its clips only to high-end publishers and then mostly through brand sponsorships that aren't as invasive as the mid-roll ads it will reportedly be testing out now. However, if Facebook users don't flinch -- and if Facebook is quick to roll out these options to much smaller publishers -- it can make the already sticky social networking giant even more engaging to both content creators and content consumers.\n\nFind out why Facebook is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\n\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Sure, it generated $17.1 billion in operating income through the first nine months of its current fiscal year on $64.2 billion in revenue, but at the end of the day GOOGL stock only managed a total return for shareholders of 1.9%.\n\nSource: Brionv via Wikimedia (Modified)\n\nThat's on par with its internet content peers, but way off the 12% delivered by the S&P 500 . Not good by Google standards.\n\nHolding GOOGL stock back - a bit of a misnomer considering that it has nearly doubled the return of the S&P 500 over the past five years - is a valuation that InvestorPlace contributor Dana Blankenhorn feels is \"priced to near-perfection\" with a price-earnings ratio of 29 based on a consensus per-share earnings estimate of $26.90 in 2016, $32.25 in 2017 and $36.99 in 2018.\n\nSo, analysts expect Alphabet to grow earnings by 17.3% annually over the next two years - that's a two-year PEG ratio of 1.7. By comparison, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) has a two-year PEG ratio of 1.6 based on annual EPS growth of 29%.\n\nFrom this perspective, GOOGL stock doesn't look too bad; you have to conclude that either FB is overvalued at this point or GOOGL isn't quite as expensive as people think.\n\nEspecially when you consider that there's still gas in Alphabet's tank.\n\nGoogle Travel Is Fueling GOOGL\n\nLeading the charge is its travel business which has quietly become a key element in Alphabet's success. As the travel vertical prospers, so too does Google and its parent.\n\nAccording to Dennis Schaal of Skift, Google's travel business will generate an estimated $12.2 billion in advertising revenue in 2016, accounting for 13.7% of Alphabet's projected 2016 revenue of $89.3 billion. Put another way, Google's travel business will generate approximately 1,670% [calculation: $12.2/4 multiplied by 3 divided by Other Bets Q1-Q32016 revenue of $547 million] more revenue in 2016 than its Other Bets segment, which includes much of the innovative work being done by the company, including Nest, Fiber, etc.\n\nOn its own, Google Travel would be a pretty large company with operating profits of $3.8 billion. While advertising might be boring, one can't underestimate the importance of this vertical to the company's profitable growth.\n\nAnd you can forget about Google becoming an online travel agency with this much money on the line. It's not going to cut off its nose to spite the face. It's just not.\n\n\"Google's existing revenue from travel advertisers is already considerably larger than that of the Priceline Group Inc (NASDAQ: PCLN ); is roughly twice the size of Expedia Inc's (NASDAQ: EXPE ), and Google generates more travel advertising revenue than that of Expedia, Ctrip (NASDAQ: CTRP ) and TripAdvisor Inc (NASDAQ: TRIP ) combined,\" wrote Schaal in his November 2016 article on the subject. \"Google undoubtedly takes that travel-advertising revenue and achieves a much higher profit margin on it than do the roster of its online travel, airline, hotel, car rental and cruise partners.\"\n\nYes, it's true that Google maintains an uneasy relationship with its advertiser partners, a relationship they sometimes resent, but until they can successfully build a workable alternative , they'll need Google more than Google needs them.\n\nNow consider what the company's doing on the venture capital front. In September, CapitalG (formerly Google Capital) led a late-stage $850 million round of financing of Airbnb that values the private company at $30 billion. Some of the funds raised by the home-sharing service will be used to set up its own flight booking service to compete with some of Google's bigger advertising partners (Priceline, Expedia) in that very competitive segment of the online travel business.\n\nWhile Airbnb currently spends about $300 million in advertising with Google on an annual basis, you can expect that number to increase once Airbnb gets its second stream of revenue online sometime in 2017.\n\nUtilizing CapitalG to fund opportunities within the travel space that don't put them directly in competition with their advertisers is the key to future success for both the travel vertical and Alphabet itself.\n\nI like GOOGL stock for a lot of different reasons, but its travel business is certainly one of them.\n\nAs of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post The Key to Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Isn't What You Think appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlaceInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is a regular favorite among tech investors, and for good reason. After bottoming out around $10 a share after the dot-com crash, AMZN stock has raced up to a recent high of about $850 a share before pulling back. Had you got out at the top, that would have turned a $1,000 investment in Amazon stock into $85,000.\n\nOf course, Amazon.com has changed a lot over the past 15 years or so. A decade ago, the story was all about e-commerce and how AMZN was killing traditional retailers. Last year, it was all about the rapid growth of Amazon Web Services. Now, its virtual assistant Alexa is all the rage.\n\nBut investors in Amazon stock aren't buying the past. They are buying the future. And in 2017, with so much growth behind AMZN stock, it's reasonable to wonder whether it can keep this up.\n\nIf you're wondering whether Amazon stock is a buy or a sell here after its big run, here are three pros and three cons to help you decide.\n\nPros of Amazon Stock\n\nInnovation: Amazon started with a vision to be the world's largest bookstore. It then moved into everything from shoes to flat-screen TVs and now touches every part of retail imaginable. After that, it started cranking out its own Kindle hardware and developed its much-hyped cloud computing arm AWS. Nobody knows what's next from Amazon - drones, perhaps? - but you can be sure this company is not sitting still.\n\nRevenue Growth: With a growth rate of about 28% in fiscal 2016, Amazon's top line is moving higher at a very nice clip But what's really amazing is that the base number is already huge - starting the year at over $100 billion! But lest you think AMZN stock can't keep that rate up, it's projecting over 20% revenue growth again in 2017 despite starting from roughly $130 billion in annual sales. That's simply amazing.\n\nThe Sky Is the Limit: As of Q3 2016, fewer than 10% of total U.S. retail sales were e-commerce transactions. And while Amazon is dominant among this with a roughly 51% share , there is plenty of room for it to gain a larger piece of the pie even as the pie keeps growing. This, coupled with the company's ability to branch out into other areas and a will to invest heavily in R&D, means there is literally nothing AMZN stock can't do in the years ahead.\n\nTo keep reading and get 3 reasons to steer clear of Twitter stock, click here or use the navigation below.\n\nCons of Amazon Stock\n\nProfit Challenges: One of the biggest catalysts for AMZN stock in the last year or two has been the profitability of Amazon Web Services, which led to a rare stretch of quarterly profits for the tech giant. However, those profits have started to fade again, and a big earnings miss in September 2016 disappointed investors and has largely held the stock back ever since. Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos wants to plow every penny of profits back into the company, but Wall Street may want something different now that it got a taste for actual earnings.\n\nRisk of Retail Hubris: Amazon stock holders and CEO Jeff Bezos think anything goes at AMZN, but remember the flop that was the Fire Phone ? That was a costly boondoggle that ultimately led to the firing of engineers in charge of the project. Right now, Amazon may be making a similar mistake as it jockeys to purchase the defunct American Apparel and opens brick-and-mortar bookstores in New York and elsewhere. Sure, Amazon is dominant … but is it now being unrealistic about where it can compete by entering physical retail?\n\nUnrealistic Expectations: With so much buzz around AWS and Alexa and with such high expectations for its core e-commerce business, it's natural to think disappointment lies ahead. After all, Amazon Web Services was growing revenue at a 78% rate in Q3 2015 and that fell to a much more modest 55% growth rate in Q3 2016 . More is more, yes, but as any momentum investor will tell you it's all about expectations and not the core growth rate. Amazon investors may have unrealistic expectations after 2016, and it will be difficult even for this fast-growing stock to keep up.\n\nJeff Reeves is the editor of InvestorPlace.com and the author of The Frugal Investor's Guide to Finding Great Stocks .

Products like Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Echo/Alexa and Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Home, along with Apple 's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone/Siri, have become viable platforms to control smart homes. And while only Amazon and Google have an official presence at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), smart-home devices that work with one or more of those platforms (as well as others) were one of the dominant trends at the show.\n\nIn fact, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which puts on the show, released a new report on the eve of CES saying that smart homes would be the \"most popular means of Internet of Things engagement.\" CTA also predicted sales of 29 million units in 2017, a 63% percent increase over 2016.\n\nTo make that happen, companies need to deliver devices that meet consumer needs. A new survey from Coldwell Banker Real Estate and Vivint Smart Homes found that there is one feature that a majority of Americans want on their smart-home devices: voice control.\n\nSmart home devices were everywhere at CES 2017. Image source: author.\n\nWhat does the survey say?\n\nThe report showed that more than 7 in 10 (72%) Americans who already have smart-home products controlled remotely by a smartphone, tablet, computer, or separate automatic system within the home itself want voice control. But, only 48% of people who have smart-home devices, the report found, already have voice control capability.\n\n\"We're not surprised that so many Americans want to be able to use their voice to control smart home products because it makes for a much more intuitive user experience,\" said Coldwell Banker Chief Marketing Officer Sean Blankenship. \" ... we're hearing directly from our agents that their clients are demanding voice control to make their smart home experience more seamless.\"\n\nParents want voice control, according to the research, and nearly 4 in 5 (79%) of Generation X members have smart-home products but want voice control. That's followed by millennials at 74%, and baby boomers at 63%.\n\n\"Last year we announced our integration with Amazon Echo and we've been blown away with how consumers are unlocking the full potential of a voice-controlled smart home,\" said Vivint CMO Jeff Lyman. \"By simply saying aloud what they want to happen with their locks, lights, thermostats and security system, customers spend more time living and less time managing. The experience is pretty magical.\"\n\nWhat are Americans using voice control for?\n\nWhen it comes to people who have smart homes with voice control and people who want smart homes with voice control, the top use in both cases is entertainment. That was the top use for the former at 57% and the latter at 43%. In both cases, controlling smart lighting was the second choice.\n\nImage source: Coldwell Banker/Vivint.\n\nWhy is voice control important?\n\nMost Americans believe that voice control will give them a more intuitive user experience, according to the Coldwell Banker/Vivint report, which was produced by surveying 4,108 U.S. adults ages 18 and older, among whom 923 have any smart home products. \"The most commonly cited benefits for using voice control among respondents were hands-free control at 30%, increased user-friendliness at 17% and flexibility in location at 14%,\" read the study.\n\nPart of the reason Americans want voice control in their smart-home devices is because they are already comfortable with the technology. Of the people surveyed who already have smart-home products, 74% of them said they use voice control on their smartphones.\n\nThis is what's coming\n\nWhile Siri has stumbled at least partly because Apple launched it without tightly limiting its parameters and Google's Assistant has yet to make much of a mark, Amazon Echo shows that people will use voice control at home. Going from asking a digital assistant to tell you the weather or playing a song to having one actually control your home will take some time.\n\nAmazon has taken a smart approach by slowly adding functionality and opening up its Echo/Alexa platform to outside developers. That has given the company a foothold in people's houses that might allow it to expand its presence. Apple, Google, and maybe even a few others have a chance to work their way in as well (and a quick look around at CES shows that dozens, maybe hundreds are trying to get involved in some fashion), but it's very clear that whatever products people select, voice control will have to be a key component.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) may have missed the mark with 2016's iPhone 7 and new MacBook Pro laptops, but there was one area where the company was firing on all cylinders.\n\nSource: Apple\n\nAAPL announced that it absolutely blew past its previous records related to the App Store, notching $240 million in customer purchases on New Year's Day alone, and paying out over $20 billion to app developers in 2016.\n\nApple's App Store Records\n\nApple's press release was quick and to the point. The heading was \"App Store shatters records on New Year's Day,\" and instead of a preamble there were two bullet points:\n\n$240 million in customer purchases makes January 1, 2017 the App Store's busiest day ever.\n\nApp developers earned $20 billion in 2016 - up 40 percent from 2015.\n\nThose two points say a lot; $240 million in revenue in a single day is huge. To put that number in some perspective, it equals the revenue that GoPro Inc. (NASDAQ: GPRO ) collected in its entire third quarter. Snap Inc. - the company behind the wildly popular Snapchat app that's prepping for an IPO that could be worth $25 billion - is expected to have generated between $250 million and $350 million in ad revenue in 2016. The whole year.\n\nIn other words, the revenue that AAPL generated from App Store sales alone in a single day hit the level that some of the best-known technology companies take an entire quarter (or longer) to reach.\n\nA single-day sales record (especially one set during the holidays) should naturally be taken with a grain of salt. However, the Apple App Store has been on fire for all of 2016.\n\nApple says App Store revenue for December topped $3 billion. A 40% increase in the amount of money paid out to app developers compared to 2015 indicates strong growth. That's even when accounting for changes to AAPL's App Store terms last summer that saw in-app subscription fees collected by the company drop from 30% to 15% for long-term subscriptions - putting more of the App Store revenue in developers' pockets.\n\nSuper Mario Run Helped Drive App Store Revenue\n\nNintendo Co., Ltd. (OTCMKTS: NTDOY ) certainly helped the Apple App Store's numbers. According to AAPL, its Super Mario Run game was the No. 1 app for downloads globally on both Christmas Day and New Year's Day.\n\nThe game was downloaded over 40 million times within just four days of release, and despite only being available in December, it placed in the top 10 most downloaded apps for all of 2016.\n\nApp Store Popularity Helps Drive iPhone and iPad Sales\n\nApp Store revenue was a big reason why Apple's Services division revenue grew 24% last quarter to hit a record $6.3 billion , making it the second biggest source of revenue for the company after the iPhone. That alone makes the App Store important to AAPL.\n\nThe fact that Services was the only division to see growth in the last quarter also underscores its importance.\n\nSuper Mario Run helps to illustrate another importance of the App Store. It may have been eclipsed by Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google Play in sheer number of apps, but the Apple App Store still leads when it comes to access to premium apps. Super Mario Run is a perfect example of this effect in action - it's still not available for Android, and Nintendo is only saying that it will hit Google Play sometime in 2017.\n\nThe success of the App Store in continuing to attract the best apps (many of them exclusives) helps Apple to sell the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and even Apple TV. Outside of any hardware or operating system preferences, iOS is the platform that gets the best apps.\n\nAt a time when Apple has been struggling with sliding sales in its hardware divisions and criticism over new product releases, the App Store is a bright light.\n\nAnd with record-setting $240 million in app revenue on the first day of 2017, you can bet AAPL hopes the App Store sets the tone for the rest of this year.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Apple Inc. (AAPL) Shatters One-Day App Store Revs Record With $240M appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "2017 might only be a week old, but it's never too early to predict who will take this year's crown as the top technology company. And I'm not referring to the most-valuable company on a market-cap basis.\n\nThe battle taking place in artificial intelligence, IoT (internet of things), the cloud, the smart home, and various ecosystems for mobile devices, has pitted the usual suspects of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) against each other. And this year, more than any other year, the stakes are much higher.\n\nThe major reason? President-elect Donald Trump's pro-business policies, including his promise to lower corporate taxes, may give tech companies the flexibility they've needed to invest back into their businesses. In 2017 buying back stock won't seem as the best use of capital. Using cash flow for anything other than attempting to innovate and beat the competition will be too risky.\n\nOther than for a couple of trading days last year, during which it was surpassed by Alphabet, Apple has been the world's most-valuable company based on market cap since passing Exxon (XOM) in 2012, thanks to the success of the iPhone. However, since that achievement, including a span during which its generated more money than the U.S. Treasury, there's been questions about Apple's ability to innovate under CEO Tim Cook.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon has tested drone deliveries and has since filed a patent to build a warehouse in the sky. Google has entered into the race for autonomous vehicles, while Microsoft -- under new CEO Satya Nadella -- has built itself into a dominant cloud company. Apple has since made a watch -- one which it still hasn't disclosed sales figures on. Apple stock rebounded last year, posting some 10% returns, after dipping below $90 after its revenue declined for the first time in decade.\n\nWe won't have to wait long to find out which of the four tech giants will take the early lead in 2017. All four companies are set to report their financial results in the next couple of weeks, led by Apple whose numbers are due out on January 24. Apple is coming off the all-important holiday quarter, though reports suggest that the company has recently reduced first-quarter iPhone production by 10%. In other words, a strong Q2 guidance might not be in the cards.\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet will both report on January 26. Microsoft's cloud-first strategy has once-again turned the company into a juggernaut. Shares are trading at tech-bubble highs. For Google, it's all about its advertising metrics. As for Amazon? It already announced record shipments for the holiday quarter. The only question is, will Jeff Bezos focus on growing the company's profit margins or continue to make future investments?\n\nAll told, 2017's tech crown won't be decided this month. For that matter, the winner might not be known for several quarters. But one thing is for certain, I'm not willing to bet my own money against any of them.", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFacebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) had a good 2016. On the calendar year, FB stock gained about 12% to outperform the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 .\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBut even though FB stock outperformed the broader market, it certainly ended the year on a weak note.\n\nAfter the last Facebook earnings report in November, the stock softened up thanks in part to disappointing guidance for 2017. Shares are now down about 10% from their October highs even as the stock market has rallied strongly across the same period.\n\nSome are buying Facebook stock on the dip given the strong history of outperformance in this social media giant. Others are fearful that the growth story could be cooling off, and that the future may be more challenging than the past for FB stock.\n\nSo what's the score? To help investors decide, here are three pros and three cons about Facebook stock right now.\n\nPros of Facebook Stock\n\nConsistent Profit Growth: Unlike smaller rival Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) that has never turned a profit, and unlike older rival Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) that has seen trouble growing the bottom line in recent years, FB stock consistently generates bigger profits each quarter. Consider that when Facebook's fourth-quarter earnings hit. It should report $4.09 in per-share earnings on the full year - more than triple the $1.29 in EPS for fiscal 2015. And looking forward, 2017 profits are on pace to hit about $5.21 in earnings per share, a 27%-plus increase.\n\nUnrivaled Scale: Facebook has over a billion users. And remarkably, it's still growing with total daily active users rising from 1.01 billion in Q3 of 2015 to 1.18 billion in Q3 of 2016. It's simply amazing to consider that a billion people are on this platform EVERY DAY. This gives the company a lot of stability, but also a lot of growth potential for the future since a small gain in profitability per user can mean a big impact on the bottom line of FB stock.\n\nLong-Term Vision: Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg created a heck of a social network. However, he also has been ambitious about the future with the acquisition of companies, including Whatsapp and Oculus VR, as a way to keep ahead of long-term tech trends. For instance, in 2016 Zuckerberg shared a 10-year roadmap that includes more video, search and messenger capabilities in the next five years … and everything from virtual reality to artificial intelligence in the years beyond that. FB stock may not be the winner in these races, but it will at least be running them as other stodgy tech firms are left in the dust.\n\nTo keep reading and get 3 reasons to steer clear of Facebook stock, click here or use the navigation below.\n\nCons of Facebook Stock\n\nCritical Mass: Of course, we've seen this movie before in fast-growing tech stocks that hit a wall. It happened with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO ) after the dot-com days were over, and it has happened more recently to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) after iPhone sales lost momentum. With over a billion users, how much larger can Facebook really get? And with so many ads and distractions crammed into the interface as it is, how much more efficient at monetization can FB stock become?\n\nUnrealistic Expectations: Facebook has powered higher thanks to earnings that have met or exceeded expectations consistently for the past three years or so. But if the rate of growth slows and disappoints, it could get rough in a hurry. All growth names in tech go through this, but thus far FB stock has been on a steady march higher. It can only keep this up for so long before sentiment gets ahead of the numbers and sparks a sell-off.\n\nChallenges to the Core: The most urgent threat to Facebook is that its current cash cow it the platform it began with.

The forthcoming feature film was touted as a professional-quality Star Trek fan film.\n\nAxanar is the story of Garth of Izar, an obscure character and the legendary Starfleet captain who appeared in a 1969 episode. The film tells the story of Garth and his crew during the Four Years War, the war between the Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets.\n\nJudge Klausner ruled that the character of Garth as well as the characteristics of Klingons and Vulcans may be entitled to copyright protection.\n\nIn addition, the plaintiffs submitted evidence showing costumes as well as settings such as planets from the Star Trek copyrighted works to be similar to those used by the defendants in Axanar.\n\nThe judge also noted that while Axanar argued that the film is not commercial as they would be distributed for free, the defendants stood to gain at least indirect commercial benefit from the viewership boost for the film.\n\nKlausner said that a jury will best answer whether Axanar Productions' actions were the result of reckless disregard for, or willful blindness, to the copyright holders' rights.\n\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\n\nhttp://www.rttnews.com\n\nThis article appears in: News Headlines", "\n\nImage source: Amazon.\n\nIn CEO Jeff Bezos' annual letter to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) shareholders from April 2016, he highlighted the company's three pillars: Prime (its $99-a-year membership), Marketplace (where it sells items), and Amazon Web Services (its cloud computing business). All three have been instrumental to Amazon's success over the past decade-plus and Bezos wrote, \"I assure you that we also remain hard at work on finding a fourth [pillar].\"\n\nIt looks like that fourth pillar could be the Echo smart speaker featuring the Alexa digital assistant.\n\nIt's been two years since Amazon unveiled the Echo, which can serve as a hub for other smart-home devices like thermostats and lightbulbs, and its functionality has been extended through third-party \"skills,\" which function like voice-controlled apps. Amazon has the scale and infrastructure necessary to grow the Echo and Alexa into its fourth pillar.\n\nVoice computing is the future\n\nNobody expects using voice-activated digital assistants will replace using smartphones or desktop computers, not even Bezos. However, there's clearly a growing trend toward using voice search and interacting with digital assistants.\n\nGoogle recently released a device similar to Echo, Google Home, in order to take advantage of the trend. Additionally, the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary said voice searches tripled over the last two years.\n\nAs the artificial intelligence (AI) powering these devices improves, their usefulness increases. And as they're used more, the AI improves, creating a virtuous cycle.\n\nAnother virtuous cycle for Amazon\n\nAmazon has a first-mover advantage in the smart speaker category, and its success with its Kindle line gives consumers confidence in its brand. But Amazon's biggest advantage with the Echo and Alexa is how it can integrate its existing Prime and Marketplace pillars into its Echo business.\n\nOne of the primary ways Google is considering monetizing voice searches is through commerce. It recently released a development kit for retailers and service providers to create apps for Google Assistant -- the AI powering Google Home and found in several other Google apps -- to connect with potential customers. Eventually, Google plans to take a cut of sales made through these apps.\n\nBut Amazon already has a direct line to customers and a huge marketplace of items -- one of its three pillars. Customers can order products using Alexa, and Amazon will use your order history to figure out what you want or choose an item based on user reviews and pricing. Of course, that feature is only available to Prime members -- urging more customers to sign up for the service. Non-members can still ask Alexa to add items to their cart for checkout later, but they'd have to finish ordering the old-fashioned way and using your fingers to buy stuff online is so 2014.\n\nAs such, Alexa serves to support Amazon's Marketplace and Prime and vice versa. Similarly, Prime supports the Marketplace business by increasing customer loyalty and attracting new third-party sellers to the platform. That, in turn, brings more Prime-eligible products to the Marketplace, increasing the value of Prime.\n\nAdding Alexa to the mix strengthens the other two pillars, making it another pillar.\n\nAmazon is really pushing Alexa\n\nAmazon is putting a lot of money behind marketing Alexa. It's been running a television and digital video ad campaign over the last year, including a Super Bowl commercial starring Alec Baldwin. Amazon produced over 100 10-second spots for the campaign based on real-life use cases of the voice assistant.\n\nMost recently, Amazon struck a deal with Wynn Hotels to put an Echo device in each of Wynn's 4,748 Las Vegas hotel rooms. The device will be able to control the lights, temperature, drapes, and TV, with potentially more features to come. It's a clever marketing ploy that will introduce thousands of people to the Echo and allow them to have a firsthand experience using it.\n\nBehind the scenes, Amazon has over 1,000 employees working on Alexa, according to Bezos. He also said the current functionality of Alexa is \"just the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nIt's clear from its investments that Amazon sees the huge potential of Alexa. It's not just a stand-alone product, but a potential pillar of its business that supports its other operations -- specifically, Marketplace and Prime.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon.com\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company has come to dominate the retail industry and is rapidly disrupting many other areas of the global economy.\n\nYet with its stock up several hundred times in value since its 1997 IPO, you'd be excused for thinking Amazon's days of turbocharged growth are long gone. There are, however, multiple signals that tremendous gains still lie ahead for the e-commerce titan. Here are seven of the most compelling signs that Amazon's best days may still be ahead.\n\n1. The staggering growth of e-commerce\n\nEven after two decades of torrid growth, the rise of e-commerce is still in its early innings. Online sales comprise less than 10% of all U.S. retail sales, and research firm eMarketer estimates that retail e-commerce sales will increase to more than $4 trillion in 2020, up from about $1.5 trillion in 2015. With tens of millions of new people gaining access to the internet every year, e-commerce appears set to keep growing at a rapid pace for at least another decade, and likely much longer. Amazon stands to benefit from this megatrend, perhaps more than any other company.\n\n2. Dominant consumer mindshare\n\nThere's a reason Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google describes Amazon as its No. 1 competitor : A steadily increasing number of online shoppers start their searches on Amazon.com. In fact, a recent report by marketing firm BloomReach shows that 55% of consumers begin their searches on the retail juggernaut's website when shopping online, up from 44% in 2015. During that time, the percentage of customers who began their product hunts on search engines declined to 28% from 34%. And the share of shoppers whose searches originated at all other retailers' sites combined fell from 21% to only 16%. That's a powerful trend, and a testament to Amazon's large and increasing prominence in the minds of consumers.\n\n3. FBA network effects\n\nOne of the main drivers of Amazon's increasing mindshare among online shoppers is its Fulfilled By Amazon program. The FBA program lets third-party merchants use Amazon's online marketplace and distribution infrastructure to sell their goods. This greatly expands the number of product listings available on Amazon.com, thereby offering more value to consumers. And as more people come to Amazon for their online shopping needs, more product creators and merchants flock to Amazon's FBA platform to sell their wares. This virtuous cycle helps to create powerful network effects for Amazon, whereby each additional consumer and merchant that joins the platform creates more value for existing members of the network -- a cycle that should only continue to grow stronger in the years ahead.\n\n4. The rise of Prime\n\nAnother powerful driver of Amazon's success is its Prime membership program. Research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that the average Prime customer spends $1,200 per year on Amazon, compared to about $600 for non-Prime customers. And while management has yet to disclose the number of Amazon Prime subscribers, CIRP estimates that the number of U.S. Prime members surged 38% year over year to 65 million in the third quarter. With Amazon investing heavily to expand Prime's content and service offerings, it should continue to enjoy rising Prime adoption, which, in turn, should fuel further increases in sales and profit.\n\n5. Struggling competitors\n\nThe magnitude of Amazon's dominance may be best reflected in the misfortunes of its rivals. The business graveyard is littered with brick-and-mortar retailers that could not withstand the Amazon-led onslaught of e-commerce. Recent examples include RadioShack and Sports Authority, and many analysts believe venerable Sears Holdings may soon join the ranks of the deceased . Perhaps most telling of all are the recent stock price swoons among even some of the most respected traditional retailers.\n\nAMZN data by YCharts\n\nThe message is clear: In a world dominated by Amazon , many other retailers are in a struggle for survival. And as its competitors fade away, Amazon stands to claim the spoils.\n\n6. Growth of AWS\n\nIncredibly, Amazon has another business that may prove to be even more valuable than its core online retail operations. Amazon Web Services has quickly become the dominant provider of scalable cloud computing services, with an estimated 31% share of the global cloud infrastructure market, according to Synergy Research Group. AWS has a massive market opportunity -- so large, in fact, that Amazon's management believes it could eventually rival the company's retail operations in size . The business is already making progress in that regard, with AWS' revenue surging 55% year over year to $3.2 billion in the third quarter. AWS is also highly profitable, with Q3 operating margins of more than 26%. Best of all, AWS has just barely scratched the surface of its potential, and it should continue to turbocharge Amazon's revenue and earnings growth for many years to come.\n\n7. Relentless innovation\n\nMost businesses can only dream of having growth drivers as powerful as AWS and Amazon's online retail operations. Yet even with these potent catalysts well in tow, CEO Jeff Bezos refuses to allow the company he founded to rest on its laurels. Instead, he tenaciously demands that Amazon continue to push the envelope. This focus on innovation has Amazon well positioned to disrupt multiple sectors, such as groceries , home automation , and even package delivery via its drone initiative.\n\nEntrance into these massive industries expands Amazon's total addressable market opportunity by hundreds of billions of dollars. And as Amazon has proven time and again, when it enters a new market, it is not to be taken lightly. As Bezos' juggernaut relentlessly expands its beachheads in these areas in the coming years, Amazon should continue to reward its investors with market-crushing gains.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon.com\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Developed in partnership with Ainemo, a hardware technology company in China, this assistant will allow users to use video chat, play music and request on-demand services such as buying movie tickets or controlling smart home devices. This product is similar to Amazon's Alexa and Google Home virtual assistant. However, given that these companies are currently focused on the U.S. and Baidu is developing this family robot for China, we believe the company can get an early mover's advantage in the Chinese home assistant market. The intelligent virtual assistant market size is expected to exceed $ 11 billion by 2024 , according to a research by Global Market Insights, Inc. While use of robots in industries is becoming common in China, the home robot market is still at a nascent stage. Through its latest venture, Baidu is ensuring that it gets a strong holding in this market with an early mover's advantage.\n\nChina's Smart Home Market Likely To Reach $23 Billion By 2018\n\nAccording to a recent report, the smart home market in China holds strong potential and is likely to reach $23 billion by 2018. While international players are yet to enter the region, local companies are already developing products to attract technology savvy Chinese consumers. A product similar to Amazon's Echo was launched by Beijing's Ling Long Co., which is a joint venture between JD.com and iFlyteck. Building a voice-based virtual assistant is challenging in China, given the dialects and accents associated with the Mandarin language. However, Baidu might be able to handle this challenge better with its focus on artificial intelligence. Baidu's Deep Speech 2 has superior voice recognition abilities as it leverages the power of cloud computing and machine learning to create a neural network. In simple terms, neural networks are machines that learn and this technology works well in solving the challenge of voice recognition when the language has several dialects and accents. With this advanced technological capability Baidu will have the edge in the home assistant market and can gain a significant share in this potentially high growth market.\n\nWhether Baidu will expand its \"Little Fish\" outside of China remains to be seen. However, it is well poised to capture the Chinese home automation/voice based personal assistant market.\n\nView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):\n\nGlobal Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap\n\nMore Trefis Research", "Among the underlying components of the S&P 500 index, we saw noteworthy options trading volume today in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

In 2012, GOOG stock went up by single digits but then in 2013 it gained almost 60%. Then in 2014, what was then Google stock lost about 3% before gaining another 44% again in 2015 after changing its name to Alphabet along the way.\n\nSource: Travis Wise via Flickr\n\nIn 2016, Alphabet Inc. was up by about 8% to lag the overall stock market. So will the past trend hold, and will 2017 be a breakout year?\n\nThere are fair arguments on both sides. After all, the high-growth days of Google are behind it after the internet giant has matured to a nearly $600 billion company. Also, rival Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) is now its peer in both its reach and its relationship with digital advertisers. On the other hand, bulls who like GOOG stock or GOOGL like its track record of consistent growth and innovation over the years.\n\nSo who's right? Here's a look at both sides of the trade with three pros and three cons to investing in Alphabet stock right now.\n\nPros of GOOG Stock\n\nGrowth : While the company restructured into Alphabet in 2015, Google advertising remains the biggest part of its business. And that business is good, judging by overall revenue growth of 19% this year and a projected 16% growth rate next year. Furthermore, profits will be up 16% this year and 19% next year. With continued success from its core, Alphabet can afford to look into new efforts without worrying about financial performance.\n\nValuation : Despite a strong history of success and projections of future growth, GOOG stock is not overvalued. Right now, shares trade for around 20 times forward earnings. That is on par with forward P/E of about 19 for the typical stock in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 . If you can get a fair price for a high-growth company like this, you should take it.\n\nInnovation: With a fair current price and hopes of future growth, there's a lot to like about Alphabet Inc. right now. But with constant innovation into new areas, including a \"smart\" contact lens that can read your blood sugar or Google Fiber high-speed internet access, there is a whole lot of future potential from GOOG stock.\n\nTo keep reading and get 3 reasons to steer clear of Alphabet stock, click here or use the navigation below.\n\n\n\nCons of GOOG Stock\n\nInvestors Still Waiting for Next Big Thing : In a 2016 research report, Bernstein's Carlos Kirjner pointed out that Alphabet's average return on invested capital \"has declined steadily for the last 4-5 years\" as the product pipeline has failed to yield the big success of past years. Yes, Alphabet is trying to innovate with things like self-driving cars … but Uber is standing toe-to-toe with it anyway. Yes, Google is pushing a subscription based YouTube Red … but it's late to the game, behind Netflix, Inc . (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) with its Prime Instant Video offerings. Investors waiting for the next big thing, then, may have to wait for some time.\n\nOver-reliance on Google: While Google ad revenue is looking good right now, there is a big risk in parent Alphabet Inc relying on this unit for literally 99% of its revenue and 100% of its profits. When you take this over-reliance alongside the lack of \"other bets\" paying off and the declining return on invested capital, the future doesn't look quite as rosy for GOOG stock.\n\nUnrealistic Earnings Expectations : Perhaps most damningly in the short-term, the company posted very strong quarterly earnings back in October 2016. However, despite beating on both the top line and the bottom line, shares actually dropped 5% across the next 30 days even as the broader stock market went on a tear in November. As we approach another important earnings report, remember this performance because it could hint that investors are bidding up Alphabet Inc now but expecting to promptly sell it after the latest numbers hit Wall Street.\n\nJeff Reeves is the editor of InvestorPlace.com and the author of The Frugal Investor's Guide to Finding Great Stocks .

FB practically redefined the term \"social media,\" and set the benchmark for digital networking. Today, if you don't have a Facebook account, you might as well not exist. Roughly a quarter of the global population actively uses its services on a monthly basis, making Facebook stock perhaps the most visible investment ever.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nYet based on the FB stock price, the good times may be coming to an end - or at least a definite respite. It's not that there's anything disastrously wrong right now. Facebook stock ended the year up nearly 11%.\n\nThe company is backed by very strong financials that are the envy of the internet content market. Among the highlights are explosive growth in both the top and bottom line. You couldn't get tighter financials if you tried, but somehow, Wall Street is seemingly unimpressed.\n\nThe problem is capital growth. While FB stock produced double-digit returns for the fourth consecutive year - something that the other \"FANG\" stocks Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) can't say - momentum has slowed down substantially. As a prime example, the boring as cornflakes SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA: SPY ) ended 2016 up over 14%. And since the first of November, Facebook stock is down 5%.\n\nFB Stock Is Too Strong to Fail\n\nObviously, no asset can sprint indefinitely. Corrections are a natural component of a healthy bull market, which implies great things for the future of Facebook stock.\n\nInvestorPlace feature writer Hilary Kramer nails down the optimistic argument. In her late-December article, she notes that revenue \"is on tap to expand by more than 50% this year, translating to more than 80% earnings growth . Earnings estimates for Facebook stock have been marching steadily higher - always a good sign.\" Despite controversies surrounding the FB decision to crack down on \"fake news,\" nothing can upend these enormously positive tailwinds.\n\nEven if conservative users are unhappy - suspicious stories' provenance will be determined by left-leaning media like The Associated Press and The Washington Post - FB stock has one, undeniable trump card. Everybody loves Facebook, and that won't change. Because of this rabid popularity, the company can look forward to continued growth without worry.\n\nAnother highly respected voice from InvestorPlace, Lawrence Meyers, concurs. A begrudging analyst towards FB stock, even he admits the financials are fantastic. Meyers writes, \"It has also proven to be a very effective advertising platform , with revenue from each user globally increasing at a rate of almost 40%. That's just incredible. If you crunch all the other data, I see nothing but good news, as we see increasing user engagement and increasing advertiser spend per user.\"\n\nDon't Ignore the Warning Signs for Facebook Stock\n\nYet the question remains - why hasn't Facebook stock picked up on the enormously bullish fundamentals? I think there's more going on than just \"people don't get it.\"\n\nIn its first full year as a publicly traded entity, FB stock returned a whopping 110%. The following year in 2014, shareholders were rewarded with a robust 41% return; 2015 hit a very mild road bump, netting investors more than 30%. But at 13% in 2016, that's a severe demarcation. Again, you could get better performance blindly picking a basket of companies from the S&P 500 .\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nBut the biggest concern from a nearer-term perspective is the technical warning signs. Ever since a steep drop off on Nov. 3, Facebook stock has formed a bearish pennant formation . This chart pattern is characterized by a sideways consolidation period, followed by a continuation of pessimism.\n\nIndeed, we've already witnessed the impact of bad news towards FB stock. Currently, traders are digesting the overall situation in the markets to determine their next move.\n\nBut this \"digesting process\" implies more downside risk yet to be absorbed. Keep in mind that it doesn't necessarily have to be bad news - Facebook stock may simply fail to meet lofty expectations.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind, however, that this is an immediate assessment. Like many others have pointed out, Facebook stock is built upon a solid foundation. I would be surprised if this is anything more than a blip lasting at longest a quarter or two.\n\nFor those wanting to get on board with FB stock, the best idea here is to wait a little bit. This is an important transitory period for Facebook, which could spell a solid discount for patient buyers.\n\nAs of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Is Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Finally Tripping Up in the Markets? appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "New Purchases: ADBE , COH , BDX , PWR, PH, FOXA, KLAC, NFLX, GLW, RF,\n\nAdded Positions:BAC, UNH, ABBV, GE, BCR, BRK.B, MSFT, CMCSA, FB, VZ,\n\nReduced Positions:SYK, NVDA, JNJ, AMZN, PEP, KMB, PG, CL, AMGN, DIS,\n\nSold Out:LOW, UPS, VMC, CRM, GIS, FSLR, IFF, LLY, WFC, JPM,\n\nFor the details of Centre Asset Management, LLC's stock buys and sells, go to http://www.gurufocus.com/StockBuy.php?GuruName=Centre+Asset+Management%2C+LLC\n\nApple Inc ( AAPL ) - 225,638 shares, 5.08% of the total portfolio.

The next major catalyst for the stock is likely to be the earnings announcement on Jan. 26. And looked at through the lens of technical analysis, GOOGL stock is giving us some well-defined price levels to focus around.\n\nWhen I last discussed Alphabet stock on Dec. 6, I offered that GOOGL could see a pop off important technical support and possibly into year-end for a Santa Claus rally. The very next day, shares took another leg up and reached my near-term price target around $820 just five trading days later.\n\nI still view the month of January to potentially be a tale of two different types of markets. While the first week of 2017 saw a further spillover effect of the late 2016 \"Trump Bump,\" the second half of January will bring about a heavier corporate earnings calendar as well as the presidential inauguration.\n\nObviously, it is too early to tell how markets will react to these events, but given the sharp rally we have witnessed in stocks over the past two weeks, I don't think it's farfetched to expected at least a little cool-down in stocks over the near- to possibly intermediate-term future.\n\nAnd GOOGL stock could be one of the victims here.\n\nGOOGL Stock Charts\n\nIf we look at the multiyear weekly chart of GOOGL stock, we see that the uptrend in a well-defined pattern (red dotted parallels) remains intact.\n\nHowever, we also see that shares are now again trading near the very upper end of this channel.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nBroadly speaking, stocks tend not to break out of these longer-term uptrending channels for very long before mean-reverting back in. While a breakout of this channel to the upside is certainly not out of question, a successful breakout likely needs a major news catalyst … such as potentially a great earnings and outlook report by Alphabet on Jan. 26.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nOn the daily chart, we see the bullish reversal that took place in early November and again in early December, which in early December got me to buy the stock for a trade, as discussed above. The technical confluence zone of support around the $750 area remains important through a multiweek/multimonth lens, just as horizontal resistance around the $820 area is important.\n\nLast Friday, GOOGL stock rallied about 1.5% and closed the day and week above $820. If momentum can sustain, then the stock should see $845-$850 before the Jan. 26 earnings report.\n\nFrom my perspective, I will not be in GOOGL through the earnings report. Instead, I believe the best way to approach Alphabet is to re-evaluate the stock after earnings have passed.\n\nLike what you see?

For its first demonstration, it had various extreme-sports athletes wear the head-mounted device while on a live Google Hangout video chat with Google co-founder Sergey Brin, and it had the tech world buzzing with anticipation. But within two years of launching the product, Google shut down Glass.\n\nConversely, Snapchat parent company Snap has used guerrilla marketing tactics to generate strong interest in its Spectacles -- a pair of sunglasses that double as a camera linked to Snapchat. The company randomly drops a giant vending machine in a city, and people line up for hours to get their hands on the $130 device. Others have spent well over the retail price to buy a secondhand pair online.\n\nSnap has done what the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company could not. It has made it cool to wear technology on your face. While Snap hasn't released any numbers about Spectacles sales, the above-retail pricing on eBay and lines at the vending machines indicates that they're popular.\n\nBut it's not just clever marketing that's made Spectacles a hit. It's their specificity, and that can tell us a lot about the rest of the wearables market, too.\n\nWhat do you do with these things?\n\nGoogle Glass was a powerful device capable of doing a whole lot. The biggest problem it faced was that just because it could do something -- like provide weather data, set reminders, and dictate texts -- didn't mean people would want to use it for that. A regular smartphone worked just as well.\n\nGoogle Glass lacked a specific purpose. Even Google's live demo at its announcement with the extreme-sports athletes could have been done better with GoPro cameras. Instead, Google provided a platform and asked developers to come up with a reason you'd want to wear Glass on your face all the time.\n\nThere's no question why you'd buy a pair of Spectacles. You want to share more photos and videos with Snapchat's 150 million daily users; that's all they do.\n\nSpectacles are quicker and easier to use for recording short snaps, especially while performing actions requiring the use of both hands or when you want to capture unplanned events in the moment. Fishing your phone out and loading the Snapchat app can take a long time. Spectacles are also capable of capturing video in Snap's new circular video format, which mimics human perspective.\n\nThat specific, limited purpose allows Snap to sell them at an affordable price point. Spectacles cost just $130 compared to the $1,500 Google asked for a Glass unit.\n\nThe end result is a face wearable that feels more like a toy than the high-end technology of Google Glass. And that's a good thing. People buy toys somewhat impulsively, but they consider their options more carefully when buying a new computer, phone, television, or other piece of technology. As they should. Those things generally cost a lot more than toys.\n\nThe same principle applies to wrist wearables\n\nThis theory also apples to other types of wearables. Fitbit (NYSE: FIT) was once again the most popular wearable brand in 2016 and most of its wristbands are considered low-end fitness trackers. Its average sales price last quarter was $93. That's a price where consumers are willing to give the product a try and play around with it. It's a toy.\n\nComparatively, the Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Watch starts at $269, with prices climbing above $1,000. While the device is certainly more powerful than a Fitbit and has the potential to do a lot more, the best ideas Apple can come up with for uses are to track your fitness. In fact, its latest update focused specifically on new fitness-tracking functionality such as making it waterproof so it can track swimming activities.\n\nWhy would you buy an Apple Watch if all you need is a fitness tracker? Why would you buy Google Glass when all you want to do is share videos and photos with your friends? Making a device for a specific use is not only cheaper, it makes the marketing and messaging clearer for consumers. That's evidenced in the fact that fitness bands accounted for 85% of wearable sales last quarter, according to IDC.\n\nThat's the problem Apple currently faces with the Apple Watch. It can tout all of the technology it's stuffed inside that little wrist-worn device, but it can't give consumers a reason to buy it over one of its competitors.\n\nThere will surely be a market for Apple's high-end device simply because of its brand and strong design aesthetic. But until Apple can provide a differentiating function over its lower-end competitors, its sales will continue to lag Fitbit and other low-end device makers. That could be cellular connectivity, making the devices more independent. It could come from enterprise support. And Apple has done a good enough job getting the device onto the wrists of millions that there's relatively strong developer support. So, it could come from a third-party application.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Nasdaq recently reached out to Swan (Philosophy and Economic Theory, New School, New York) to explore what that might mean to investors.\n\nOn the first day of 2017, the U.S. dollar exchange rate of bitcoin passed the “magic” threshold of $1,000, exciting Bitcoin enthusiasts worldwide. Bitcoin, the value of which more than doubled in 2016, was one of the best investments of the year, and the best-performing currency.\n\nOne explanation for the sustained rise of Bitcoin in 2016 could be fear of capital controls in countries like India and China, exacerbated by political uncertainties such as Brexit and the rise of anti-establishment political parties in most of Europe, as well as the election in the U.S. of Donald Trump. But another reason for the rise can be traced to the growing — or, rather, exploding — popularity of blockchain technologies that power Bitcoin and other digital currency platforms such as Ethereum.\n\n“The blockchain,” a generic term for all cryptographic distributed ledgers like Bitcoin and Ethereum, seems poised to revolutionize the banking and financial services sector, which explains why nearly all major banks, and even central banks and national governments, are taking an active role.\n\nBut blockchain technologies are also likely to have a strong impact on futuristic, disruptive technologies that are expected to emerge in the next decade, such as supercomputing; artificial intelligence (AI), with applications ranging from self-driving cars to big data analysis for personalized medicine; and advanced medical nanorobotics, tiny devices expected to start policing our bodies and ridding us of pathogens and rogue cancer cells before the end of the 2020s.\n\nAll that potential is likely to interest forward-looking investors, from wealthy and institutional players to small investors who want to assemble a public stock portfolio oriented toward long-term growth. But how can investors plan for a blockchain-related future?\n\nSwan has built her reputation as a guiding light through these uncharted waters. She founded the Institute for Blockchain Studies to examine the theoretical, philosophical and societal implications of blockchain technology, and is the author of “Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy” (2015), a book dedicated to advanced future applications of distributed ledger technology beyond currency (“Blockchain 1.0”) and smart contracts (“Blockchain 2.0”). Swan’s book, which stands out for its unusually extensive coverage of advanced emerging applications, is a worthwhile read for all technology enthusiasts, analysts and investors.\n\n“Blockchain technology is not necessarily the ‘Newest Latest Thing,’ but it is an idea whose development is quietly underway in the trenches,” Swan told Nasdaq. “While Bitcoin and blockchain technology might not be the final solutions, it is clear that secure value transfer via networks is a crucial near-future technology.”\n\nThere is one blockchain technology that stands out, according to Swan.\n\n“Identity [blockchain-based identity management systems] is one killer app now in development for next-generation blockchain technology,” she said. “Having standard mechanisms for confirming digital identity is a necessary infrastructural piece for operations such as affirming asset ownership, implementing electronic medical records, and transferring inventories.”\n\nIn fact, identity management is a necessary component of most innovative blockchain-based solutions under development.\n\n“The sectors most likely to be impacted by blockchain technology in the next decade are financial services, supply chain and logistics, energy, healthcare and Internet of Things [IoT],” continued Swan. “Establishing core functionality such as identity confirmation and activity verification — for example, shipment delivery and contents — could see rapid implementation and pave the way for higher-level features such as outright asset transfer.”\n\nThe AI technologies that are expected to come out of research labs and play a disruptive role in the real world in only a few years are likely to leverage blockchain technologies for internal operational coordination and interactions with the external world.\n\n“Blockchain technology is a secure automation system for managing and tracking arbitrarily large numbers of items and transactions, which implies that a massive new scale of automated operations could be possible,” explained Swan. “Further, blockchains enact smart networks that enforce good-player behavior via consensus, which suggests that humans and AI [intelligent agents] could interact trustfully on the same networks.”\n\n\"More advanced applications include ideas like the Bio-Cryptoeconomy: Nanorobotic DACs [Distributed Autonomous Corporations] for Cell Repair and Enhancement, using blockchains to coordinate the in-body activity of medical nanorobots,” concluded Swan. “Medical nanorobots are tiny robotic machines at the nanoscale roving within the human body to perform a variety of health and enhancement operations.\n\n“While autonomous nanomachines are not imminent, already nanoparticles are being deployed clinically in the human body for dynamically controllable drug delivery and other functions,” Swan said, noting that, in the longer-term future, fleets of medical nanorobots might be brought on board the human body for a variety of pathology resolution and enhancement activities.\n\n“Since blockchain technology is a next-generation internet functionality allowing secure value transfer over networks, companies standing to profit the most from this first could be good investments, such as financial services and technology companies,” Swan advises investors. “A higher risk way to gain exposure would be by investing in blockchain technology companies as they launch initial public offerings in the future, or in private equity funds focusing on the sector.\n\nA number of companies and ongoing projects are following the directives identified above. Microsoft is developing a blockchain-based identity system that allows people, products, apps and services to interoperate across blockchains, cloud providers and organizations. Many companies are developing preliminary blockchain-based applications for the healthcare sector, starting small but with the potential to contribute to next-generation personalized medicine systems.\n\nIBM is integrating blockchain technology with its Watson AI and IoT projects. Mesh networks of smart sensors for industrial applications, developed by blockchain-oriented IoT startups in collaboration with tech titans like IBM, could prepare the way for Google’s bio-molecular nanotechnology projects.\n\nAs with any investment, close investigation and risk assessment is always advised and no single investment is right for everyone. The companies and projects mentioned in this article are only a few examples among many driving a changing landscape. But Swan’s glimpse of the future can be helpful as one piece of the informational puzzle for those who want to learn more about the imminent blockchain revolution.", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTwitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) reports quarterly numbers again in the beginning of February. Based on past Twitter earnings reports, investors shouldn't expect much to change.\n\nSource: WEnet Studio Via Stock Snap\n\nThat could either be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your perspective.\n\nTWTR stock saw a big drop across the end of 2015 and into January 2016. Then, the social media darling bounced around mostly between $15 and $20 or so for the rest of the year. With shares of Twitter stock under $17 once again, now could be a good buying opportunity. Simply getting back to $20 would be a quick 15% or 20% gain.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting Twitter has declined almost 10% since Election Day even as the broader stock market has gained about 10% to the upside. That kind of slide needs to quickly be stopped before the social media company finds itself setting new lows and being left in the dust of this rally.\n\nThe million-dollar question, then, is should you buy Twitter Inc. stock now? Here are three pros and three cons to explain both sides of the trade:\n\nPros of Buying Twitter Stock\n\nBuyout Potential: While TWTR stock was stuck mostly between $15 and $20 in 2016, shares did surge to a high of over $25 in October on rumors of a buyout . Potential acquirers included Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE: CRM ), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and even Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS ). All it takes is one juicy offer - or even hints of one - and Twitter stock will take off.\n\nVideo Potential : If you hadn't heard, last year Twitter embarked on an ambitious partnership with the NFL . The deal allowed the social media company to offer live, streaming video of pro football games. Reports around the first such game in September showed 2 million people checked out the stream, and that bodes very well for future efforts - and future advertising revenue for TWTR stock.\n\nStrong Leadership: Co-founder Jack Dorsey returned to the company as CEO at the end of 2015. Since then, he has made tough decisions to contain costs, including layoffs, as well as engaging directly with Twitter users about what's wrong with the platform. As one of the founding fathers, Dorsey has what it takes to make the hard changes TWTR needs to grow in 2017 and beyond.\n\nTo keep reading and get 3 reasons to steer clear of Twitter stock, click here or use the navigation below.\n\nCons of Buying Twitter Stock\n\nNo Profits: Of course, one of the biggest challenges both to CEO Jack Dorsey and to any potential acquirers is that Twitter remains unprofitable and has no hope of turning that around anytime soon. Consider that in Q3, revenue grew 8%, but TWTR stock also saw its cost of revenue grow more than 12%. That's not a recipe for success.\n\nNo User Growth: Monthly active users have all but flatlined, growing a measly 3% year-over-year in Q3. Worse, the most valuable segment of users in the U.S. is stuck at 67 million users - a measly 1 million more than the 66 million users recorded almost two years ago in Q1 2015. That's also not a recipe for success.\n\nIt's Not Facebook: The sad reality is that internet advertisers don't split up their spending evenly among various platforms. They tend to pick one and stick with it - and those platforms are either Google or Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) because both offer sophisticated targeting and massive scale. Twitter simply can't compete with that, and won't be able to land the big advertising deals these other digital advertisers can.\n\nJeff Reeves is the editor of InvestorPlace.com and the author of The Frugal Investor's Guide to Finding Great Stocks .

With its latest announcement, it's taking a different path than it has in the past, but it's one that could be a winning strategy.\n\nAt the start of CES 2017, Amazon and its hardware partners, Seiki, Westinghouse and Element Electronics announced the first set of 4K TV sets that will incorporate elements of the Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Alexa -- the company's artificial intelligence platform.\n\nThe TVs will range between 43 and 65 inches, come with a 4K resolution, 3GB of RAM and 16GB internal memory for apps. They'll also come with a remote control that has a built-in microphone that lets the user speak directly into it, and doubles as a direct line to Amazon’s digital assistant, Alexa.\n\nSo far, no prices have been announced, but the companies said that the sets would be available on Amazon as well as various retail partners.\n\nThe main difference this time around when compared to what Amazon has done in the past is that it's not responsible for the hardware, but just the software.\n\nBefore this, Amazon built and owned the hardware, like with the actual Fire TV set-top box, Fire tablets, the Amazon Echo, Kindle e-readers and the forgettable Fire phone, to name a few. Unlike phones or even tablets, the television business is largely a low-margin business with little turnover. People aren't buying TVs every two or three years. And with prices dropping drastically (4K TVs can be bought for well under $1,000 now), there isn't exactly a lot of opportunity to sell premium-priced products at a rapid clip.\n\nWith Amazon providing the software, it allows them to get the Fire OS and Alexa into the hands of many more people. Not everyone is a tech whiz and perhaps they can't be bothered connecting a set-top box or a connected speaker to a home entertainment system.\n\nBut with Seiki, Westinghouse and Element Electronics building the hardware, and Amazon worrying about the software, it doesn't have to worry about how many units it's sold or how much revenue it makes from the sales. This is essentially a marketing opportunity to show off Amazon's software capabilities and keep people inside the Amazon ecosystem, much like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL) want to keep people inside the Android and iOS ecosystems, respectively.\n\nIt also helps keep Amazon Prime Video at the forefront of consumer's minds, which may wind up being a bigger revenue driver for the company than some on Wall Street think.\n\nAmazon has worked hard to build up its content on Prime Video, with originals like Man in the High Castle or Goliath, as well as acquiring TV shows and movies from other content companies to beef up its offerings to compete with Hulu, Netflix (NFLX) and others in the space. Amazon's recent announcement that it would be rolling out Prime Video to more than 200 countries is another sign that it's not just a add-on feature for Prime, but a part of a strategy to own everything a consumer does.\n\nBy having Fire OS and Amazon Alexa on hardware that doesn't need to be purchased every two or three years, Amazon gets the benefit of being a player in the TV market without the worries. It sounds like a win-win for Amazon and ultimately, its shareholders.", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGood news for those of you who like, and use, the 1-click purchase tool provided by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) - the company's patent on the utility is set to expire this year, meaning other companies will soon be able to make it super-easy to buy pretty much anything on the web.\n\nSource: Via Amazon\n\nIt's superficially bad news for owners of AMZN stock, of course, as the tool facilitated revenue that may not have otherwise materialized if a shopper was forced to work through a two-stage (or more) process to make said purchase.\n\nAlthough no empirical evidence of the benefit of 1-click has been offered, many say the technology has facilitated billions of dollars worth of incrementally more business for the e-commerce giant.\n\nThat said, while Amazon's impending loss of patent protection on the business process could be troubling to AMZN stock owners, a closer, critical look at 1-click suggests it's not just the function/feature that kept Amazon.com's digital competitors at a disadvantage.\n\nAMZN: E-commerce Made Easy\n\nThe value of 1-click is mostly an arbitrary one. A few years back CEO and Co-Founder of Rejoiner Mike Arsenault used a working figure that suggested the technology was responsible for 5% of the company's sales, while Forbes contributor Ian Morris recently came up with a more specific suggested value of $2.4 billion.\n\nAlthough there's no great way of quantifying its value and impact, the patent does lend itself to a qualified assessment.\n\nAnyone who has ever made a purchase of any kind on the web knows it can be a bit of a pain. Not only must payment details be entered at the time of purchase, but shipping instructions must also be added. Too much hassle during the procedure (called \"friction\"), and would-customers abandon their efforts to buy something online before the transaction is completed. Specifically, a collection of tech companies estimate the \"abandoned\" web-based shopping-cart rate to be about 68%.\n\nWhat if, however, a consumer could simply click one button in their browser, and boom - it's done? That's what 1-click does.\n\nAnd it matters, if the rise of the iTunes store from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is any indication.\n\nThe growth of iTunes has largely been credited to its license to use Amazon's 1-click platform. Steve Jobs knew years ago the key to the digital content site's success was making it stunningly easy for consumers to spend. Apple licensed Amazon's technology in 2000, after the patent was issued to Amazon in 1999, and saw its digital content business soar from practically nothing to a $6.3 billion business by 2011 .\n\nSure, the advent of the iPhone helped, but one could argue that 1-click also helped popularize the iPhone as a way to consume digital content.\n\nThere's a subtle-but-significant fly in the ointment of the theory that Amazon's smashing success relied on 1-click and that competitors will eat its lunch once its patent protection is gone, however. AMZN stock owners should be thrilled.\n\n1-Click Is Only Part of the Amazon Stock Success Story\n\nAs difficult as it may be to determine how much of the 4,800% gain Amazon stock has dished out since the end of 2000 is solely attributable to 1-click, it would be short-sighted to ignore another key fact of the matter. That is, all of those users were or became AMZN customers for reasons other than 1-click.\n\nGiving credit where it's due, it was Econsultancy's David Moth who recognized years ago that easy online payments was only one pillar in Amazon's growth, particularly after mobile became the new norm.\n\nFor starters, Moth points out that AMZN was one of the first major names to develop a mobile-specific e-commerce website, syncing that shopping cart up with the same user's desktop shopping-cart (if logged in at the same time). He also recognized - and this is big - that Amazon's call-to-action screens are simply more compelling than its competitors' pages.\n\nPerhaps the most significant factor of all, though, is that Amazon actually sells almost any product you can think of , making it easy to seamlessly connect the order for merchandise and the payment for it. PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL ) was and still is only a middleman. Ditto for Apple Pay. Even if other tech companies deploy a 1-click alternative of their own, they're still relying on a third-party to supply and ship goods. Never even mind the fact that Amazon was only granted patent protection for 1-click in the United States. Its requests for patents in other nations were rejected, but that didn't prevent the e-commerce outfit from becoming a force in those markets.\n\nBottom Line for AMZN Stock\n\nIn other words, Amazon stock is still going to be the king of e-commerce, as it has already won the hearts and minds of more consumers than its competition has.\n\nOther players are apt to unveil similar tools in the foreseeable future, but with the exception of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) leveraging product-based searches initiated via the Google search engine, those other companies are still going to struggle to take market share back from Amazon. Even then, Alphabet is years - and miles - behind AMZN stock on the e-tailing front.\n\nAs of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Amazon.com, Inc.'s (AMZN) 1-Click Patent Loss Is Just a Flesh Wound appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMy preconceived notion when putting this piece together was that demand for Fitbit Inc's (NYSE: FIT ) wearable fitness devices and accessories have peaked for good and that Fitbit stock, which was down sharply throughout most of 2016, had little investment appeal. Yet sales should be up this year, and FIT is optimistic for its sales levels during this all-important holiday season.\n\nSource: Via Fitbit\n\nIt also seems logical that consumers will eventually ditch wearable devices and turn to apps in their mobile devices.\n\nIn theory, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) should be able to put Fitbit out of business. Yet, there appears to be a select group that is interested in daily fitness, and athletes will likely always be interested in any information that helps them perform best and compete at a high level.\n\nIs It All Bad News for Fitbit Stock?\n\nFIT is also developing products for what it terms a healthcare ecosystem. In its words , it aims to \"comprehensively monitor and effectively engage patients and consumers to drive better health outcomes.\" Health and fitness tracking is likely to remain as important as ever, and could develop into a multi-billion dollar business for wearable device firms such as FIT.\n\nCash flow trends aren't encouraging at all. In 2016 (through Sept. 30), Fitbit has been a net spender of its cash. By this period in 2015, it had generated $125.5 million in operating cash flow and only spent $17.7 million on capital expenditure. This year operating cash flow only totaled $40.2 million and capex had grown to $66.8 million, meaning negative free cash flow.\n\nYet management expects a healthy holiday season to bring in sales and profits and boost total cash on hand from about $672 million currently to between $900 million and $950 million by the end of the first quarter of 2017. This is when all the cash will come in from the holiday sales. That could bring total cash to nearly $4 per diluted share, or just over half of the current share price of $7.95 per share.\n\nFor the full year, sales are expected to grow as much as 26% to $2.3 billion. This is based off the 20 analysts currently following Fitbit stock. This group expects a modest 3% boost to $2.4 billion during 2017, but that is subject to change. Earnings estimates for FIT stock are at $0.58 per share this year, and $0.66 next year.\n\nThe problem with earnings is forecasts have come down significantly. Just 90 days ago, analysts expected earnings of well over $1 per share for each of the next two years. Based on the decreases, there is little surprise Fitbit stock has fallen from $30 per share to the single-digit level currently.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Apple, or Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android platform will develop apps that increasingly compete with Fitbit's wearable devices. It is clearly more convenient to carry one device over two, though highly active people don't probably carry a phone while working out. Yet, more advanced data from wearable fitness devices could grow much more specialized than what a phone can provide.\n\nWith FIT stock's current price and valuation (less than 13x earnings estimates), because of the share-price fall, the company's investment picture is now quite interesting. It has no long-term debt, so it is in a great financial position. Fitbit stock is still generating cash flow and profits. In its recent earnings call, management touted that it has sold 28 million devices since going public and $2.7 billion in sales.\n\nFIT also mentioned , \"healthcare and insurance industries are starting to embrace our products and services.\" To me, this is the real potential in Fitbit stock. Earlier in December, FIT and medical device giant Medtronic PLC (NYSE: MDT ) announced a partnership to track the glucose levels of patients with diabetes. Medtronic's iPro2 CGM device will integrate data from Fitbit's activity devices.\n\nThe Bottom Line on FIT Stock\n\nOf course, it is going to take time for any tangible results from the healthcare and insurance initiatives to take hold. For the time being, consumer demand for Fitbit devices appears to be tepid at best. Management is working through some higher inventory levels, and it appears that existing sales are much less profitable than they were several years ago for FIT stock.\n\nFor now, Fitbit stock investors might want to wait for the sales results from Black Friday, the Christmas shopping season and the promotional period following the holidays. However the share price is low, and there aren't really any ambitious growth levels baked into FIT stock.\n\nIt might not be a bad strategy to nibble into Fitbit stock at current levels, and average in if sales come in weak from the holidays and the share price falls any further. But regardless of the short-term strategy, an investment in FIT stock will require a long-term perspective, to see if it is able to profitability deliver on its mission of helping \"people lead healthier lives by empowering them with data, inspiration and guidance.\"\n\nAs of this writing, Ryan Fuhrmann did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is a Zombie, But the Cure Is Coming appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPaypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL ) got some good news to start off the New Year.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnalysts at Monness Crespi Hardt published an upbeat report, indicating: \"We've wanted to turn positive on PayPal for a while.\" The firm now has a $50 price target on PayPal stock, which means there is a potential 24% upside.\n\nBut this was not the only positive report. Goldman Sachs also put PayPal stock on its conviction list , along with other mega internet companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ).\n\nWhy the bullishness? First of all, the holiday season was a clear example that consumers increasingly use their smartphones as wallets. According to research from Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ: ADBE ), the sales came to a hefty $24 billion (from Nov. 1 to Dec. 20), representing 31% of all online retail sales. This is up from just 19% in 2014. By 2020, Business Intelligence predicts that mobile will come to 45% of the $632 billion total in e-commerce sales.\n\nWhile mobile commerce is far from easy, this is a big-time opportunity for PayPal. The company has spent years developing intuitive mobile apps for streamlining the purchase process, utilizing features such as Touch ID from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Order Ahead. But PayPal stock has also been customer-focused by allowing various payment types like Visa Inc (NYSE: V ) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA ).\n\nWhat's more, the company has leveraged its platform to provide comprehensive merchant services. In the latest quarter, the business reported a 34% jump in payments volume to $73 billion . Just some of the marquee customers include Uber, Airbnb and Pinterest .\n\nOf course, a critical part of the strategy - which has certainly helped PayPal stock - is the savvy dealmaking. One example is the acquisition of Xoom, which allows people to easily send payments to 56 countries. It's essentially a new-fangled version of The Western Union Company (NYSE: WU ) and Moneygram International Inc (NASDAQ: MGI ). Keep in mind that the market opportunity is a whopping $600 billion .\n\nBut for holders of PayPal stock, the most attractive gem is the wildly popular Venmo app, which has become a must-have for millennials. A key has been capitalizing social features (such as sharing purchases with friends) and integrations, like allowing Apple users to pay with Siri.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, Venmo processed $4.9 billion in transaction volume , up a sizzling 131% on a year-over-year basis. The run-rate is near $20 billion.\n\nBottom Line on PayPal Stock\n\nCurrently, there are 192 million active customer accounts, up about 19 million during the past 12 months. And growth is expected to continue. PYPL projects that the top-line will increase at 16% to 17% for the next three years.\n\nOh, and the company remains a high-margin operator. During Q3 , PYPL posted $801 million in operating cash flows. In all, there is $6.4 billion in the bank.\n\nDespite all this, PayPal stock has still been a bit of a laggard. For the past year, the return is about 12%.\n\nBut hey, this means investors have an opportunity to get an affordable play on the mobile revolution. Keep in mind that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is 23, which is reasonable for a growth company. And as noted in the Monness Crespi Hardt report: \"the ability to deliver outsized growth versus peers off this large of a base, while trading at a discount, deserves constructive scrutiny.\"\n\nIndeed.\n\nTom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog IPO Playbook and is a registered investment adviser representative (you can visit his site to learn more about his financial planning services).

FCA has no plans to build it. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.\n\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE: FCAU) has released some information on the Chrysler Portal concept car that it plans to unveil on Tuesday at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Portal is a futuristic take on a highly connected electric minivan. It's an intriguing idea. But it's also a huge missed opportunity -- and a troubling sign for FCA investors.\n\nA potential Tesla competitor, if it were real\n\nFCA said that the Portal \"explores the possibility of what a family transportation vehicle could look like.\" It has some self-driving capabilities, FCA said, and the ability to connect to personal devices and \"the cloud\" in ways that will help to keep the kids entertained on long (or not so long) trips.\n\nFCA said that the Portal has a battery-electric drivetrain with 250 miles of range. Its battery packs are built into the floor, in the style of Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) . Fast-charging capability will be able to add 150 miles of range in about 20 minutes.\n\nSimply put, the Portal represents an intriguing and advanced potential competitor to Tesla's Model X, one that could turn the market for \"kid-hauler\" vehicles on its head.\n\nOr it would, if FCA planned to build it. But the Portal is strictly a show car -- and that's the problem.\n\nThis isn't the electric minivan FCA desperately needs\n\nHere's why it's a problem: The auto industry is changing rapidly, but there are few signs that FCA is taking steps to keep up. This show vehicle doesn't really change that, but an electric vehicle intended for production might have.\n\nRight now, FCA has pickup trucks and Jeep SUVs and Hemi V8s, along with a nice new minivan. (And, to be fair, a brand-new hybrid version of that minivan.) They're popular products and sales have been good. But with no hybrids or electric vehicles to offset them and improve its corporate fuel-economy average, FCA is headed for trouble.\n\nThe Portal's dash is a show-car flight of fancy. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.\n\nFCA does have a deal with Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Waymo self-driving car subsidiary that has produced some self-driving test vehicles and a version of FCA's touchscreen system that integrates the Android operating system. But it's lacking a range of hybrids and a serious electric-car effort as fuel-economy rules tighten -- and that's going to be a big problem in a few years.\n\nThe contrast with FCA's old Detroit rivals is instructive. General Motors (NYSE: GM) has a long-range electric car in production and a massive effort under way to develop self-driving technology in-house. Ford (NYSE: F) also has a big self-driving development effort under way, along with a range of well-regarded hybrids and clear, credible plans to add many more electrified vehicles over the next few years. And both have made it clear that they are grappling seriously with the larger technology-driven changes coming to the business of autos.\n\nChrysler wouldn't have missed this huge opportunity, but FCA did\n\nNot all of the incumbent global automakers will be able to make the leap into the not-too-distant electrified, self-driving, ride-hailing future. Some will be displaced (or \"disrupted\") by new entrants like Tesla and Waymo. It's a good bet that GM and Ford will be important players in that future, because they're taking the steps to get there now. FCA, which is struggling under a huge debt load, hasn't kept up.\n\nA fully electric version of the Chrysler Pacifica would have been a more impressive statement by FCA. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.\n\nAt several points in its long and checkered history, the old Chrysler Corporation was able to dodge corporate death with a brilliant new product at just the right moment. FCA had the opportunity to do that today -- and frankly, when he heard that an electric minivan was in the works, your humble Fool expected a classic Chrysler masterstroke .\n\nImagine if instead of a futuristic concept, FCA had shown a long-range electric version of its current minivan, the gorgeous Chrysler Pacifica -- and had announced plans to put it into production. Sure, it might take a few years and a huge internal effort to bring that vehicle to market, given that FCA is starting from behind. But it would have the potential to be the first electric vehicle that really connects with the mass market: an electric minivan perfect for tech-savvy young families.\n\nAn electric Pacifica would have been a much more powerful statement that FCA sees the future coming and plans to join it in bold style. Instead, it built a vehicle that is just for show, with technology that might or might not actually exist.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) is all-in on the struggling wearables. The company released the Apple Watch Series 2 last September.\n\nSource: Apple\n\nAnd according to a new report out of China, signs indicate AAPL could release a new Apple Watch 3 in the fall of 2017, alongside the highly anticipated iPhone 8.\n\nApple Watch 3 Rumors\n\nNearly a year and a half separated the release of the original Apple Watch and the follow-up Apple Watch Series 2. If AAPL were to follow that pattern, we wouldn't expect to see the Apple Watch 3 until spring 2018. In fact, there's been speculation that Apple would stretch the window between releases even further.\n\nSmartwatches may not have the same upgrade appeal as smartphones do (they're seen as a more functional accessory), so product releases may end up being more widely spaced out. Tepid consumer reaction to the devices just adds more fuel to that fire.\n\nHowever, MacRumors is reporting this morning that China's Economic Daily News published a story confirming that once again Quanta Computer (OTCMKTS: QUCPF ) will be manufacturing the new Apple Watch.\n\nThe trade paper goes further, though, suggesting the new Apple Watch 3 is expected to be unveiled in the third quarter of 2017 .\n\nExpected Apple Watch 3 Features\n\nWith the Apple Watch Series 2, AAPL played it pretty safe. The new smartwatch was virtually identical to the original in appearance. Key upgrades were a faster CPU, a brighter display and built-in GPS.\n\nAccording to the Economic Daily News , Apple will continue to chip away against the primary consumer complaints about smartwatches. The paper says the new Apple Watch will focus mainly on improving battery life. MacRumors also points out other potential features that have been discussed as possibilities for the next version of Apple's wearable. Top on that list are cellular connectivity (added to the GPS feature gained last fall this would make the Apple Watch 3 fully functional without requiring an iPhone on hand), and the switch to microLED display panels, which would shave some of the thickness and weight from current models.\n\nGrim Smartwatch Market Could Heat up in 2017\n\n2016 wasn't exactly a stellar year for the smartwatch industry. Sales through October were down more than 50% compared to the previous year . Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google division decided to delay releasing the next version of its Android Wear smartwatch operating system until 2017. And of course, the big news was the failure of smartwatch pioneer Pebble , which went out with a whimper; it was acquired by Fitbit Inc (NYSE: FIT ), and all of its products were cancelled.\n\nLenovo Group Limited (OTCMKTS: LNVGY ) also decided to hit pause on its popular Moto 360 smartwatch, with that company announcing one of the most popular smartwatches in the Android camp would not be getting an update in 2017 .\n\nIf all that sounds bad for 2017, it's not exactly great news for the smartwatch industry.\n\nHowever … that new version of Android Wear could boost interest and likely will lead to a series of third-party smartwatch releases - even if the Moto 360 is absent. Google also has said it will release its own smartwatch hardware in 2017 , hoping to repeat the splash it made with its Pixel Phone in 2016. And it's always possible that Fitbit might cobble something together with its newly acquired Pebble engineers to release a true fitness smartwatch in 2017.\n\nGiven the potential for compelling new rival devices, a new Apple Watch 3 for 2017 would make sense for AAPL as a defensive strategy, helping to maintain its lead.\n\nApple Watch 3 + iPhone 8 = Maximum Apple\n\nThe other reason why an Apple Watch 3 in 2017 might be a smart move from AAPL's perspective is the iPhone 8.\n\nThis year is expected to be a big one for Apple. The iPhone will be a 10th anniversary release -just in time to fight back against sliding iPhone sales. The iPhone 8 is going to be a huge release for Apple in the fall.\n\nHaving an all-new Apple watch 3 to show off beside it would be a big one-two punch, helping to preserve Apple's smartwatch lead while enticing AAPL fans to spend even more money.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace:\n\nThe post Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ). Only Apple makes smartwatches that utilize the iOS operating system.\n\nWill Alphabet do what Apple wasn't able to do, which is measurably improve the value of GOOGL stock by tapping into the relatively new category of consumer technology?\n\nMaybe, but if it does, it's going to take a massive paradigm shift that hasn't even come close to taking shape yet.\n\nNumbers Don't Lie\n\nMost owners of GOOGL stock may not even realize that Google actually beat Apple to the smartwatch market by launching one in 2014. Indeed, that's a key tenet of the problem. If people don't realize Alphabet makes such a device already, it's because the company has done a poor job of marketing itself.\n\nFortunately for Alphabet shareholders, this shouldn't be an impasse with the upcoming unveilings.\n\nUnfortunately, better marketing and more consumer familiarity with the idea of wearables isn't going to help much.\n\nSee, the smartwatch market is not a significant market for companies that drive tens of billions of dollars worth of revenue per year selling goods and services other than smartwatches. As of the most recent tally, only 39.5 million U.S. adults are expected to be smartwatch users by the end of the year . Initial estimates from a year ago said that figure would be 63.7 million.\n\nFor comparison, as of the end of last year, 68% of the nation's 242 million adults own smartphones . That's 164 million smartphone owners, most of whom just don't see the advantage of yet another piece of technology on their person.\n\nWe're seeing comparable metrics on a global basis.\n\nWhat's It Going to Take?\n\nTo answer the overarching question of marketability, look at the feedback consumers have served up about the Apple Watch and other smartwatches. Each device has some rabid fan because … well, there's always someone who finds something to love about anything. But some of the criticisms have been repeatedly voiced.\n\nOne criticism? It simply didn't do enough to improve or ease the user's life. Another reason owners stopped using them is rooted in the complicated (and small) interface.\n\nConsumers who have yet to buy one have suggested the same concerns as reasons for not purchasing a smartwatch … they just don't see much point.\n\nBoth balks underscore a key headwind for all smartwatches. That is, form matters just as much as function, and the necessarily tiny device's form doesn't deliver enough reasonable function. Even if the electronics could be further shrunk, wearer's fingers aren't going to shrink. Vision isn't going to improve (watch face/screens are small). And any advanced electronic device is still going to require lots of button-pushing per function, yet still won't be able to do it all as well as a smartphone counterpart does.\n\nThere's the rub for any hope that GOOGL stock will be catapulted by its new smartwatches - the device causes more problems than it solves .\n\nUntil and unless Alphabet/Google comes up with a device that's a decidedly better tool than a phone, a smartwatch won't be a game-changer for consumers or for their makers. And there's nothing about the upcoming Android watches that says any of the devices are going to cause such a paradigm shift.\n\nBottom Line for Google Stock\n\nTo be fair, even the first generation of Google's watch was impressive. Ditto for Apple. Expectations weren't terribly high, though, and now that most consumers have seen them, the reaction has mostly become \"meh.\"\n\nIt's not a reason to avoid owning GOOGL stock. Indeed, yours truly here has pegged Alphabet stock as one of the few must-have names to own in the coming year . But that bullishness had nothing do with success in the smartwatch arena. It was rooted in everything else Alphabet does well.\n\nAny shareholders looking for Alphabet to perform above and beyond current expectations on the back of new smartwatches are going to be disappointed.\n\nAs of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Does Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock NEED Smartwatches? appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "By all accounts, Apple (AAPL) had itself a very Merry Christmas.\n\nAccording to mobile analytics and advertising firm Flurry, owned by Yahoo (YHOO), Apple accounted for some 44% of smartphone and tablet activations during the holiday, dominating its competitors such as Samsung (SSNLF), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Though Apple did suffer a five-percentage point decline from last year's 49.1% share, Apple's 2016 Christmas performance more than doubled that of Samsung devices, which took second place with a 20% share.\n\nNotably, Samsung's 2016 holiday performance marks a slight year-over-year increase (19.8% in 2015) even as the South Korean tech giant suffered from exploding batteries, which forced it to recall millions of its Galaxy smartphones. And for the first time since Flurry began reporting its findings, Microsoft, which has struggled to make inroads in mobile, fell off the list. It was replaced by Huawei, which cracked the list for the first time and accounting for 3% of device activations.\n\nAll told, with Apple and Samsung taking 44% and 20%, respectively, everyone else, including LG, Amazon (AMZN), Xiaomi and Motorola, were left fighting over the 5% share of activations that were left. In the case of Apple, to the extent to which its device dominance translates to a happy new year for investors ... well, that remains to be seen. But if the strength of iPhone and iPad sales serves as indication, Apple, which is due to report first quarter results in mid-January, is poised to unwrap an earnings and revenue beat.\n\nWhere Apple prospered, Google fizzled, or pixelated -- to more accurate. The search giant, which earlier this year unveiled its new Pixel and Pixel XL phones, might as well not have done so. It seemed nobody cared. The devices were somewhat a nonevent during the holiday, according to Flurry. But depending on who you ask, Google's sales struggle could be because it didn't have enough supply to meet demand. We won't know for certain until management discusses Pixel sales specifics next month when the company reports fourth quarter results. But do they want to throw good money after bad?\n\nSpeaking of good money, the investments made to revive phablet sales have begun to pay huge dividends. Flurry noted that the number of phablets activated in the week leading up to Christmas grew 37%, marking jump of 10 percentage points from last year and an almost tripled the 13% recorded two years ago. The moral of the story? For Apple and Samsung or any other hardware vendor looking to secure market share, customers believe size still matters.", "\n\nImage source: Google.\n\nGoogle is the dominant online search engine nearly everywhere in the world except China. China just so happens to be the largest internet population in the world, but censorship laws in the country prevent the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company from operating how it would like to there. In its absence, Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) has built a commanding position, modeling itself off of the global leader in search.\n\nInvestors may look to Baidu for the significant growth opportunities that still lie ahead for it as China transitions from 3G mobile internet speeds to 4G and more consumers come online. But the steady growth of Google and its larger global presence may present a better buy right now.\n\nLet's take a look at how they compare.\n\nRevenue growth\n\nBaidu is a much smaller company than Alphabet with a market capitalization of $57 billion compared to $555 billion. And it was growing revenue relatively quickly as it rapidly brought on more advertising customers and its active user count increased.\n\nHowever, over the last year, revenue growth slowed to a crawl as it has gone back and validated all of its advertisers, weeding out some bad apples. Last quarter, Baidu's total revenue declined 0.7% year over year. If you exclude the impact of Qunar, the online travel search engine it sold its stake in earlier this year, revenue grew a modest 6.7% year over year last quarter. Over the trailing 12 months, Baidu's revenue grew just 3%.\n\nBaidu does expect revenue growth to return next year as it finishes validating its advertisers. Still, the company has experienced slowing revenue growth for several years now.\n\nBy comparison, Alphabet's revenue grew 14% over the last year. In fact, the company's revenue growth is accelerating. During the third quarter, Alphabet reported 23% revenue growth on a constant currency basis, up from 21% growth the year before. Most importantly, Alphabet's revenue growth has remained relatively steady over the last several years even as it's become one of the largest revenue generators in the world.\n\nEarnings growth\n\nGoogle's parent company is also better at turning its revenue into profits. Alphabet's profit margin through the first nine months of 2016 was 22%. Baidu posted a profit margin of just 14%.\n\nAgain, Baidu has the potential to improve margins if and when its current investments in its varied market opportunities pay off. Sales, marketing, general, and administrative expenses amounted to 32% of Baidu's revenue in the third quarter. Alphabet, by comparison, spent just 20% of revenue on SG&A expenses last quarter.\n\nAnalysts currently expect Baidu to grow earnings per share 33% next year. That's slightly better than expectations for Alphabet, which is anticipated to grow 19%. But where analysts expect Alphabet to continue growing at a fairly steady 19% clip over the next five years, they see Baidu's earnings declining an average of 2% per year over the next five years.\n\nValuation\n\nDespite the poor long-term outlook for Baidu, investors are still giving it a premium price. Shares currently trade for 29 times next year's earnings expectations. By comparison, Alphabet shares trade for just 19 times next year's earnings expectations.\n\nBaidu's sales are slightly discounted to Alphabet's with a price-to-sales ratio of 4.7, compared to 5.3 for Alphabet. But with Baidu's slowing sales growth, the discount ought to be much bigger.\n\nThe relatively cheap valuation of Alphabet combined with its steady revenue growth and higher profit margin make it a better buy right now than Baidu. Baidu has a lot of potential, but as it transitions out its advertiser validation, it needs to prove it can attract more legitimate advertisers to its platform and grow their average spend. Alphabet just needs to keep doing what it's doing.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Baidu\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here's a look at the Nielsen's top 10 apps of 2016, along with four observations.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nFacebook Facebook Messenger YouTube Google Maps Google Search Google Play Gmail Instagram Apple Music Amazon App\n\nFacebook is crushing it\n\nIn line with Facebook's recent impressive global growth in monthly active users, the world's largest social network's user base continued to grow handsomely in the company's home U.S. market. Facebook's average monthly active users (MAUs) in the U.S. during 2016 increased 14%, according to Nielsen.\n\nFacebook's Messenger also performed exceptionally, raking in 28% year-over-year growth and coming in second only to Facebook's own native app. Messenger's success follows a year of big investments in the messaging app, including live video, messaging bots, and business integrations. Messenger's 28% growth in U.S. MAUs doesn't necessarily come as a surprise, considering Facebook's global Messenger MAUs increased from 700 million in the third quarter of 2015 to over 1 billion by July.\n\nInstagram. Image source: Instagram.\n\nAnd Facebook's Instagram was a smash hit in 2016, too. Coming in at number eight on Nielsen's list, the photo- and video-sharing app saw its U.S. MAUs increase 36%.\n\nFurther, not only was Facebook's growth notable, but both Facebook and Messenger's 146 million MAUs and 130 million MAUs, respectively, were still well ahead of third-place YouTube's 114 million MAUs.\n\nAlphabet is succeeding on numerous fronts\n\nGoogle parent company Alphabet continues to shine in terms of the quantity of Google-branded apps making it into Nielsen's top 10, highlighting Alphabet's robust ecosystem of apps for simultaneously serving its customers and generating data for its advertisers. Alphabet's YouTube, Google Maps, Google Search, Google Play, and Gmail all made Nielsen's top-10 list.\n\nApple Music remains a key player in streaming music\n\nWhile streaming music company Spotify continues to outperform Apple Music when it comes to paying members across the globe, Apple Music is winning in the U.S. when it comes to unique monthly visitors to the streaming music app. In a nod to the continued success of Apple's streaming music service, Apple Music was number nine on Nielsen's list, clocking a notable 20% year-over-year uptick in monthly active users. Spotify didn't make the list.\n\nThis data reflects recent updates about Apple Music from the tech giant. The streaming service's paying subscribers recently surpassed 20 million, Apple said earlier this month. This is up considerably from 10 million in January.\n\nAmazon mobile app. Image source: Amazon.\n\nAmazon's soaring growth puts it in the top 10\n\nThanks to its monstrous 43% growth in monthly active users, Amazon's shopping app made a surprising entrance to Nielsen's top-10 list this year. The app's inclusion in Nielsen's top 10 apps shows how successfully the company has been riding the e-commerce wave in the wake of rising mobile adoption.\n\nAmazon's own data about global usage of its shopping app during the peak holiday season points to a similar trend. Shopping on the company's free mobile Amazon app increased by 56% during this important period, according to an update from the company this week.\n\nThese observations reinforce how Facebook, Alphabet, Apple, and Amazon consistently earn customer attention.\n\nFind out why Facebook is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\n\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

But depending on your risk tolerance and the patience you're willing to apply, making money doesn't have to be a challenging endeavor.\n\nThe tech sector, which has delivered 14% returns in 2016, should sustain the rally, thanks (in part) to the pro-business policies of President-elect Donald Trump. Not to mention, whether from a business perspective or personal, the tech sector's top-performers are flowing more and more into our everyday lives, affirming our reliance on their products and service. In that vein, these three 2016 winners -- not in any particular order -- should be stashed in your portfolio for 2017.\n\nFacebook (FB) - $118.01, up 12.76% in 2016 - 12-month target $160\n\nFake news might have dominated the last three months of Facebook's 2016 campaign, but there's nothing fake about the company's profits. The results of its fiscal third quarter, where it posted adjusted earnings of $1.09 per share on revenue of $7.01 billion, was the perfect example. Not only did both measures crush Wall Street estimates for 97 cents per share on $6.92 billion, it marked year-over-year growth of 91% and 56%, respectively.\n\nFacebook's dominant advertising prowess, thanks to almost 2 billion global users on its platform, is matched only by Alphabet's (GOOGL) strong search business. Plus, with the company now boasting more than 1 billion active mobile users, while Q3 average revenue per user rose to $4.01, Facebook's financial power will come into play in 2017. And with the stock down more than 8% in three months, my price 2017 target of $160 is good for 35.5% returns.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) - $771.40, up 14.06% in 2016 - 12-month target $950\n\nAs with Facebook, Amazon shares have lost some steam, falling 5.5% in three months. But the e-commerce behemoth, led by billionaire CEO Jeff Bezos, is coming off the all-important holiday quarter, where Amazon has already announced record shipments. From its interest in drone deliveries, its new grocery store concept, long-haul freight trucks, its fleet of airplanes, and a host of other endeavors, Amazon continues to strike fear in the hearts of any market leaders who believes their businesses can't be disrupted.\n\nAnd we haven't even mentioned the dominance of its cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services, which continued to rake in the big bucks. For the full year, ending December, Amazon is expected to earn $4.76 per share on revenue of $137 billion, marking year-over-year increases of 96% and 28%, respectively. I expect both figures to beat consensus and for Amazon to raise full-year 2017 guidance. Accordingly, AMZN stock, which I expect to reach $950 in 2017, should deliver 23% gains.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) - $63.28, up 14.13% in 2016 - 12-month target $76\n\nIn 2017 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will affirm his place as one of the best leaders in the tech industry. While he may never earn the level of respect or perceived a genius in the realm of CEO/founders Mark Zuckerberg or Bezos, Nadella has done something many thought was impossible: Detach Microsoft from the dying PC-dependent business it has been and turning it into a respected cloud juggernaut.\n\nJust as important, because of Nadella, the market has now forgotten how much it hated Microsoft under former CEO Steve Ballmer, who was blamed for missing the mobile trend, which cost Microsoft hundreds of billions of dollars. In 2017 Nadella's biggest job will be to integrate LinkedIn. Are you willing to bet against him? I'm not. MSFT stock will hit $76 in 2017, delivering 20% returns.", "How important is artificial intelligence (AI) to Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) ? During its most recent conference call, CEO Robin Li mentioned AI no fewer than a dozen times, and in a recent speech made this bold pronouncement:\n\nGone is the era of PC, and soon will we say goodbye to the era of mobile internet ... We believe that coming is the era of artificial intelligence.\n\nAndrew Ng, Baidu's chief scientist, has some experience in this area. During his previous tenure at Google parent Alphabet , he led the Google Brain AI project. He is also an adjunct professor at Stanford University, where he taught AI. In a recent interview , he stated:\n\nAI is very much baked into the DNA [of Baidu]. Recent advances of AI have accelerated our progress and the impact that AI can have.\n\nDeep learning is the area of AI behind all this excitement. With a paradigm shift of this magnitude, a rudimentary understanding of the science might help investors better understand its applications.\n\nImage source: Pixabay .\n\nSo, what is deep learning? In it's simplest form, it is a way to teach computers to learn. Using a software model and algorithms, scientists attempt to replicate the structure and function of the human brain, in an effort to recreate its capacity to learn. The result is an artificial neural network.\n\nTeaching the system takes massive computers and enormous amounts of data. It is fed a multitude of examples, discovers similarities across the examples, and interprets how they are related; it learns to distinguish or differentiate. This process involves hundreds or even thousands of examples and the correct answers for each. The system uses what it learns to solve future equations.\n\nBaidu is the search leader in a country with a base of 700 million internet users. This provides it with the requisite data, and a clear advantage. In a recent article , Mr. Ng had this to say:\n\nAmong leading AI teams, many can likely replicate others' software in, at most, 1-2 years. But it is exceedingly difficult to get access to someone else's data. Thus data, rather than software, is the defensible barrier for many businesses.\n\nBaidu began work on AI more than five years ago, and the Baidu Brain is the fruit of that labor. It focuses on four functional areas of deep learning: voice recognition and synthesis, image recognition, natural-language processing, and user profiling. With a multitude of potential applications, Baidu has been implementing these deep-learning capabilities across its ecosystem to drive success in many areas of its business.\n\nHere are three ways Baidu is harnessing deep learning to power its business:\n\n1. To improve user engagement\n\nBaidu is using AI to deliver a better user experience and improve customer satisfaction by making its apps more useful and efficient, beyond optimizing its flagship search.\n\nImage source: Pixabay .\n\nChinese writing uses thousands of characters, which makes internet searches on a smartphone extremely impractical. Most consumers in China prefer the ease of voice recognition for the task, and Baidu claims a 97% success rate in the field. Its Deep Speech 2 algorithm can, in some cases, recognize English and Mandarin better than people. Its Baidu Translate, based on deep learning, can translate 28 languages and processes, on average, over 100 million requests a day.\n\nBaidu is also using its AI-driven data to suggest customized restaurant and retail suggestions in its online-to-offline platform Nuomi. The data more accurately predicts traffic conditions for users of Baidu Maps, and provides more relevant content for the company's recently launched news feed.\n\n2. To improve efficiency\n\nBaidu's corporate headquarters is incorporating advances gleaned from AI. It uses a voice-recognition-based CRM (customer relationship management) system to field customer questions, and provides sales staff with real-time answers and data. It is also testing a facial-recognition-based entry-control system at Baidu Campus in Beijing.\n\nImage source: iamNigelMorris .\n\nAs Baidu Delivery service (formerly Baidu Takeout Delivery) expands from restaurants to other areas such as fresh-food delivery and on-demand logistics, AI provides better estimates for delivery times. During its most recent quarter, Baidu attributed 150% year-over-year growth in gross merchandise volume for its delivery devision to improvements based on this technology.\n\n3. To pursue new business lines\n\nImage source: Pixabay .\n\nBaidu recently entered the financial-services market. Here, it uses AI-based risk-control techniques including facial and fingerprint recognition, liveliness detection, and optical character recognition of identification documents.\n\nBaidu sees autonomous driving as an important area for future growth. It began testing driverless cars both in China and in California earlier this year. These cars use image recognition and deep-learning-based processing to navigate. Baidu has plans for small-scale mass production of autonomous vehicles by 2018.\n\nThe Foolish bottom line\n\nBaidu is leveraging its advantage in AI by implementing the knowledge gained throughout its portfolio of products and services. With applications in voice recognition, search, and much more, it is reaping the benefits of its considerable trove of data. It believes that AI has improved the majority of existing products, increased monetization, and provided better user experiences across the vast array of its consumer-facing products. While the value of these benefits would be difficult to quantify, the result may be priceless.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Baidu\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(NYSE: IBM ) with Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) or even Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) for that matter. However, those looking for income in 2017 should put aside all the negativity that has followed IBM stock in recent years and add it to your portfolio.\n\nSource: Open Grid Scheduler Via Flickr\n\nHere's why.\n\nThe key to any good dividend stock is consistently growing dividends. IBM has increased dividends for 21 consecutive years; in the last five years, International Business Machines has averaged annual dividend growth of 13.4%, a positive sign for anyone looking for yields of 3% or higher.\n\nIBM stock currently yields a healthy 3.3% despite its stock being up 21% year-to-date through Dec. 27.\n\nIt's especially positive given how much free cash flow the company has been allocating toward share repurchases in recent years. Since 2012, it has reduced its share count by 16.5% to 964 million shares. During those three years, it repurchased $32.2 billion of its stock and paid out another $13 billion in dividends representing 112.4% of its cumulative free cash flow.\n\nIt's no secret, then, why International Business Machines' revenues shrunk from $102.9 billion in 2012 to $81.7 billion in 2015 and non-GAAP operating earnings declined by 18% over the same period - a lack of investment in research and development and no meaningful acquisitions to speak of has literally been choking the life out of IBM.\n\nHowever, all that appears to have changed in 2015, providing dividend investors with a renewed interest in IBM stock.\n\nWhat's Going on With IBM Stock?\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, International Business Machines paid out $18 billion for share repurchases and dividends; in 2015, that dropped to $9.5 billion and so far, through the first three-quarters of 2016, it has shelled out just $6.5 billion, which means the company will have more available to pay down some of its $35.6 billion in long-term debt while still increasing the amount it invests in R&D.\n\nAt the height of its free cash flow in 2012, IBM was generating $18.2 billion, paying out 86% of it to shareholders. In 2016, if International Business Machines generates $15 billion in free cash flow and allocates no more than $9 billion to shareholders, it will have paid out just 60% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends and share repurchases, leaving a substantial amount to reinvest in its business.\n\nIBM has been on a journey over the last decade and it still has a lot of work left to regain a prominent place in technology. That said, it has made progress.\n\nIn 2005, its gross margin was 40%; today, it's 11 percentage points higher. A big driver of that is its software and services business, which includes the cloud. While its overall revenues are falling, International Business Machines' revenue from strategic imperatives established in 2014 such as big data, analytics, cloud, mobile, social and security are rising.\n\nIn 2015, revenue from its strategic imperatives increased by 26% excluding currency to $28.9 billion or 35% of its overall revenue. Its cloud revenue increased 57% in 2015 to $10.2 billion. In Q3 2016, its strategic imperatives generated $8 billion in revenue representing 40% of its total for the quarter.\n\nIts financial model for the long-term looks to generate low single-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit pre-tax income growth and high single-digit earnings-per-share growth through more share repurchases.\n\nBottom Line on IBM Stock\n\nBut before investors worry about share repurchases getting out of hand as they did in 2013 and 2014, IBM's long-term plan calls for annual dividend increases along with annual share reduction of 2% to 3%.\n\nSo, it will be buying back approximately 24 million in IBM stock for the foreseeable future, which works out to $4 billion in annual buybacks - a much more tolerable level.\n\nAlthough International Business Machines' transformation might not appear to be moving quickly enough, it has made progress in the past two years generating more of the kind of revenue it needs to in order to grow profitably.\n\nWith $10 billion in cash on the balance sheet and free cash flow turning higher, IBM stock is reasonably cheap at the moment despite being within 2% of its 52-week high.\n\nIf you're an income investor you ought to be begging for International Business Machines stock and its 3.3% yield because you won't get too many deals as good as this one.\n\nAs of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post International Business Machines Corp.

With anywhere between two and three decades to go until you call it quits on the working world, you should be looking for stocks that share two key traits: dominance and optionality in their fields, and the potential to pay a dividend in the future.\n\nMost financial experts would argue that paying a dividend now is more important, and that's certainly not a bad stance to take. However, I think the most relevant companies -- and the ones most rewarding to shareholders -- come 2041 have yet to start paying dividends. Owning a piece of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , or Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) can help ensure both capital gains and the potential for dividend payments...come retirement time.\n\nWhat the heck is optionality?\n\nDominance within a field is pretty easy to understand, but what in the world does optionality mean? Before I answer that, let's firmly establish that all three of these companies are dominant.\n\nAlphabet's Google owns 75% of the global desktop search market share, and an astounding 92% of mobile search globally, according to Net Market Share.\n\nFacebook's monthly active users has now eclipsed 1.75 billion people, or likely over 50% of all people with regular Internet access!\n\nIt may be hard to believe, but e-commerce accounts for just 8.4% of all U.S. sales. There's lots of room for growth, and Amazon is capturing the lion's share of it. According to Forrester Research, Amazon captured 60% of all e-commerce growth in 2015.\n\nBut let's get to that second part: optionality. In short, companies that embrace optionality realize the pace of change in the world is accelerating. The ability to know what will be relevant tomorrow has diminished, and only those that are light on their feet and able to adapt will survive.\n\nThe ideal mode for addressing this uncertainty is -- quite simply -- a trial and error approach. Companies that embrace learning via small failures will be the most relevant tomorrow. By accepting the pain of non-fatal errors, companies can expose themselves to ideas that can spawn entire new industries.\n\nConsider that Amazon started out only selling books. Then it moved to media. Then it added merchandise. Then it added an e-reader. From there it has moved on to groceries, tablets, and now -- the real cash cow -- cloud hosting. Along the way, founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has embraced trial and error, and it has proved enormously valuable for shareholders.\n\nLast year, Google changed its name to Alphabet to emphasize its stance on optionality (Alpha-bet). While the advertising dollars from Google still make up almost all of the company's sales, its moonshot projects -- including Nest, Calico, and driverless cars -- have the potential to create huge new businesses, while their failures will not render Alphabet dead in the water.\n\nFacebook hasn't taken quite as dramatic a stance on optionality but it still has lots of ways to remain relevant in the future. When the company went public, it had just its namesake platform. But that has expanded rapidly to four uber-popular services -- Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp -- and Oculus VR has the potential to join the list in the coming years.\n\nBut optionality isn't enough\n\nWhile I am confident all three have the type of optionality in their DNA that's necessary to remain relevant for decades to come, that alone isn't enough to recommend buying shares for a 40-something's nest egg. The second piece comes from dividend-paying potential.\n\nWhile none of these three currently offers a payout, it wouldn't surprise me at all if they started doing so between now and when you decide to retire. But by getting in now, the actual yield you'll be getting on your purchase price will be much higher than if you waited.\n\nFor example, let's assume you buy Facebook now at $120. It starts paying a $5 dividend ten years from now. Because the stock has appreciated so much (it's worth $500 in 2026), its yield is only 1%. But since you bought at $120, you're getting a 4.2% yield on your original purchase price.\n\nBy looking at the growing cash hoard of Alphabet and Facebook, it's not hard to see how a dividend could easily be in the offing.\n\nData source: SEC filings. Growing Cash Hoards At... Create column charts\n\nI'll be the first to admit that -- right now -- Amazon doesn't seem nearly as likely to offer a dividend. Facebook and Alphabet have seen phenomenal growth in their cash hoards, and neither sports any significant long-term debt. Amazon's growth has been far more tepid, and it has $8.2 billion in debt to boot.\n\nThat being said, this is simply part of Jeff Bezos' long-term strategy. By the time he's done building his moat around Amazon -- if that time ever comes -- he will have such operating leverage that I don't think it would take long at all to extinguish the company's debt and start raking in free cash flow at levels we haven't seen the company accomplish...yet.\n\nThat's why I think anyone in their 40s who is trying to build out a winning nest egg would be wise to include all three players in their portfolio. And lest you think these are empty words, my skin is in the game: these three combine to form 45% of my real-life holdings!\n\nFind out why Facebook is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\n\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

How and why did you get started in investing? What is your background?\n\nI started having exposure to investing in my first year of business school. Like many, I never pictured entering the investing environment. In fact, I did three years as a nursing student before making the switch to economics. From there, I started reading as much as I could, from every style of investing to studying the greats such as Buffett, Graham, Klarman, Cundill, Greenblatt, Pabrai, Lynch and many more. Oddly, my investment style started off with technical analysis, trading mainly options before progressing to deep value.\n\nHow I got into investing: In my high school years, I always wanted to contribute to society, so I pursued nursing. During my years as a nursing student, I would always ask myself if I was able to progressively excel, and if my passion would continue to grow in this career for the next 5, 10, 15 years, and until the end of my days. The honest answer was no, but it took me three years to accept that. In my current environment, business- particularly investing, I can confidently say I found my passion; I am where I belong.\n\nMoral of my story - be honest and act accordingly, it will save you some valuable time.\n\n2. Describe your investing strategy and portfolio organization. What valuation methods do you use? Where do you get your investing ideas from?\n\nIf I had to categorize my current and foreseeable investing strategy / style, it would be deep value. I like stocks that are mispriced and selling at a significant discount in relation to their intrinsic value; net-nets and cigar-butts. Essentially, I look for stocks where if I bought them today, and it were to liquidate tomorrow, paying all debts and returning all capital to shareholders, I would walk away with a significant profit. Generally (not a golden rule), I would do a valuation based on asset reproduction, earnings potential value then growth value, in that particular order. Valuation methods depend upon the nature of the business and the company, so it could vary significantly, but in the end- I require a margin of safety. I have a particular focus on current and liquid assets. I also prefer debt-free (or very little debt) and well-managed companies, but these are rare when it comes to deep-value stocks. I try not to get involved in industries I am unfamiliar with, such as biotech and complex firms. I much prefer simple businesses (particularly service, holdings and asset-based companies).\n\nIn terms of portfolio organization, deep-value stocks are usually small-caps and I try not to go over 10 stocks (deep value or not).\n\nI get my ideas from numerous places. It can range from a friend, articles posted online or certain investing sites, and sometimes certain screeners. Often, I like to look at SEC filings, Joel Greenblatt ( Trades , Portfolio )'s Magic Formula and the 52- week lows.\n\n3. What drew you to that specific strategy? If you only had three valuation metrics, what would they be?\n\nThe themes that drove me to this specific strategy are margin of safety and protection against permanent loss of capital. Those are my core concerns in any stock. Compound interest paired with good deep-value stocks, along with some time, will take care of the performance side. Of course, one should always be wary of value traps and miscalculations. Another reason that I like this strategy is that most of these stocks are under the radar- not popular nor researched as much in comparison to hot stocks, therefore I do not have to try to outsmart the next analyst or any of that sort.\n\nI do not put much emphasis on a single valuation metric, or even a few. Because valuations are subjective and financial models and forecasts are more of an opinion rather than a prediction or a prophecy, valuation is more of an art than an exact science. Therefore, every investment case has its own unique merit. In playing piano, you cannot play a masterpiece with a single note, you need the keys to flow together in order to project your art. Similarly, it is difficult to tell the story of a company with just a few valuation metrics, they all have to be included and analyzed together for a more \"logical\" valuation.\n\nBut, if gun to my head, and hesitantly, I had to choose only three valuation metrics, I would look for a good NCAV (Net Current Assets - Total Liabilities to be significantly positive), low price-earnings (as these stocks tend to perform well over the long run), EV/ EBITDA and, to add another one, price-book. In isolation, each metric has their own merit but also a significant blindspot.\n\n4. What books or other investors changed the way you think, inspired you or mentored you? What is the most important lesson learned from them? What investors do you follow today?\n\nI spend a lot of time reading, particularly business and investment books. Every single book has, in one extent or another, influenced me. I try to absorb the most useful concepts from these books and borrow ideas from various greats and mix them in a box with a little bias towards deep-value investing.\n\nYou can check out my full booklist here.\n\nMy very first investment book was \"The Neatest Little Guide to Stock Market Investing\" by Jason Kelly, which shed the very first investing light upon me. \"The Intelligent Investor\" by Benjamin Graham definetly made the biggest impression on me. \"Security Analysis\" by Graham and Dodd, \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\" by Burton G. Malkiel, \"The Most Important Thing Illuminated\" by Howard Marks (Trades, Portfolio) and \"Margin of Safety\" by Seth Klarman (Trades, Portfolio) have all helped reinforce the concept of margin of safety and protection against permanent loss of capital.\n\nOther great investors that have inspired me and that are worth researching are Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio), Peter Cundill, George Soros (Trades, Portfolio), Philip A. Fisher, Peter Lynch and Mohnish Pabrai (the list goes on).\n\nIf I had to single out an important lesson, it is that much of the investing knowledge can be learned for most individuals, the difficult part is controlling your emotions. As, Graham, the father of value investing himself, puts it:\n\n\"The fault dear investors is not in our stars- and not in our stocks- but in ourselves\".\n\nToday, I follow top value investors, particularly Buffett, Klarman and Greenblatt.\n\n5. How long will you hold a stock and why? How long does it take to know if you are right or wrong on a stock?\n\nI invest for the long run, but I would not put a specific time horizon on holdings (especially with deep-value stocks). I would say that deep-value stocks and undervalued stocks in general tend to eventually converge towards their \"intrinsic value\" after some time, so I hold them until then and re-evaluate, or until the margin of safety has been erased.\n\nAdditionally, if there is a threat for permanent capital loss, or if I was just wrong in my decision making, I will sell the stock. I change when the facts and fundamentals change. Typically, I would want to hold a stock forever, assuming it retains and can grow its intrinsic value in relationship to price. The dilemma some investors face is that often times, it may take a while for the market to correctly price an undervalued stock; this is why margin of safety is so important.\n\n6. How has your investing approach changed over the years?\n\nMy investment approach has evolved dramatically since I began my investing journey. I started more as a technical investor, holding active options. Early on, I had a strong reliance on technical metrics such as RSI, moving averages, volume and other technical indicators. Through personal growth, reading and acquiring greater knowledge, I transitioned to value and deep-value investing. Initially, I would use broader metrics and rely on quality companies with fair prices. Now, I lean towards deeply discounted stocks with relatively small downside and larger upside potential. I would say that my approach now is geared towards deep value, or an NCAV approach, which naturally drifts toward smaller caps- preferably service firms, some cyclical and asset-based companies (land, real estate). As a Canadian investor, these are quite difficult to find within the TSX, so I often have to look in the American exchanges. I have yet to fully explore other foreign markets. Every now and then, I tend to search for bigger, good-quality companies hoping to find a bargain, and I now hold a greater amount of cash.\n\nOf course, my investing strategy is continuously evolving- as is everyone's, and I have no bias against good-quality, well-established and moated companies selling at discounts, I just research more deep value.\n\n7. Name some of the things that you do or believe that other investors do not.\n\nThis is a great question! Things I do particularly would be that I usually think of the worst-case scenario during the analysis of a stock, and how I would objectively take actions post-purchase, additionally, what lessons I would learn if I were wrong. When purchasing a security, there are always two parties, a buyer and a seller. I always tell myself that everyone else is just as smart, if not smarter, than I am, so when I do make a decision- I am extra careful and remind myself that I can very well be wrong- which emphasizes my reliance on margin of safety. Furthermore, when I work on my valuation models, I try not to emphasize its importance because estimating certain aspects, such as rate of growth and earnings, with laser precision is nearly impossible (at least for me).\n\nUltimately, I feel that a big portion of investing is about yourself and your own honesty- of course, all this is purely my own opinion. I try not to be the next Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) (as much as it would be nice), but rather I strive to be the best version of myself.\n\n8. What are some of your favorite companies, brands or even CEOs? What do you think are some of the most well-run companies? How do you judge the quality of the management?\n\nMy favorite companies are what I define as quality companies; those that have a long-term horizon, are efficient, heavily moated, adaptable, increase shareholder value over time and, more importantly, honest. Some of these companies include Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B), Coca-Cola ( KO ), Wal-Mart ( WMT ), Google ( GOOG )( GOOGL ), Apple ( AAPL ) and the list goes on.\n\nTo no surprise, my favorite CEO is Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio). Others to be named are from the book \"The Outsiders,\" which are Bill Anders, John Malone, Tom Murphy and the list goes on.\n\nIt is hard to define \"well run,\" every company is different; some in different stages and industries. For instance, Delta Air Lines (DAL) has great operations- it is \"well run\" in relation to the nature of the industry- but the industry itself is very capital-intensive and hard to have a significant advantage over competition. Of course, quality companies are not always a good buy if they are overvalued- nor does it mean I will hold them. We must always think value in relation to price.\n\nTo me, quality management is based upon optimal decision-making and integrity. Judging the exact economic value added from a good management team is hard to gauge. Long-term past performance record in relation to economic events (booms, busts) should be an adequate indicator (I want to know how they performed in good and bad times). Other qualitative factors can be found in reading annual reports and filings. Overall, I do not emphasize management as much as the nature of the business operations- this is not to say management is unimportant.\n\n9. Do you use any stock screeners? What are some efficient methods to find undervalued businesses apart from screeners?\n\nI do use screeners, some from Morningstar and Bloomberg - no heavy emphasis. I think there are plenty of ways to find undervalued businesses by researching 52-week lows, researching cyclical sectors and reading investment ideas (other individuals have great ideas- but do your own research, too). By nature, small-caps and over-the-counter stocks will have the most undervalued businesses. Searching in smaller caps is a good start.\n\n10. Name some of the traits that a company must have for you to invest in, such as dividends. Talk about what the ideal company to invest in would look like, even if it does not exist.\n\nA company must absolutely be undervalued before I can consider it. Depending on the nature of the business, I would value it based on its asset valuations, then earnings power, then growth potential.\n\nThe ideal company would be one that is selling at a deep discount to its intrinsic value, say price-net net working capital of about 50%, it has a positive NI, does buybacks (historically), insiders and top-tier management historically have ownership and has a few upcoming catalysts. Additionally, it helps if the company has a simple business model that I can understand and relatively easier assets to value (land, buildings, holdings).\n\n11. What kind of checklist or homework do you utilize when investing? Do you have a specific approach, structure, process that you use? Or do you have any hard cut rules?\n\nI do not use a specific checklist, but companies that have the components mentioned earlier are considered. I do my very best to build models and valuations from scratch for anything that catches my interest. Structure wise, I always read the balance sheet first, then the income statement, then cash flow. These can easily be found through SEC filings. I usually read the most updated (recent quarter), then the previous fiscal years. No hard cut rules.\n\n12. Before making an investment, what kind of research do you do and where do you go for the information? Do you talk to management?\n\nAs previously mentioned, I seek out information from the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow from various sources like MorningStar and Bloomberg, but I mainly use SEC filings. After my own valuation, I usually make a decision on whether or not to invest in the company. I do not talk to management.\n\n13. How do you go about valuing a stock and how do you decide how you are going to value a specific stock? When is cheap not cheap? If you can, give some of examples.\n\nI mentioned valuation earlier. Cheap is not cheap if the company is burning through its cash and has no foreseeable measures to counter that. In this case, the margin of safety on a stock will quickly deteriorate. Another case is if it has no way to operate profitably in the future. Unforeseen liabilities and loss of sales (a big account) will render a company not cheap in the future (in relation to a current valuation).\n\n14. What kind of bargains are you finding in this market? Do you have any favorite sectors or avoid certain areas, and why?\n\nThere are always bargains available with enough research. I am looking mostly within the U.S. exchanges and the TSX, so my scope for deep-value stocks is more limited. Sector wise, I like service firms (they can expand and contract alongside the economy), smaller financials, real estate and some cyclicals. There are deep values in biotechnologies, but I tend to avoid them as I do not have a deep understanding of this sector. I avoid areas that make me scratch my head.\n\n15. How do you feel about the market today? Do you see it as overvalued? What concerns you the most?\n\nI have no particular feeling about the overall market. It is what it is. I have a high focus on U.S. stock markets and the Canadian market. I think their large-caps are priced accordingly, perhaps with a slight premium, and some stock valuations are absurd, but generally it is not overvalued nor cheap- purely my opinion. The interest rate hike might affect valuations and reverting back to the mean might take place, but that is not something I am overly concerned about. What will happen with the economy next? I do not know and neither does the next person. What will happen to the stock market this upcoming year? As J.P. Morgan puts it, \"It will fluctuate.\"\n\n16. What are some books that you are reading now? What is the most important lesson learned from your favorite one?\n\nI am currently reading \" HBR's 10 Must Read on Strategy\" by Harvard Business Review and \"Zero to One\" by Peter Thiel. I write about business lessons and concepts from books on my site.\n\nIf you have any recommendations, please do contact me. I love sharing ideas and learning new concepts.\n\n17. Any advice to a new value investor? What should they know and what habits should they develop before they start?\n\nI would say to keep an open mind, be creative and be yourself. Do not buy something you do not know. Every investing style has their own unique merit. Equally, if not more important, read and learn as much as you can. Practice, apply the knowledge by actually analyzing the company yourself, build your own models and valuations, strive for continuous growth and remember that nothing of value comes easy. We are human; we make mistakes. There is always someone better than you - so be honest and humble. Make time your friend, not your enemy.\n\n18. What are your some of your favorite value investing resources or tools? Are there any investors that you piggyback or coattail?\n\nResource wise, there are plenty of articles written over the internet; here on GuruFocus, Seeking Alpha, WSJ and countless others. I use Excel as my main valuation tool. I try to keep things simple, complex models do not necessarily yield a more accurate forecast or valuation. Borrowing ideas are fine, but you must absolutely do your own research.\n\n19. How do you manage the mental aspect of investing when it comes to the ups, downs, crashes, corrections and fluctuations?\n\nIt did take a bit for me to develop a better mental aspect in investing; when I started off with more volatile and risky investments, it would keep me up. But, learning and striving for growth paired with time has done its magic. Ups, downs, crashes, corrections and fluctuations are what make the stock markets. We can profit from them in many ways. Now, I am not particularly affected by how the market fluctuates. If I am right, time will tell; if I am wrong, again time will tell (but hopefully I recognize it early). I have no particular emotion towards the markets - it is what it is. I think being honest can help manage the mental aspect. For instance, if you feel like selling the stock because it took a drop, ask yourself what factual rationale is compelling you to make that decision- and if its fear (be honest), well you will know what you need to work on.\n\n20. How does one avoid blowups in value investing?\n\nExtensive due diligence and a sound rationale may diminish blowups. Minimizing leverage and avoiding it altogether would definetly help too. Prioritizing capital protection over seeking profits would be a logical solution. Concentration in poor companies can be a reason for blowing up (this is not to say you must absolutely diversify).\n\nStart a free 7-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .", "Google's new Home smart speaker. Image source: Google.\n\nChatbots won't just live in your favorite messaging app. Soon, you may be speaking with them through a smart speaker.\n\nIn December, Google launched a system for developers to build chatbots that work with Google Assistant -- the artificial intelligence (AI) that powers its Google Home smart speaker. Google's goal is to get people used to interacting with businesses through Google Assistant with simple-to-answer questions. Down the line, the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company is hoping users will start purchasing goods and booking reservations with the new chatbots.\n\nIf any of that sounds familiar, it's because it's the exact approach Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is taking with its chatbots for Messenger. When it comes to monetizing its messaging app, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has stressed the importance of developing organic interactions between users and businesses on the platform before trying to monetize.\n\nUltimately, Facebook and Google are working on similar solutions to solve the same problem of monetizing some of their fastest-growing sources of engagement.\n\nAn engaging problem\n\nGoogle and Facebook are seeing considerable increases in voice search and messaging, respectively. Google said voice searches have tripled over the past two years. Meanwhile, the number of Facebook Messenger users has climbed from just 200 million in April of 2014 to over 1 billion today. Facebook also says the average user spends 10 more minutes per day between Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger than it did in 2014, a 25% increase.\n\nBoth Google and Facebook are unable to take advantage of these growing sources of engagement the same way they've done with their other platforms. Display advertisements don't work nearly as well in a messaging app as compared to the Facebook News Feed. In the case of voice search, there may not even be a place to display ads at all. It'd be a bit off-putting if your Google Home suddenly lit up with a big \"click here\" banner (not that there's even a display).\n\nThe chatbot solution\n\nThe chatbot solution works for both platforms, as they're conversational in nature. Still, there are a couple of major hurdles for both Google and Facebook to overcome. First, they both need to attract a lot of developers. Facebook has already attracted 34,000 developers and has over 30,000 bots running on its platform. That's a strong start for a product that launched less than a year ago.\n\nMore importantly, however, is that users need to interact with chatbots. They need to be able to easily discover them, and there needs to be a compelling reason for them to use chatbots over another medium. Discovering chatbots on Messenger is relatively easy. Facebook is able to show popular bots when users search for someone to chat with. Finding new bots through the screenless Google Home is yet another challenge for Google to overcome.\n\nCutting out the middleman\n\nThere's not much Google or Facebook can do to get around their reliance on third parties to build bots for their platforms. Unfortunately for them, one competitor doesn't have to rely on third parties if it wants to sell goods and services. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) can sell things directly to consumers through its Echo smart speakers.\n\nAmazon also has a head start on both since it launched the first version of the Echo speaker in 2014. The company sold over 5 million units since the launch, according to a report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. And sales are growing fast. Amazon reported a ninefold increase in holiday sales of Alexa-powered devices this holiday season.\n\nAmazon isn't just selling physical goods, either. It's recently started moving into services like house cleaning and car repairs. While Amazon doesn't sell everything directly, it already has a popular platform for buying and booking just about anything you could imagine. As Amazon continues to build out the functionality of Alexa on its Echo speakers, there'll be no need to seek out specific bots (even though Amazon supports its own version of chatbots as well).\n\nThat existing base of commerce makes Amazon the biggest threat to Facebook and Google's monetization efforts for their growing platforms. With investors expecting both Facebook's messaging apps and Google's voice searches to start throwing off significant revenue in the future, Amazon may play spoiler for both.\n\nFind out why Facebook is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now\n\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Yes, AAPL stock registered double-digit gains and slightly outperformed the market (with one day of trading to go in 2016), but the year was hardly a stellar one.\n\nSource: Apple\n\nSales are down in key product lines like the iPhone. Its long-awaited MacBook Pro revision faced a barrage of criticism. The iPhone 7 was derided for looking too much like the iPhone 6 and for lacking a headphone port. And to cap it off, AAPL is closing out 2016 facing a series of issues with iPhone 6 batteries .\n\nAnd while Apple inc. has struggled, opponents have made hay.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has seized the premium PC mantle with its Surface Studio and Surface Book. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) made an end run around Siri and HomeKit to make the Alexa-powered Echo smart speaker a contender to control the smart home. Alphabet Inc . (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) entered the premium smartphone market with its Android flagship Google Pixel Phone.\n\nAAPL doesn't necessarily need to detonate everything and start all over from scratch, but it could use a turnaround or two in key categories.\n\nApple Did OK in 2016, But …\n\nAgain, short of something crazy happening Friday, Dec. 29, AAPL stock will have returned at least 10% for 2016. That's not bad. In fact, it's downright great compared to last year's 3% losses.\n\nThen again …\n\nIn 2014, AAPL returned 47%. In 2012, it was about 25%. Don't forget the heady days of 2009, when the iPhone was gaining in popularity and rumors were flying that the company was about to release a new tablet device (the iPad would be unveiled the following January) - and the market was rebounding out of the cellar. Apple stock gained 115% that year.\n\nAAPL is spending increasingly more on stock repurchases and dividends, so there's less of an expectation of rampant growth … but there's still some sort of expectation for outsize growth. Apple is, after all, a consumer tech company.\n\nAnd it's not just stock performance. Apple needs to return to form in many aspects, such as re-emerging as an innovator and a designer of world-class premium products.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, there are three key objectives that Apple needs to nail in 2017.\n\n#1: The iPhone 8 Needs to Be Hit\n\nThere are no two ways about it: The single most important product release in 2017 for AAPL is the iPhone 8.\n\nSales of iPhones are Apple's single largest source of revenue - 60% of Apple Inc. revenue in the last quarter . If the iPhone 8 is a big hit, it will reverse the slide in sales, and AAPL stock will be off to the races.\n\nTo get there, Apple needs to release a product that wows consumers. It must look nothing like the iPhone 6/6s and 7 - and the Android rivals that have adopted a similar form factor. It has to make them forget about headphone jacks and unreliable batteries.\n\nThe iPhone 8 needs to have the must-have appeal that makes iPhone owners clamor to upgrade, with line-ups outside Apple Stores once more.\n\nAt this point, rumors have AAPL going to an all-glass iPhone 8 with a curved display and wireless charging.\n\nIt's a start.\n\n#2: Apple Needs to Win Back the Mac Faithful\n\nThe Mac is no longer as important as it once was to Apple, but computers are still the company's third largest line of business. And in 2016, Mac fans felt not just ignored, but slighted.\n\nSome models like the Mac Pro and Mac Mini haven't been upgraded in years. And when Apple did release a new MacBook Pro, it seemed to have gone out of its way to anger many of its core customers by eliminating all legacy ports in favor of USB-C. The new TouchBar feature generally received a shrug from professional users, while higher cost and poor battery life continue to generate complaints.\n\nRubbing salt in the wound(s), in 2016, AAPL also discontinued the computer monitor and Airport wireless router lineups that have been popular with Mac owners for decades.\n\nIn 2017, Apple Inc. must do more than offer a discount on USB-C dongles. The company needs to update its Mac desktops - the Mac Pro, Mac Mini and iMac - with new processors. It can (and should) add USB-C ports to its computers, but it needs to leave a legacy port or two instead of arbitrarily eliminating them all and forcing customers to buy new peripherals or clumsy adapters.\n\nA 2017 MacBook Pro revision with a price cut, improved battery - and maybe even a retreat to adding one old-fashioned USB 3.0 port (although that move may be technically impossible at this point) would also go a long way.\n\n#3: Apple Needs to Refocus on the Home\n\nApple was a home tech pioneer with the 2007 Apple TV, but despite a wealth of tools at its disposal - including that Apple TV business combined with iTunes video streaming, HomeKit, Siri and its Beats Electronics audio gear - the company sputtered in the home in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, Apple Inc. needs to get on the 4K video streaming bandwagon with iTunes and the Apple TV or it's going to seem hopelessly out of sync with what consumers expect, especially when it charges a premium for its non-4K gear.\n\nAAPL also needs to get Siri into a Beats speaker before the Amazon Echo, and competitors from Google and Microsoft lock up the smart home.\n\nOf course a company like Apple has other balls in the air as well. In 2017, a thinner Apple Watch with improved battery life, a refinement of the iPad Pro line-up or new Apple Music features are possible. But these product lines all received big upgrades in 2016. Autonomous car plans are still underway and could pay off big, but not next year.\n\nBottom Line for AAPL Stock\n\nIf 2017 is to be a year where consumers are excited about the company and its products, and Apple stock has another one of those historical runs, the company needs to nail the iPhone 8, win back Mac fans and re-assert its presence in the connected home.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post 3 Things Apple Inc. (AAPL) MUST Do to Soar in 2017 appeared first on InvestorPlace .", "General Motors ' ( GM ) CEO Mary Barra said that the company would start testing autonomous cars on the roads of Michigan very soon to evaluate how the driverless technology would perform against the greater Detroit area's harsh winters.\n\nThis comes after Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder signed the bill permitting the testing of autonomous vehicles on Michigan roads.\n\nGeneral Motors plans to test the self-driving Chevy Bolt electric vehicles on the public roadways of Michigan after Snyder agreed to allow the testing of certain parameters for testing and deploying driverless cars in the state. Michigan aims to move ahead of California and other states in a drive to become home to the autonomous car movement. Silicon Valley players including Tesla ( TSLA ), Alphabet ( GOOG )( GOOGL ) and Uber are at the forefront of implementing self-driving technology. The laws provide ride-sharing services to use autonomous cars without human intervention.\n\nBarra made another major announcement that the next generation self-driving cars would be produced in the Orion Township assembly plant, where the company manufactures the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt. The testing vehicles will be equipped with LIDAR, sensors, cameras and other devices for safety. Barra said in a press conference, \"We expect GM will become the first high-volume auto manufacturer to build fully autonomous vehicles in a mass production assembly plant.\"\n\nThe Detroit automaker has already been testing its driverless vehicle in its Technical Center campus in Warren, Michigan. In total, General Motors has around 40 testing vehicles in the two cities. The automaker now plans to extend its testing to the public roads in the metro area of Detroit. General Motors proposes to make the area its key location for advancing its autonomous technology for winters.\n\nThe bill signed by Snyder lays out parameters for testing the technology by establishing regulations on how driverless vehicles could legally run on public roads. The enacted law permits testing of vehicles without human intervention and without steering wheels or pedals.\n\nHowever, there are certain challenges that driverless cars would have to face. During winters, snowfall can cause the roads to be unclear and such tough road conditions would make the movement of cars not driven by humans unpredictable.\n\nPush toward going autonomous\n\nGeneral Motors' moves in the last 18 months have clearly displayed its aggression in developing the autonomous technology. The carmaker's announcement regarding its partnership with startup firm Lyft and acquisition of Cruise Automation are among its latest initiatives in advancing its autonomous technology.\n\nThe automaker has been fueling its effort to develop a strong robust autonomous technology. This can be validated through the company's latest partnership and acquisition moves. In addition, General Motors has also been testing prototypes in Arizona and California. At the press conference, Barra displayed the electric Chevrolet Bolt with rooftop sensors, which is designed to assist autonomous driving.\n\nGeneral Motors has been working hard to build a foolproof driverless technology. The company's management hasn't disclosed when General Motors will begin testing without a human driver but expects it to happen over the next two years. General Motors also plans to begin operating a fleet of self-driving taxis, which would be allowed under the Michigan law.\n\nDisclosure: I do not hold any position in the stock mentioned in this article.\n\nStart a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .", "Sina ( SINA ) has reported strong growth in ad revenues this year due to the increasing popularity of its websites and apps such as the Sina mobile app and social media platform Weibo. The company generates a significant portion of its revenues from online brand advertising and marketing on its websites and social media platforms. In addition to advertising revenues, the company makes money from mobile value added services (MVAS) and other fee-based services for data licensing, corporate accounts and other gaming related services.\n\nOver the years Sina's advertising business has thrived , with revenues growing at a CAGR of over 20% in the last five years. The trend has continued in 2016 thus far, with ad revenues through the first three quarters of the year (particularly on Weibo) driving much of the top line growth. Below we take a look at how Sina has performed this year.\n\nWeibo Drives Ad Revenues\n\nSina's advertising revenues were up by 16% y-o-y to $602 million through the first three quarters of the year, as shown below. Comparatively, non-advertising revenues - which include MVAS revenues, Weibo value-added services and other services revenues - increased by around 11% to $116 million. A key point to note here is that within the advertising segment, Weibo has been instrumental in driving growth for the company while portal advertising revenues on Sina's platforms have struggled this year. Weibo-ad revenues were up by 40% y-o-y to $383 million while portal advertising revenues (generated from online brand advertising on Sina.com and Sina mobile properties) from January through September this year fell by around 10% year-over-year to $219 million.\n\nWeibo's social media platform had many similarities to Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), Facebook ( FB ), Instagram and video-sharing capabilities similar to YouTube to engage more users on its platform. Weibo has over 600 million registered users with almost 400 million monthly active users (MAUs) by the end of Q3 this year. As a result, Weibo has become a popular advertising space among digital brand advertisers in China. Ad revenues from Weibo's advertising segment have been boosted by a robust contribution from small and medium enterprise (SME) customers. Sina launched self-service ads in late 2014 to further help SME accounts post more relevant ads. As a result, ad revenues from SME customers have contributed significantly to growth in ad revenues . This is likely to continue to drive ad revenue growth in the long run.\n\nFurthermore, advertising segment has a higher gross margin than the company-wide gross margin. Sina's advertising segment gross margin stood at just under 65% this year, which was almost 4 percentage points higher than the year-ago period. Comparatively, the non-advertising segments have gross margins of less than 60%.\n\nMargins, Profits Surge This Year\n\n\n\nDriven by strong growth in ad revenues and advertising segment gross margins, Sina's company-wide gross margin improved by 350 basis points to 64.2% through the first three quarters of the year. In addition to strong growth from major revenue streams, Sina was successful in restricting growth in the net operating expenses as shown below. Sina's non-GAAP operating expenses through the three quarters of the year were roughly flat over the comparable prior year period at $359 million, which led operating income (non-GAAP) to grow almost five-fold to $97 million. Resulting year-to-date net income and earnings per share were also significantly higher than the prior year period. as shown below.\n\nWe expect future revenue growth and improvement in gross margins for Sina's advertising segment to continue in the coming years, driven primarily by Weibo's growing customer base and user engagement. In addition to revenue growth, Weibo's strong presence in China's social media market should help improve the company monetize its user base more effectively.\n\nWe have a $54 price estimate for Sina's stock , which is around 10% lower than the current market price. Sina's stock price has fluctuated between $41 and $84 this year.

Recently, Baidu teamed up with KFC to open a new \"Smart Restaurant\" in Beijing which uses facial recognition technology to make order recommendations. Image recognition hardware installed at the restaurant can scan the consumer's face and make recommendations based on the customer's profile (age, gender) or previous order history. This new feature will be launched at just one restaurant as the company experiments with AI in this business. However, this is an indication that AI is likely to be a key growth driver for Baidu in the next few years. The company is experimenting with this technology in several business lines, including autonomous cars among others. We believe Baidu's growth in the long term can be driven by innovative use of this technology.\n\nIncreased Focus On Artificial Intelligence In New Lines Of Business\n\nBaidu's experiment with KFC is an indication that the company is ready to innovate with its expertise in the artificial intelligence space. According to Baidu, its voice and image recognition technology are fairly mature and the company is working on developing natural language processing and user profiling. With a strong focus on this technology Baidu is looking at innovative ways to monetize this capability. While its \"Search Services\" segment is the company's key revenue driver, AI can not only support growth in this business but also create new revenue streams. In addition to increasing user engagement and efficiency in its existing search business, leveraging AI for new lines of business can drive growth for Baidu in the long term. While the \"Smart Restaurants\" idea holds some potential, it is more noteworthy as an indication of how AI can be used in a variety of consumer-facing businesses.\n\nView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):\n\nGlobal Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap\n\nMore Trefis Research", "InvestorPlace InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNokia Corp (ADR) (NYSE: NOK ) stock has gained a little over 10% in the last two months after experiencing a bit of a rally. However, looking at the picture for the entire year, Nokia stock is still off 31% year-to-date. The fact is that despite the recent comeback, NOK stock still faces several tough fundamental challenges.\n\nSource: Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine via Flickr (Modified)\n\nConsider that NOK's outlook for next year calls for a 2% decline in the networking business. It's important to note that telecom carriers have been holding off on purchases because they have already spent substantial amounts on upgrading their networks to 4G technologies.\n\nThere is also weakness in emerging markets. In fact, with the surge of the dollar, the problems may get even worse. All of this is kind of grim, right? But when it comes to investing, a contrarian approach can certainly lead to nice profits.\n\nSo does Nokia stock fit the bill? Perhaps the company is poised for a turnaround? Well, let's take a look.\n\nThree Pros to Owning Nokia Stock\n\nInnovation : Nokia Technologies is the segment that focuses on consumer and professional technology offerings, such as those for digital health and media. Although, for the most part, much of the growth has been from licensing its extensive patent portfolio.\n\nBut NOK is certainly investing aggressively with its own innovations. For example, the company has developed a sophisticated virtual reality system for professionals. One of the marquee clients is Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE: SNE ), which has had lots of success with its PlayStation VR platform.\n\nIn addition to this, Nokia is making another play for the smartphone market. The device is called the Nokia P , which is based on Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Android operating system and will be manufactured by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd. (OTCMKTS: HNHPF ). Granted, the smartphone market is brutally competitive. But it is encouraging that NOK is taking some risks. Besides, the company has a lot of experience marketing technologies in developing countries.\n\nNokia stock has also been getting more adventuresome with mergers and acquisitions. Just look at the deal for Withings. The company is a pioneer in the connected health market, such as with digital weighting scales, activity trackers and baby monitors. According to NOK's own research, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 37% from 2015 to 2020 .\n\nNetwork : NOK has a high-performance, end-to-end platform, covering mobile networks, fixed networks, IP/optical networks, applications and analytics. Because of this, the company has been able to sell to a wide assortment of customers, such as in verticals like energy, the public sector and transportation. What's more, the recent acquisition of Gainspeed has been important in attracting cable operator customers too.\n\nBut the real play is for 5G mobile networks. According to a report from Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC ), the market is expected to hit 550 million users by 2022. A key driver will be the megatrend of the Internet of Things, which involves wireless connections among devices, as well as video and VR.\n\nAccording to InvestorPlace.com's Dana Blankenhorn : \"If you get into Nokia now, you're catching the next wave of network spending at its bottom, and can ride that wave to profit. That is the bull case, and while that might take some time to prove out, it's a good bet carriers will spend again in the next three to five years.\"\n\nDividend and Fiscal Disciplne : With the transformative acquisition of Alcaltel Lucent, NOK is expected to generate savings of €1.2 billion per year. And these may ultimately prove to be fairly conservative. If anything, NOK has shown a great ability to be disciplined with its cost structure.\n\nIn other words, margins are likely to expand over time, especially as the network business starts to recover.\n\nIn the meantime, investors will likely enjoy a competitive dividend, which is at nearly 6%.\n\nThree Cons to Owning Nokia Stock\n\nHistory and Brand : NOK has a storied history. Back in the late 1980s, the company realized the potential of the mobile industry and started to develop its own devices. Nokia was also critical in establishing the core standards for wireless systems. So by the end of the 1990s, the company was one of the most valuable tech operators in the world.\n\nBut unfortunately, NOK failed to keep up the innovation, which allowed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and GOOGL to dominate the market. By 2012, Nokia stock sunk below $2 a share and it looked like survival was in doubt.\n\nSo yes, it is remarkable that the company has been able to get some stability and invest in growth. But then again, when it comes to turnarounds in the tech industry, the success rate is usually not so good. It is incredibly tough to catch up - and there is always the tarnishing of the brand. After all, how many people want to buy a product from a company that seems like a has-been?\n\nCompetition : Even with the consolidation, the networking business remains highly competitive. Granted, some of the rivals are not particularly strong, such as Ericsson. But these kinds of companies can still be very problematic since they are often tempted to engage in price wars.\n\nAlthough, for NOK stock the biggest threat could be from the operators in China, like Huawei and ZTE. They not only have the benefit of low-cost platforms but also preferential access to their home markets.\n\nMoreover, growth has been strong. For the first half of this year, the revenues of Huawei spiked by 40% to $36.8 billion . Then again, the company has a diversified revenue base, which not only includes the sales of networking equipment but also smartphones (ranked No. 3 in the world).\n\nCurrently, NOK has the second highest market share for wireless infrastructure equipment, at about 26%. This compares to Huawei's 23%. However, given the company's growth ramp, it probably won't be long until it becomes the world leader.\n\nPatents : Licensing of intellectual property has been the only growth driver for Nokia stock. In the latest quarter , this business helped ignite a 109% increase in sales for the Nokia Technologies division. The run-rate for the year is expected to hit €950 million.\n\nBut there is a big issue: About €150 million of existing licensing revenues will expire this year. This is one of the reasons NOK has been ramping up its legal efforts .\n\nYet this type of litigation can be time consuming and unpredictable. And even if there is a win, it can still take years of appeals to get any resolution. More importantly, AAPL is known to be a tough fighter when it comes to IP claims.\n\nBottom Line On Nokia Stock\n\nWhile the long-term prospects of 5G look promising, it will take time for the market to get going. Customers will certainly try to find ways to delay the heavy investments and try to find ways to keep leveraging the existing networks. There are also the intense competitive forces that will weigh on margins.\n\nIn the meantime, NOK stock must deal with other problems, such as the expiration of a bulk of the licensing business. If the company is unable to manage this, the revenue impact will definitely be significant.\n\nSo given all this, the cons outweigh the pros - even though Nokia stock does sport a compelling dividend yield.\n\nTom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog IPO Playbook and is a registered investment adviser representative (you can visit his site to learn more about his financial planning services).

(NASDAQ: AMZN ) makes its money and, chances are, they'll say it's an online retailer. There's no denying that the company is a behemoth in the e-commerce space and all but invented the category back in the go-go days of the dot-com boom. It's also a fact that Amazon still gets the bulk of its revenue from online sales.\n\nSource: Atomic Taco Via Flickr\n\nBut, there's more driving AMZN stock than just online sales.\n\nJeff Bezos and Company have created an interesting web services business on the side. Through its own data collection efforts, Amazon has continued to expand on that premise and is now one of the rising stars in cloud computing and data analytics. It's in these projects that AMZN could see the biggest growth down the road.\n\nFor investors, the continued growth in its web services and data center division might be the most promising driver of AMZN stock over the long term. It's pretty clear that Amazon is much more than just another retailer.\n\nIt's All About Data at AMZN\n\nBelieve it or not, Amazon and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) have a lot in common. Yes, one is a search/advertising company and the other is a retailer. But, they share a love of data. A lot of it. Terabytes worth of information.\n\nEvery time you perform a search on Google or send an email via Gmail, Google is quietly searching through all your information, using complex algorithms to tease out whatever information it can. Advertisers love this info and it's what has made GOOGL a powerhouse.\n\nGuess what? AMZN is doing it too.\n\nEvery time you search, buy, or buy again, Amazon is collecting millions of pieces of information. The company stores and processes that information on its vast server computers. For years, AMZN quietly did all of this collection and analyzation behind the scenes. But, one day, Bezos and his cohorts had a thought: \"If we're collecting and searching through all this data, I bet someone else is, too.\" And, just like that, the Amazon's Web Services (AWS) division was born.\n\nInitially, AWS was simply an outsourced server farm. You could contact Amazon to host your business processes on one of its data center sites and access it via the cloud. Thousands of smaller businesses flocked to this easy-to-access \"public cloud\" as the costs to implement it vs. the cost of building out an entire IT infrastructure are next to nil. Revenue for AWS has grown more than 55% year over year.\n\nAMZN Stock Hooks the Big Boys\n\nBut, just offering a space for storage isn't the end of Amazon's cloud computing endeavors. AMZN has continued to build an entire ecosystem of tools and software designed to massage its customers own data analytics, as well as provide access to some of its generated data. Since 2014 (when the business launched) Amazon has added over 500 features and software tools.\n\nIts latest pushes are designed to attract Fortune 500 companies to its cloud services.\n\nThese include a host of new artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning products, as well as a new managed services offering. This allows customers to offload the boring, mundane tasks such as updating software, patching systems and similar IT chores. Believe or not, using a data center doesn't get you access to these sorts of tasks. Companies still need to do it themselves.\n\nThis is a huge differentiating point for AMZN vs. cloud rivals such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ). More importantly, these services have been designed with Amazon's overall mantra in mind: save customers money. Businesses can fire their entire IT staff and save bundles by switching to AMZN's services.\n\nHeck, Amazon will even drive over a 100-petabyte mobile hard drive to help corporate clients upload their data to AMZN's cloud.\n\nAll of these efforts seem to be working to attract corporate clients. Amazon's case studies include Kellogg Company (NYSE: K ) using AMZN's data analytics to improve commodity trading, and drug maker Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) improving its R&D to more efficiently answer consumer questions.\n\nThe Big Win for AMZN Stock\n\nIt's clear that retail operations still run the show at AMZN, but the new AWS division is what's really driving growth. As it is able to plug more big corporate clients into its system, the potential at Amazon is huge.\n\nRight now, AWS accounts for less than 10% of Amazon's revenue. Shopping still rules the roost. But, margins at AWS are crazily high as, once it's in place, Amazon doesn't have to do much. As a result, last quarter, the company's cloud services division contributed roughly 75% of overall profit.\n\nIf Amazon is able boost revenue from the sector - and it should because SaaS applications and web-hosting is a fee based business, not a one-time sale - profits from AWS should continue to soar. In the end, cloud computing could be the real driver for AMZN stock, and retail sales might eventually become the side business.\n\nFor investors looking at AMZN stock today, its future continues to be tied to cloud computing. Don't think of Amazon as merely a play on e-commerce.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIt's no secret that Amazon is a monster retailer. But, what will really drive AMZN stock over the long term is its cloud computing division. Margins and profits here are what dot-com dreams are made of. At the end of the day, Amazon's future will be all about the cloud.\n\nAs of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post Buy Amazon.com, Inc.

Then there was the mega acquisition of SolarCity, as well as the announcement of nearly 400,000 advance deposits for the Model 3.\n\nNow, fresh off of the holiday season, traders are bidding Tesla stock up on a deal with Panasonic Corporation (ADR) (OTCMKTS: PCRFY ) to drop more than 30 billion yen (about $256 million USD) on a Tesla production facility to make photovoltaic cells and modules.\n\nToday's 3%-plus move exemplifies the broader theme - TSLA stock is erratic. In 2016, Tesla had a range of $144 to $265 - with the year-to-date loss coming to 8%. That's disappointing considering the markets have ended the year on a very bullish note. It's important to keep in mind, however, that Tesla stock has had a long run of strong gains. During the past five years, compound annual growth hit a staggering 50%.\n\nSo what kind of opportunity are we looking at with Tesla stock? Well, to see, let's consider three pros and cons on Tesla stock.\n\nTSLA Stock Pros\n\nInnovation: Tesla Motors has made major breakthroughs in battery technologies (allowing for drives of over 300 miles on a single charge), electric powertrains and software systems. Yet the company has also been innovative with its business model, such as having online purchases of vehicles as well company-owned showrooms and service centers. The result is that Tesla has direct connections with its customers and better control on quality service.\n\nInterestingly enough, a Tesla car is kind of like an app. That is, there are periodic updates to the systems with \"over-the-air\" transmissions. This has definitely been key with the Autopilot technology, which allows for semi-autonomous driver assistance. So is it any wonder that Forbes currently ranks Tesla as the world's most innovative company ? Not really.\n\nMegatrend: The auto industry is in the midst of major technology changes. Companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ), Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) have made big investments and acquisitions in the category. Of course, the main focus is on autonomous driving. According to research from Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY ), the market could hit $15 billion within the next few years.\n\nAll this is certainly good news for holders of TSLA stock. The company has been investing in new-fangled auto technologies since 2003. What's more, the Autopilot hardware has logged over 1.3 billion miles so far. In other words, Tesla has a major advantage in terms of data and analytics. But the growth is likely to ramp for some time. For the second half of 2016, TSLA expects to ship 50,000 cars , which is roughly the same amount for all of last year.\n\nThe Elon Factor: At 45, Musk is already a legend of the tech industry. Besides Tesla, he has launched other breakout companies, such as Zip2, Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL ), SolarCity and SpaceX. Along the way, Musk has made billions for shareholders. Unlike many in Silicon Valley, though, he is not only technically super smart but has incredible marketing chops. Oh, and he is not afraid of \"going big.\" Let's face it, how many people have the goal of eventually living on Mars? Such qualities have inspired Musk's workforce, which has led to amazing achievements.\n\nTSLA Stock Cons\n\nSolarCity Deal: On Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ), Musk sent out the following regarding the acquisition: \"Tesla + SolarCity future: solar roofs + batteries + electric cars.\" Definitely ambitious, right? Of course. But there has still been quite a bit of skepticism on the Street.\n\nOne of the issues is that SolarCity has been a big-time money loser. For the past year, the company has reported nearly $2 billion in negative operating cash flows . Keep in mind that there are heavy capital costs and marketing expenditures. The competitive environment is also intense and there are concerns that the regulatory environment could get tougher. Let's face it, the Donald Trump Administration may not be too interested in maintaining tax credits for solar energy projects.\n\nIn light of all this, analysts at Morgan Stanley provided the following grim assessment : \"Given (SolarCity's) financial condition and recent reduction in guidance, we have assumed zero value for (SolarCity) equity to (Tesla) shareholders.\"\n\nValuation: Even with the recent drop, TSLA stock is still far from cheap. The multiple is at about six times sales. No doubt, this is at quite a premium to traditional auto manufacturers. Consider that General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) sport multiples at about 0.3 or so.\n\nIt's true that the premium valuation for TSLA is due to the strong growth ramp. And there is lots of value for the intellectual property. But then again, profitability has remained elusive. If anything, TSLA will likely continue to voraciously raise capital to meet production targets, build the massive Gigafactory and fund SolarCity. In other words, there will likely be ongoing dilution for shareholders.\n\nPerhaps this is why short sellers have been targeting TSLA stock. Right now, the short interest is at a hefty 40% of the float, which certainly indicates that many investors are expecting a fall in the value of the shares.\n\nProduction Issues: Demand has not really been a problem for Tesla. Instead, the real challenge has been to produce enough vehicles. After all, the company has a limited number of facilities - and technical complexities are mind-boggling. It seems inevitable that there will be snags. Yet the biggest problem may be to achieve profitability on a unit basis. According to a recent 152-slide presentation from hedge fund manager Mark Spiegel , the Tesla Model 3 could cost $48,000 to produce. However, the company has plans to sell it at $35,000!\n\nAll in all, this seems like a pretty good deal for customers - but not for holders of TSLA stock. Granted, TSLA may ultimately decide to hike the price. But this could mean a drop in sales. No doubt, this essentially highlights the extreme difficulties of succeeding in the mass market.\n\nBottom Line on TSLA Stock\n\nMusk has always had many doubters - and he has had a knack for proving them wrong. And so far, he has done a tremendous job with TSLA. It's actually downright amazing that he was somehow able to stave off bankruptcy during the financial crisis.\n\nBut going forward, TSLA will deal with its biggest challenges - such as selling into the mass market and also managing a solar energy company. Just doing one would be incredibly tough. In other words, there is really not much margin for error.\n\nOK then, should you buy Tesla stock? No, not for now - the risks just seem to high, especially in light of the valuation.\n\nTom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog IPO Playbook and is a registered investment adviser representative (you can visit his site to learn more about his financial planning services).

Not unlike, say, when powerhouse FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) lit up the market in 2015. But with year-to-date gains of almost 14%, compared to 9% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index, there's little for tech investors to complain about.\n\nHere's the thing, however: Unlike 2015, FANG stocks this year didn't do the heavy lifting and more of the wealth was shared among other tech names. The FANGs lost tons of bite and were pretty pedestrian in 2016. Take a look at the chart a few graphs below.\n\nAfter gaining 141% last year, Netflix shares have risen just 10% in 2016, marking the biggest drop among the FANGs on a percentage basis. This was followed by Amazon, which has gained about 12.5% year to date, falling from 120% returns last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook and Alphabet, which have posted respective 2016 gains of 12% and 4%, struggled to duplicate their 2015 respective returns of 37% and 49%.\n\nIn all four cases, expecting these companies to repeat their 2015 success would have been unrealistic. But with three out of the four names besting the or -- at least -- tracking the S&P 500 Index's 10% rise, the group didn't stink up the joint. And while Alphabet's 4% rise would seem as a disappointment, take it as a buying opportunity. I expect next year's recap will yield better results.\n\nAll told, the FANGs were displaced by the likes AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA), which posted respective gains of 303% and 235%. Add in Qualcomm's (QCOM) 38% rise and you've got a nice chip party. All that's missing is the dip and soft drinks. Speaking of soft, Microsoft (MSFT), which rose 17% in 2016, seems rejuvenated under CEO Satya Nadella's cloud-first strategy. While 17% is nothing to brag about compared to AMD, Microsoft stock will end 2016 at near tech-bubble highs.\n\nLikewise, IBM (IBM), which has soared some 26% this year, will end the year as one of tech's biggest surprises. Raise your had if you saw Big Blue posting such green. Notably, despite suffering iPhone revenue and shipment declines, the fact that Apple (AAPL) has gained 13% in 2016 underscores the level of optimism investors have about 2017. It remains to be seen whether Apple can deliver. But with some $230 billion in cash on the balance sheet, a 2.00% dividend yield and new products on the way, taking a bite out of Apple never seems like a bad idea.\n\nBy contrast, despite Twitter's (TWTR) 28% decline, it will be tough for the company to turn things around in 2017. Same with GoPro (GPRO), which lost some 50% of its value in 2016. But if either company gets acquired in 2017, all bets are off.\n\nTwo stocks to keep an eye on are Intel (INTC) and Cisco (CSCO). Both pay respective dividend yields of 2.8% and 3.4% and are making strong headway in the Internet-of-Things, which is expected to be a huge market in 2017.", "\n\nImage source: Netflix\n\nNetflix 's(NASDAQ: NFLX) content library isn't just some mashed together pieces of disparate content the streaming video leader could get its hands on for cheap. Netflix has crafted several computer algorithms to determine what shows to produce, what shows and films to license, what content to show to each user, and apparently how much to pay for each piece of content.\n\nIn a recent Business Insider article detailing how documentarian Craig Atkinson ended up not selling his film to Netflix, he revealed an interesting detail about Netflix's negotiation tactics. Specifically, he said a Netflix lawyer told him an algorithm determined the price of his film, \"and that basically was the end of the discussion.\"\n\nAI is an integral part of Netflix's business. It says its content recommendation engine saves it $1 billion per year . Who knows how much it saves by using AI to determine how much it should be paying for content?\n\nNetflix uses its biggest competitive advantage to stick to a budget\n\nThere's a bit more pressure on Netflix to stick to a content budget compared to other players in the digital video space. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , for example, can fall back on its retail and cloud businesses to subsidize its content budget. Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google can support big cash outlays from YouTube. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) has also gotten into content acquisition recently, and has a big advertising business to support it.\n\nNetflix, on the other hand, only generates revenue from its streaming service. In fact, it's using debt to support its content spending as it expands overseas. Amazon Instant Video, YouTube, Facebook, and HBO can all draw from the piles of cash at their respective companies.\n\nAs such, Netflix needs to be exacting when it comes to how it spends its content budget, eking out any efficiencies it can. And it's using its biggest competitive advantage to do so.\n\nNetflix has an unrivaled amount of viewer data. It has nearly 90 million viewers -- nearly 50 million in the U.S. -- spending an average of around two hours streaming movies and TV shows every day. And it's careful about whom it shares that data with .\n\nDeveloping an AI algorithm to make content purchasing decisions based on its user data is one of the keys to Netflix spending its budget wisely.\n\nNetflix's competition is growing, and they have deep pockets\n\nNetflix completed its global expansion earlier this year, but the competition isn't far behind.\n\nAmazon just launched its Instant Video service globally, and represents one of the biggest threats to Netflix. Analysts expect Amazon to spend between $4 billion and $5 billion on content next year after doubling its spend in the second half of 2016. Netflix expects to spend $6 billion next year. But Amazon is also charging less than Netflix at just $5.99 or 5.99 euros per month compared to Netflix's standard $9.99 per month. It's able to undercut Netflix because it doesn't need to make a direct profit from streaming video.\n\nYouTube and Facebook are also competing for consumers' attention. Both already have large global presences and engaged user bases.\n\nYouTube has reportedly explored licensing TV shows and films for its premium YouTube Red subscription service. It's also reportedly planning to launch a digital pay-TV service with livestreaming networks early next year.\n\nFacebook, too, is getting more serious about video content. It's reportedly in talks to produce its own original shows to support its new dedicated video section in the flagship Facebook app.\n\nThe common threads between all of these video platforms is that they're not under significant pressure to generate a profit as a stand-alone service and their parents have piles of cash. Nobody is really digging into their financials like the Street does with Netflix every quarter. If management really wants a piece of content, they can probably get it.\n\nOn the other hand, Netflix needs to be more restrained with how it spends. With some of the best AI and one of the largest sets of viewer data to feed it with, it's well positioned to spend its budget more efficiently than its competitors.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Netflix\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And it made it pretty clear they have something cooking there. The NHTSA can grant exemptions to certain compliance standards if that organization decides that it's important for research and investigations. Apple's letter was essentially urging the administration to expedite the exemption requests that are coming in from some new entrants, so, some people that maybe haven't been quite as ambitious as the early entrants into autonomous driving. That, I think, says all you need to hear about their interest in this space, and the fact that it's something that they're obviously putting a decent number of resources into.\n\nDaniel Sparks: Yeah, I think that Apple is definitely working on a car, as far as we can tell. Recent reports suggest that the company has hundreds of employees working on it. The transition, initially, it was referred to as Project Titan, and it initially transitioned away from building a car -- this is all speculation, keep in mind -- to really focusing on the technology, similar to Alphabet . The rumor is, now, it's going to be deeply integrated into iOS, and the company is looking for a 2017 deadline of proof of concept of something that can work. So, Alphabet and Apple, these are still really speculative things. But, at least with Alphabet, we're starting to see a direction, an actual company, and an effort to monetize the business, which is encouraging.\n\nLewis: And for both of those companies, these are things that are exciting. They're very attractive, they're fun to speculate on because they are nascent tech. But they are not going to be meaningful to the top line or bottom line for quite some time. That's something to keep in mind there.\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

We're a self-driving car company, not a car company.\" I think, if you look back at some of the things that have happened in the last month or so, you see that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) seems to be taking kind of a similar route with their autonomous driving ambitions.\n\nDaniel Sparks: Right. We see these big tech companies, and then you look at the giant automobile segments, where companies like Alphabet and Apple don't have any significant revenue, and in theory, it looks like this awesome opportunity for Alphabet and Apple to start making these cars. Maybe that's why a lot of the speculation received so much attention, thinking about a Google-branded or Apple-branded car is a really powerful idea. It could open up the companies to huge new revenue opportunities. But, when you actually get down to think about it, especially in Alphabet's case, it would really be out of their core competency to start making cars. Even Apple, by outsourcing their manufacturing and building Apple-branded hardware products, along with their software, cars is just a whole 'nother breed. It's a really capital-intensive business. By Alphabet doing this -- and now, like we're going to talk about, Apple focusing on the software part of the business -- it really de-risks these new segments. But on the other hand, may decrease some of the potential upside if things do go well.\n\nLewis: Yeah, you look at the margin profile for the car business and the smartphone business, and they are dramatically different. It would be very tough to achieve high-30% margins in cars. For as much as I know about the industrials business, I know that. So, you can understand why these huge tech companies are instead choosing to focus on something that's super scalable and can be easily brought into millions of cars without actually having to manufacture them themselves.\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Sure, Apple Watch is easily the most successful smartwatch to date, but that doesn't actually say a whole lot since it's one of the first wearable devices in the nascent category. There isn't much competition to begin with.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) technically beat Apple by a few months, with Android Wear devices becoming available in late 2014. Since then, Apple has taken over and Android Wear has hit a wall. The search giant just re-acqui-hired some smartwatch engineers in preparation of its big 2017 push, as Android Wear 2.0 was recently delayed until next year amid lack of hardware partners. Meanwhile, just days after Google unveiled the Pixel, the first smartphone that it fully designed, rumors surfaced that the search giant was working on its own flagship smartwatches.\n\nIt turns out those rumors were at least partially true.\n\nA tale of two flagship smartwatches\n\nIn an exclusive interview yesterday with The Verge , Android Wear product manager Jeff Chang confirmed that the company has two flagship smartwatches in the pipeline for the first quarter. The wearable pair will be the first devices to run Android Wear 2.0. Despite the smartwatch market's recent hesitation, Google still wants to show consumers that smartwatches are viable products that can add value to people's lives. Simply put, Google wants to save the smartwatch market.\n\nHowever, Google isn't designing the smartwatches entirely by itself, nor is it manufacturing them. Instead, Google is taking the same approach that it did with the Nexus phones of yore, where it collaborates with a third-party original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to develop the devices, which will primarily carry that OEM's brand. Chang declined to specify which OEM it is partnering with, beyond noting that it is a current Android Wear partner. That's a sprawling list, but more than likely it'll be one of the familiar Android OEMs like Huawei, Samsung , LG , or Motorola, among a few other candidates. Notably, HTC has not released an Android Wear device ( yet ), so although it is manufacturing the Pixel, we can safely rule out the Taiwanese company.\n\n2017: The year of the smartwatch?\n\nThe key to unlocking the smartwatch market's potential will be to empower devices for general purposes. Thus far, manufacturers have focused heavily on fitness functionalities, given wearables' natural applications for tracking activity metrics. Whether or not Android Wear 2.0 can deliver this remains to be seen, although it has potential. The major headliners of the update will be stand-alone apps, additional user customizations, and requisites like messaging and notifications.\n\nWhile Google can't singlehandedly save the smartwatch market, the subsequent and persistent competition will inevitably improve all products within the category, and that may do the trick.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Earlier this year, a consortium of investors led by Baidu CEO Robin Li wanted to buy out the iQiyi business for $2.3 billion, but later dropped the bid after investors claimed that the price was too low. Various market research firms and hedge funds estimate iQiyi's valuation at anywhere between $2.5 billion and $5.5 billion. According to our estimates, the online video division makes up around 5% of our $178 price estimate for Baidu's stock . Our price estimate is roughly 8-10% higher than the current market price, valuing the company at around $62 billion and the iQiyi business at around $3.1 billion.\n\nSee our complete analysis for Baidu\n\nKey Metrics For iQiyi\n\nBaidu started its online video business back in 2012 in an attempt to capture the shifting customer demand from television to online video streaming. Baidu's online video business includes its iQiyi video platform, which has an extensive video content library that includes licensed movies, television series, cartoons, variety shows and other programs. In addition to sourcing licensed content, iQiyi also produces a wide array of original content and provides online community services to facilitate user communication and interaction - similar to what Netflix ( NFLX ) does in the U.S. and internationally. We forecast the company's online video services revenues to increase at around 60% annually in 2016 to $1.3 billion - which would be about 11% of Baidu's net revenues - making it the fastest growing revenue stream for Baidu.\n\nAlthough it is the fastest-growing revenue stream within the company, Baidu has operated its streaming video business at a loss over the past few years. The trend is likely to continue over the next few years until the segment matures. The operating costs for Baidu's online video segment consist primarily of content acquisition costs, bandwidth costs, and other SG&A and marketing expenses. Content costs for iQiyi increased almost tenfold from $140 million in 2013 to to $1.3 billion in 2015. Similarly, both marketing expenses and bandwidth costs increased by over 80% in 2015. In the long run, however, we expect the business to generate positive margins for two primary reasons. Firstly, most of iQiyi's bandwidth costs are fixed in nature, which means that these costs may not recur with revenue gains. Secondly, high content acquisition costs are unlikely to increase at the rate of revenue growth, owing to economies of scale. We currently forecast Baidu's online video segment to report an operating profit starting in 2018.\n\nAccording to an estimate by iResearch, the online video market in China has grown at a CAGR of over 70% since 2013 to become a RMB 14 billion ($1.8 billion) market by the end of 2015. One of the key factors driving the online video market in China include internet penetration, which has increased from 35% of the population in 2010 to over 50% last year, as well as an increasing mix of high-definition content on the internet. Another primary driver of current and expected growth is the mobile video business, which is being driven by increasing smartphone penetration in China. Factoring in these reasons, iResearch estimates that the online video market in China will grow at 55% this year and at a CAGR of just under 35% from 2016 through 2018 to become a RMB 110 billion market by 2018. In this market space, iQiyi primarily competes with Alibaba's ( BABA ) Youku Tudou, and Tencent's video business, with all three roughly valued at $5-7 billion each.\n\nBaidu's online video revenues grew at over 30% from 2013 through 2015, with its share in the market increasing from under 10% in 2013 to 13.3% in 2015. We forecast Baidu's share in the market to go up to 15% by the end of 2018. Correspondingly, the company's video revenues could continue to grow at around 25% annually over the next few years.\n\nBaidu has not only made large expenditures to acquire premium copyrighted movies and television shows, it has also produced original content exclusive to its platforms and affiliated third party platforms. Earlier this year,Baidu announced that it will invest roughly $1.4 billion to purchase and produce content in the coming year. ((Baidu Plans $1B IPO for Video-Streaming Site, Fox Business, December 2016)) Given the massive amount of investment required to compete with its rivals, it might make sense for the company to spin off the video business in the short term. According to our estimates, the iQiyi business is worth $3.1 billion to Baidu. If the company can raise $1 billion for iQiyi at a valuation of almost $5 billion, it could be a favorable decision for the company. You can modify the interactive charts in the article above to gauge how a change in the online video market and Baidu's market share can have on our price estimate for Baidu.\n\nView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):\n\nGlobal Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap\n\nMore Trefis Research", "Honda (NYSE: HMC) said on Wednesday that it is \"entering into formal discussions\" with Waymo, the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) company formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project, about a tie-up that could put Waymo's technology into some Honda vehicles.\n\nWhat Honda said about its discussions with Waymo\n\nThe two companies are discussing a collaboration similar to the one that Waymo entered into with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU) earlier this year (when it was still a Google project.)\n\nUnder that deal , Waymo and FCA engineers and technical experts worked together to integrate the Waymo technology into FCA's Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans. One hundred of the Waymo-ized Pacificas will join Waymo's on-road test fleet early next year .\n\n100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrids will soon join Waymo's test fleet. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.\n\nHonda said that its collaboration could \"initially\" provide Waymo with Honda vehicles modified along similar lines. But Honda's statement hints that the collaboration could go beyond that. After noting that Honda is already developing its own self-driving technology, it said the tie-up \"could allow Honda R&D to explore a different technological approach to bring fully self-driving technology to market.\"\n\nWhy announce discussions when there's no deal yet?\n\nIt's a little odd for companies to put out a press release announcing that they're beginning discussions about a collaboration. But Honda did, and the announcement clearly had Waymo's blessing. Why?\n\nI think both companies get some benefit from letting the world know that they're in serious talks about a collaboration.\n\nFor Honda, the announcement lets investors and other potential technology partners know that the company is serious about incorporating self-driving technology into its products sooner rather than later. Honda has its own self-driving research project underway, but a collaboration with Waymo could give it a big boost -- albeit at a cost.\n\nAn Acura sedan with a prototype version of the self-driving system that Honda has been developing in-house. Image source: Honda Motor Co., Ltd.\n\n\n\nAll of the established automakers are under considerable pressure to show that they can keep up with potentially disruptive technology companies entering the automotive space. Honda hasn't had much to show recently; this announcement could put it back in the forefront of some tech-minded investors' minds.\n\nIt's also possible that the timing of this announcement is related to Honda's product plans. Honda is expected to reveal an all-new version of its Odyssey minivan at the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit in January. Given Waymo's established interest in minivans and apparent intent to start a ride-hailing service, it's very possible that any collaboration will be centered on the new Odyssey.\n\nSo why did Waymo play along? Waymo just last week became a separate company under the Alphabet corporate umbrella, and reports have said that it plans to launch a ride-hailing service using semi-autonomous Chrysler minivans late next year. That would be a big step forward for its relationship with FCA, and suggests a deeper tie-up between the two companies, maybe even an exclusive one. (Waymo CEO John Krafcik has made it clear that the company has no intention of building cars on its own.)\n\nI think Waymo might want the world to know that it's not bound to an exclusive relationship with FCA -- or put another way, it's letting other automakers beyond Honda know that it's open for business.\n\nWhat's next for Honda and Waymo?\n\nThat will presumably depend on how these \"formal discussions\" pan out. A statement like this is a strong hint that both companies are inclined to do a deal, but that perhaps the specifics and limitations of the deal are still being debated.\n\nWe'll have to wait and see, but it seems more likely than not that Honda will soon be working with Waymo in some capacity. We might learn more next month at NAIAS, where the new Odyssey will be revealed -- and where Waymo's Krafcik is scheduled to make an appearance.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Honda\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
