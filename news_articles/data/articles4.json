A new report has found that Russia's criminal underworld is trading hundreds of millions of stolen usernames and passwords belonging to these accounts\n\nWHICH ACCOUNTS ARE AT RISK? Russia's Mail.ru email service accounts for the majority of hacked accounts. Researchers discovered 57 million account details being traded in Russia. A large number also belong to Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo Mail users. Yahoo Mail credentials totaled 40 million, or 15 per cent of the haul. Hotmail accounted for 33 million, which equaled 12 per cent of the leak And 24 million, or nine per cent, belonged to Gmail account holders. There is currently no way to know if your details are on the list of threatened accounts. Mail.ru is now checking whether any combinations of usernames/passwords match users' e-mails and are still active. It will warn users if they are at risk. Yahoo and Google did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHolden, who last year uncovered the largest data breach to date, claims that the details of 272.3 million stolen accounts are now being traded.\n\nThey include the majority of users of Mail.ru, Russia's most popularemail service, and smaller fractions of Google, Yahoo and Microsoft email users.\n\nIt is one of the biggest stashes of stolen credentials to beuncovered since cyber attacks hit major US banks and retailerstwo years ago.\n\nThe latest discovery came after Hold Security researchersfound a young Russian hacker bragging in an online forum.\n\nThe hackers said hehad collected and was ready to give away a far larger number ofstolen credentials that ended up totalling 1.17 billion records.\n\nBecause he or she vacuumed up data from many sources, researchers have dubbed him 'The Collector'.\n\nAfter eliminating duplicates, Holden said, the cachecontained nearly 57 million Mail.ru accounts - a big chunk ofthe 64 million monthly active email users Mail.ru said it had atthe end of last year.\n\nIt also included tens of millions ofcredentials for the world's three big email providers, Gmail,Microsoft and Yahoo, plus thousands of accounts atGerman and Chinese email providers.\n\n'This information is potent,' said Holden, the former chief security officer at U.S. brokerage R.W.

Birthdays and years of birth are easy to guess with the help of personal information. Common names such as Michael and Jennifer are insecure, with many making SplashData’s Top 50 list, too. Experts suggest using eight mixed types of characters, with seemingly random combinations if possible. They say that passphrases – short words with spaces or other characters separating them – are easy to recall and are relatively secure if seemingly random words are used. Experts also advise having different passwords for different sites, instead of relying on one, which if hacked, could prove particularly serious.\n\nHowever, he gave up the dataset after Holdresearchers agreed to post favourable comments about him inhacker forums, Holden said.\n\nHe said his company's policy is torefuse to pay for stolen data.\n\nSuch large-scale data breaches can be used to engineerfurther break-ins or phishing attacks by reaching the universeof contacts tied to each compromised account.\n\nThis multiplies therisks of financial theft or reputational damage across the web.\n\nHackers know users cling to favourite passwords, resistingadmonitions to change credentials regularly and make them morecomplex.\n\nIt's why attackers reuse old passwords found on oneaccount to try to break into other accounts of the same user.\n\nAfter being informed of the potential breach of emailcredentials, Mail.ru spokeswoman Madina Tayupova told Reuters:'We are now checking, whether any combinations ofusernames/passwords match users' e-mails and are still active.\n\n'As soon as we have enough information we will warn theusers who might have been affected,' she said.\n\nTayupova addedthatMail.ru's initial checks found no live combinations of usernamesand passwords which match existing emails.\n\nA Microsoft spokesman said stolen online credentials was anunfortunate reality.\n\n'Microsoft has security measures in placeto detect account compromise and requires additional informationto verify the account owner and help them regain sole access.'\n\nResearchers discovered 57 million account details being traded in Russia.

Up to 14 articles from publishers that have been properly “AMPified” (Google’s term, not mine) now appear at the top of Google News on all mobile platforms, in a format similar to the carousel of stories that started showing up in search results at the end of February\n\nThe Google News headlines carousel will contain only AMP articles, but news stories below it are currently a mix of AMP articles — marked with a lightning bolt — and non-AMP (“regular” pages), ranked by Google’s usual “many, many, many different signals,” Maricia Scott, engineering director of Google News, told me. The carousel is available for U.S. English outlets at the moment, but will be coming to other countries and domains in the next few months. Users can swipe through the carousel to move from one AMP story to the next.\n\nThe potential appeal of AMP to publishers is twofold: first, faster load times for their mobile pages, and second, preferential treatment from Google for AMPed pages. Google already gives faster pages a slight bump in its ranking algorithms, but making this sort of carousel AMP-only is another strong push.\n\n(The Google News carousel actually already showed up for me on my iPhone on Tuesday, though it formally launched Wednesday afternoon; Google told me it had been testing the feature with some users.)\n\n“This is good for both users and publishers: Users can read more articles, and publishers benefit because they see that users will engage more with their stories, once they know it will load quickly on mobile,” Scott said. “We don’t have specific numbers yet on how people have been engaging with AMP pages, but we can say preliminarily that that users are engaging with AMP content more than they are with regular content.”\n\n“Users aren’t spending the time waiting for regular pages to load — as they see the AMP stories and engage with them, they’ll start learning quickly that AMP content loads faster,” she added.\n\nAccording to Google, AMP pages load an average of four times faster than non-AMP pages. Our own little speed test here bears that out.\n\nWhat about stories from paywalled sites? Richard Gingras, Google’s head of news and social products, told the Lab after the official rollout of AMP that monetization — support for paywalls and advertising — was a work in progress.\n\n“Enabling publishers to have their business models around subscriptions and sign-ins is critical to the AMP framework, and we have a client-side model for this that’s been adopted by places like The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and the Financial Times,” Rudy Galfi, product lead for AMP, said. “We’re collecting some insights now on how that’s working, and we’re really excited about including server-side options for paywall functionality to better satisfy publisher needs.”\n\nGalfi added that there was still more work to be done in this area, but “we’re thrilled to be collaborating with publishers, as we don’t have any expertise in this area.”\n\nAds and improving support for analytics, too, continue to be a work in progress. “Ads is an intense area of focus for us,” Galfi said. “We’re looking at how we can continue to get publishers more options and flexibility. We continue to have door open for any ad tech vendor or provider to come in and integrate code with the AMP project. To date, two or three dozen have come in and contributed code. And then beyond that, we’re continuing to have discussions about richer ad formats that could work in AMP.”\n\nRecently, for instance, The Atlantic (native advertising is projected to make up 75 percent of the publisher’s ad revenue this year), partnered with an ad tech company to create AMP-specific ad units that are fast-loading but still include analytics information publishers want.\n\nCompanies like comScore, Parse.ly, and Chartbeat and Google’s own analytics are AMP-supported, and Galfi said he understood newsrooms’ various needs when it comes to audience measurement. “Within analytics, you can have many different kinds of triggers. Say, I want to collect some data when a user clicks a button, when a user scrolls, on how deep a user got. Our framework provides all sorts of triggers, and will continue to work with publishers here as well,” Galfi said. “This is interesting from an advertising and analytics point of view, on the question of viewability: Does a user see more than 50 percent of an object on a page? One of the things we’re working on adding to the analytics framework in AMP is a viewability-based trigger: Tell me how far the user scrolled such that they saw at least a certain percent of the item.”\n\nOn the user-facing, formats side, Google is working on better liveblog support, which it says publishers have also been asking about: “We’re interested in exploring, how can we dynamically bring in content, where content will auto-refresh on the page and new content will be pulled in? We’ve been working on a feature that will enable publishers to do that sort of thing, and hopefully we’ll see more liveblogging.”\n\nAnother feature Google is now experimenting with based on publisher feedback is support for a sidebar menu that would allow users on the page to see related stories from publishers’ sites (“the code’s all there and it’s usable, but it’s not on by default, and publishers can test things out as they want to,” Galfi said).\n\n“We’ve been talking with publishers about the types of reader experiences they want on their pages, and one of the things they wanted was for readers to be able to have onward journeys on their sites, links to related content, and we have a really nice way to put this in AMP through a mechanism that lets publishers dynamically query stories to populate on the page,” he said. “In a similar vein, through continued discussions with publishers, we know another reader experience they wanted was a sidebar menu: if you’re in the entertainment section and you want to give visibility to your sports or business sections that readers can tap to access.”", "When Google shut down its Chinese search engine in 2010, it gave up access to an enormous market. There are more than twice as many people on the Internet in China as there are residents in the U.S., and the number of Chinese Internet users is growing at a rate that far surpasses that of any other country. Google has plans to return to China in the near future, but why did it turn away from the country for so long? Censorship is why. Google effectively shut down its Chinese operations after it discovered a cyberattack from within the country that targeted it and dozens of other companies. And while investigating the attack, Google found that the Gmail accounts of a number of Chinese human-rights activists had been hacked. Google had set up shop in China four years before the breach, offering a version of its services that conformed to the government’s oppressive censorship policies. At the time, Google officials said they’d decided that the most ethical option was to offer some services—albeit restricted by China’s censors—to the enormous Chinese market, rather than leave millions of Internet users with limited access to information.\n\nBut the 2010 attacks prompted the company to reverse course. Instead of complying with government requests to filter its search results, Google directed all of its Chinese traffic to the uncensored Hong Kong version of its search engine, a move that left the company vulnerable to being completely shut down in China. Indeed, Google’s services became inaccessible to most Chinese users within months. Google’s move to pull the plug in China is an extreme example of the kinds of decisions Internet companies operating abroad are often up against: If they want to do business, they have to abide by local laws, which can include restrictions on speech. And since the United States has some of the most permissive freedom-of-speech laws in the world, American companies must adapt in order to do business even in parts of the world that are culturally very similar to the U.S. Western European countries, which receive top marks from Freedom House for online openness, are far less tolerant than the U.S. of hateful speech and images. In Germany, where distributing swastikas is considered hate speech and is illegal, regulators recently investigated a complaint that Facebook was not adequately enforcing national hate-speech law. But it’s inconceivable that Facebook would close down its service in Germany just because the government asks for more censorship than the First Amendment would permit. In countries with more repressive governments, companies routinely receive requests to take down a much wider range of content that violates local laws. In Russia, for example, speaking ill of public officials can lead to costly libel suits; just across the Black Sea, “insulting Turkishness” is punishable by fines and jail time. There are a few things that companies can do to push back against censorship-happy governments without losing access to an entire country. Lee Rowland, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, says companies should generally submit to governments’ requests for censorship, if it means they can keep delivering their services. But when they take down content from their platform, Rowland says, the company must be transparent.\n\n“If these companies do whatever they’re capable of doing to publicize that their content is being screened, monitored, and sometimes censored by governments, I think there’s a really good argument that maintaining a social-media presence is inherently a liberalizing force,” Rowland said. To that end, Google, Facebook, and Twitter all publish a detailed annual transparency report, where they show the number and type of content-takedown or user-information requests they received, and the number they complied with, from each country where they operate. The companies also lay out their rationale for dealing with these requests: Facebook, for example, says it checks every incoming request for “legal sufficiency” and “reject[s] or require[s] greater specificity on requests that are overly broad or vague.” But even the most thorough transparency report can be difficult to access in the countries where the reported censorship is taking place. Rebecca MacKinnon, a prominent Internet-privacy advocate at New America, says companies should start thinking about how they will deal with free-speech issues even before they start doing business in a repressive state. “It’s about anticipating in advance what positions you’re going to be put in, and deciding in advance whether that’s an acceptable position to be in,” MacKinnon said. Many companies undergo a “human-rights impact assessment” before they expand to a new market with potential censorship pitfalls.\n\nThe calculus that goes into making decisions about free speech abroad is complicated. But there are few things that companies can do to push back against censorship-happy governments without losing access to an entire country. Companies can set up stringent review processes for legal takedown requests. A stringent review can make sure governments aren’t taking advantage of Internet companies to censor content outside the bounds of the law, and thorough reporting and transparent policies can spur local activism to change repressive laws. Twitter is an interesting test case. As with any company, its tolerance for complying with government requests can be gleaned from its actions. Twitter’s transparency report shows a sharp rise in takedown requests in 2015, driven in large part by a high volume of requests from Turkey and Russia; the company continues to operate in both of those countries. In Iran, however, where Twitter has been blocked for more than five years, Twitter has made changes to accommodate Iranian users that are able to circumvent their government’s Internet filters. The company recently began allowing users with Iranian phone numbers to activate two-factor authentication, a login option which can protect accounts from being hacked. Rowland called Twitter’s actions in Iran the “ethical high-water mark for resisting government attempts to censor access to content.” (A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the company’s legal and business decision-making, and spokespeople for Google and Facebook were not available to comment on this story.)\n\nWhen deciding how to deal with censorship abroad, companies aren’t going at it alone. The Global Network Initiative, a privacy and digital human-rights organization, provides a roadmap for companies navigating business in repressive legal environments. GNI members represent for-profit companies—including Google and Facebook—investors, and nonprofit and academic organizations. MacKinnon, who was a founding member of GNI and sits on its board, says the organization provides a space for companies who are up against tough choices to confer with other members, academics, and privacy advocates, in order to make informed decisions. But she says most companies are too preoccupied chasing short-term profits to put too much time and energy into implementing long-term free-speech protections. “GNI has at least put a framework in place that’s preventing things from being much worse than they’d otherwise be,” MacKinnon said. Companies that do business abroad—even just in Europe—are dealing with an increasing number of government requests for content takedowns every year. Europe’s two-year old “right to be forgotten,” a European Union decision that allows citizens to ask Google to remove links to misleading, inaccurate, or irrelevant information about them, has opened a whole new category of content takedown requests. And growing worry that terrorist groups like the Islamic State are using social platforms to recruit and spread propaganda means that more governments are on the lookout for content that promotes terrorism, which typically violates platforms’ terms of service.", "Three years ago, Silicon Valley developed a fleeting infatuation with a startup called Zee.Aero. The company had set up shop right next to Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., which was curious, because Google tightly controls most of the land in the area. Then a reporter spotted patent filings showing Zee.Aero was working on a small, all-electric plane that could take off and land vertically—a flying car.\n\nIn the handful of news articles that ensued, all the startup would say was that it wasn’t affiliated with Google or any other technology company. Then it stopped answering media inquiries altogether. Employees say they were even given wallet-size cards with instructions on how to deflect questions from reporters. After that, the only information that trickled out came from amateur pilots, who occasionally posted pictures of a strange-looking plane taking off from a nearby airport.\n\nFeatured in Bloomberg Businessweek, June 13 - 26, 2016. Subscribe now. Illustrations: Ana Benaroya (flying car); Armando Veve\n\nTurns out, Zee.Aero doesn’t belong to Google or its holding company, Alphabet. It belongs to Larry Page, Google’s co-founder. Page has personally funded Zee.Aero since its launch in 2010 while demanding that his involvement stay hidden from the public, according to 10 people with intimate knowledge of the company. Zee.Aero, however, is just one part of Page’s plan to usher in an age of personalized air travel, free from gridlocked streets and the cramped indignities of modern flight. Like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, Page is using his personal fortune to build the future of his childhood dreams.\n\nThe Zee.Aero headquarters, located at 2700 Broderick Way, is a 30,000-square-foot, two-story white building with an ugly, blocky design and an industrial feel. Page initially restricted the Zee.Aero crew to the first floor, retaining the second floor for a man cave worthy of a multibillionaire: bedroom, bathroom, expensive paintings, a treadmill-like climbing wall, and one of SpaceX’s first rocket engines—a gift from his pal Musk. As part of the secrecy, Zee.Aero employees didn’t refer to Page by name; he was known as GUS, the guy upstairs. Soon enough, they needed the upstairs space, too, and engineers looked on in awe as GUS’s paintings, exercise gear, and rocket engine were hauled away.\n\n“What appears in the next 5 to 10 years will be incredible”\n\nZee.Aero now employs close to 150 people. Its operations have expanded to an airport hangar in Hollister, about a 70-minute drive south from Mountain View, where a pair of prototype aircraft takes regular test flights. The company also has a manufacturing facility on NASA’s Ames Research Center campus at the edge of Mountain View. Page has spent more than $100 million on Zee.Aero, say two of the people familiar with the company, and he’s not done yet. Last year a second Page-backed flying-car startup, Kitty Hawk, began operations and registered its headquarters to a two-story office building on the end of a tree-lined cul-de-sac about a half-mile away from Zee’s offices. Kitty Hawk’s staffers, sequestered from the Zee.Aero team, are working on a competing design. Its president, according to 2015 business filings, was Sebastian Thrun, th­e godfather of Google’s self-driving car program and the founder of research division Google X. Page and Google declined to speak about Zee.Aero or Kitty Hawk, as did Thrun.\n\nFlying cars, of course, are ridiculous. Lone-wolf inventors have tried to build them for decades, with little to show for their efforts besides disappointed investors and depleted bank accounts. Those failures have done little to lessen the yearning: In the nerd hierarchy of needs, the flying car is up there with downloadable brains and a working holodeck.\n\nBut better materials, autonomous navigation systems, and other technical advances have convinced a growing body of smart, wealthy, and apparently serious people that within the next few years we’ll have a self-flying car that takes off and lands vertically—or at least a small, electric, mostly autonomous commuter plane. About a dozen companies around the world, including startups and giant aerospace manufacturers, are working on prototypes. Furthest along, it appears, are the companies Page is quietly funding. “Over the past five years, there have been these tremendous advances in the under­lying technology,” says Mark Moore, an aeronautical engineer who’s spent his career designing advanced aircraft at NASA. “What appears in the next 5 to 10 years will be incredible.”\n\nNorthern California in particular has had a long fascination with flying cars. In 1927 a now mostly forgotten ­engineer named Alexander Weygers first began thinking up the design for a flying saucer that could zip between rooftops. In 1945 he received a patent for what he described as a “­discopter,” a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) machine with room inside for passengers to walk around, cook, and sleep. He depicted smaller versions landing in pods atop buildings in downtown San Francisco. No discopters were built, though it’s believed that the U.S. Army, which paid visits to Weygers’s compound in Carmel Valley, Calif., tinkered with a prototype.\n\nToday, the world’s premier ­flying-car enthusiast is Paul Moller, 79, a professor emeritus at the University of California at Davis. Fifty years ago, when he was teaching mechanical and aeronautical engineering, he developed a specific vision: an aircraft you could park in your garage, drive a few blocks to a small runway, then take skyward. He tested his first prototype, the XM-2, in 1966. The XM-2 resembled a flying saucer with a seat at its center protected by a plastic bubble. It managed an altitude of 4 feet, while graduate students held it steady with ropes. “We were worried if the machine got out of control, we might kill a few people,” Moller says.\n\n“Self-flying aircraft is so much easier than what the auto companies are trying to do with self-driving cars”\n\nIn 1989 his M200X made it to 50 feet above the ground. Then came the M150 Skycar, the M400 Skycar, the 100LS, the 200LS, the Neuera 200, and the Firefly, all variations on the same Jetsonian idea. In January 2000, Moller gave a speech on flying cars at the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), the birthplace of the graphical user interface and, for nerds, sacred ground. Afterward, an engineer in his late 20s walked up and said he was interested in the concept but was skeptical that streetworthy personal aircraft were technically feasible; at the time, Moller didn’t recognize young Larry Page.\n\nMoller kept trying. He says he burned through more than $100 million developing his designs and declared personal bankruptcy in 2009.\n\nThat same year, Moore, the NASA researcher, published a paper describing a concept plane called the Puffin. Moore’s big idea was to use electric motors, which are quieter and safer and have far fewer moving parts than internal combustion engines or conventional turbines. “By going to electric propulsion, you get rid of the vast majority of the complexity, cost, and unreliability,” Moore says. “This is why com­panies looking at this area aren’t insane.” Moore credits Musk’s Tesla and other automakers with advancing the technology. “Electric motors were mostly used in industrial settings where they were stationary, and no one cared about their weight that much,” Moore says. “It wasn’t until the automotive industry got interested that they started to get more lightweight.”\n\nCarmakers invested in other areas, too, that are helpful for building small electric planes, particularly batteries and the semiconductors that control them. Self-driving systems, like the kind Google uses in its Koala cars, are perhaps a decade away from mainstream use on the roads, but they may already be good enough for the skies. “Self-flying aircraft is so much easier than what the auto companies are trying to do with self-driving cars,” Moore says.\n\nMoore’s paper circulated, rekindling excitement. Sometime in 2009, a small group of engineers had begun meeting in Silicon Valley to discuss funding an electric-plane project. One of them was JoeBen Bevirt, a mechanical engineer and entrepreneur who had studied under Moller at UC Davis. Another was Ilan Kroo, an aeronautics and astronautics professor at Stanford. And another was Page. Although it initially looked as if they might all team up, Kroo and Page broke off to start Zee.Aero. Alone, Bevirt founded Joby Aviation, a company he hopes will beat Zee.Aero to market and prove that his efforts with Moller—and the older man’s life’s work—weren’t in vain.\n\nBevirt owns a 500-acre compound near Santa Cruz, Calif. To get there, you turn onto idyllic California State Route 1 and drive past the boardwalk, a few blocks of strip malls, and 15 miles of undeveloped, windswept coastal dunes. Then you turn onto a dirt road, pass a lake and a grove of towering redwoods, and walk through gardens overflowing with lavender and roses. It’s here that Bevirt has built a series of workshops, plus housing for about half of his 35 employees.\n\nBevirt grew up nearby on an electricity-free commune where his mom worked as a midwife and his father built custom homes. From a young age, he learned his way around toolboxes and construction sites, and was an avid reader. After consuming the sci-fi classic The Forever Formula in elementary school, he decided he wanted to build the kind of personal aircraft the book’s hero flew and persuaded a friend to help. “We built lots of prototypes, but they always crashed and burned,” he says. They shifted to custom bikes.\n\nThe flying-car dream stuck with Bevirt as he entered UC Davis in 1991 to study mechanical engineering, and he quickly found himself working for Moller, building one prototype after another. Bevirt eventually concluded their shared dream wouldn’t be feasible until battery and motor technology improved. He figured he’d need to wait 20 years. “Paul had been working on this for 30 years, and he was 50 years ahead of his time,” he says.\n\nBevirt got his bachelor’s, and then a master’s in mechanical engineering from Stanford. He worked in biotech after graduation, co-founding a company called Velocity11 that built robots to sequence DNA. His next company, called Joby (his childhood nickname), sold camera accessories such as flexible plastic tripods. Joby turned Bevirt into a multimillionaire. In 2008 he started Joby Energy, a maker of airborne wind turbines whose technology Google later acquired. The 20-year mark was approaching, so in 2009 he also used some of his wealth to buy the 500 acres and start Joby Aviation.\n\nIts headquarters is an engineer’s fantasyland. The focal point is a large wooden building where two dozen workers sit at a few rows of desks jammed with computers. Aside from the clusters of large black monitors, the place feels more like a barn than an office. Aircraft prototypes hang from the ceiling, as does a thick climbing rope for exercise. In the open kitchen, abutting a long redwood dining table in one corner, a cook uses ingredients from the nearby gardens to prepare three meals a day. While the smell of a Malaysian curry fills the room, a banjo twangs from speakers overhead.\n\nThe manufacturing happens at a series of buildings about 100 yards downhill, past gardens and an outdoor clay pizza oven. One of the buildings is an airy warehouse with a giant oven inside—but this one isn’t for pizza. It’s used to cure the ­carbon-fiber bodies of the planes and looks like a Quonset hut. Former members of Oracle’s America’s Cup sailing team, some of the world’s leading materials experts, oversee the curing process, baking the carbon fiber at about 194F. In another building, engineers build ­cantaloupe-size electric motors; in a third, they test electronics; in a fourth, they put the finishing touches on wings and other parts. Out back, there’s a large truck with an extendible arm atop its trailer like a cherry picker, which hoists propellers high into the air so engineers can perform wind tests while driving down a road at high speed. Robotic prototypes buzz around.\n\nBevirt funded Joby Aviation by himself until last year, when he was joined by Paul Sciarra, one of the co-founders of Pinterest. Sciarra grew up in New Jersey, taught himself to code, hit it big with Pinterest, then went looking for something new to throw himself into. He, too, concluded that electric motors and batteries appeared to have applications well beyond the auto industry. “The goal is to build a product that impacts the lives of lots of people,” Sciarra says. “Not just folks that are amateur pilots or wealthy, but everyone.”\n\nSciarra and Bevirt hope to begin flying a human-scale prototype plane later this year. They won’t give the exact ­specifications but suggest that it could hold, say, a family of four and travel 100 miles or so on a full charge. The vehicle looks like a plane-helicopter hybrid packed with propellers, about eight mounted on the wings and tail. For takeoff and landing, the propellers hang horizontally like a helicopter’s and rotate for forward propulsion once in the air. Joby Aviation has already built smaller prototypes and has models of the plane’s body, wings, and propellers scattered about the manufacturing facilities. Bevirt and Sciarra see the vehicle taking off from parking garages, roofs, or areas alongside highways. They want to offer flights as an Uber-like service—summon a plane when you need it.\n\nThe Joby aircraft looks similar to other vehicles being built around the world. In May the German company E-volo conducted manned flights of its Volocopter, a two-seat aircraft powered by 18 propellers. Other flying-car startups include AeroMobil, Lilium Aviation, and Terrafugia. Even Airbus has built a two-seater prototype at its Silicon Valley labs, say two people familiar with the designs.\n\nIn 2013, Red Bull held one of its Flugtag competitions in Long Beach, Calif. Flugtag is a televised spectacle where hobbyists see how far they can launch their homemade flying machines off a dock. It’s more about entertainment than sustained flight—the contraptions generally dive straight into the water, and everyone laughs. At this one, though, a group called the Chicken Whisperers stunned the assembled crowd. Dressed in full-body baby-chick outfits, the team pushed its glider off the dock and watched as it cruised 258 feet, breaking the previous record of 229 feet. The chickens danced. They clucked. They took a swim in the water. They were all Zee.Aero employees in disguise, having fun, trying out some designs.\n\nIn the six years since its founding, Zee.Aero has hired some of the brightest young aerospace designers, software engineers, and experts in motor and battery hardware. They’ve come from places such as SpaceX, NASA, and Boeing, and they’re all chasing after the goal presented succinctly on Zee.Aero’s spare website: “We’re changing personal aviation.”\n\nAt its outset, Zee.Aero was led by Kroo, the Stanford aerospace professor. He wrote the original Zee.Aero patent, No. 9,242,738, which shows a strange-looking one-seater aircraft with a long, narrow body. Behind the craft’s cockpit, rows of horizontal propellers run along both sides of the body of the plane to handle the VTOL work. There’s also a wing at the back with two more propellers that add forward thrust.\n\nZee.Aero worked on this design for a couple of years. Small, computer-controlled versions of the aircraft were photographed by reporters and hobbyists sitting in the parking lot at 2700 Broderick Way. None of the prototypes were big enough to fit a human.\n\nOver time, the company realized this might not be the best design, according to three former Zee.Aero employees. Page also grew dissatisfied with the rate of progress. In 2015, Kroo returned to teach at Stanford full time but continued to advise Zee.Aero as “principal scientist,” while the com­pany’s engineering chief, Eric Allison, took over as chief executive officer. Under Allison, the company began work on a simpler, more conventional-looking design, now coming to life at the Hollister Municipal Airport.\n\nHollister is a city of about 35,000 nestled among garlic and artichoke farms. Its airport is popular among amateur pilots because of favorable winds and a lack of commercial air traffic. There’s a flight school, a sky-diving business, and a few run-down buildings. The least shabby structure is Building 19, which has been taken over by a dozen or so Zee.Aero workers.\n\nPeople working at the airport have caught glimpses of two Zee.Aero craft in recent months\n\nThe airport is open for business from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, but Zee.Aero employees frequently run test flights when no one else is around. Nonetheless, people working at the airport have caught glimpses of two Zee.Aero craft in recent months. Both have a narrow body, a bulbous cockpit with room for one person upfront, and a wing at the back. In industry lingo, the planes are pushers, with two propellers in the rear. One of the prototypes looks like a small conventional plane; the other has spots for small propellers along the main body, three per side.\n\nWhen the aircraft take off, they sound like air raid sirens.\n\nThe people at the airport haven’t heard Page’s name ­mentioned, but they long ago concluded Zee.Aero’s owner is super rich. Zee.Aero employees receive catered lunches—sometimes $900 worth of barbecue from Armadillo Willy’s, a local chain. Recently, the company purchased a $1 million helicopter to fly alongside the planes and gather data.\n\nFor Page, this project is deeply personal. He’s been known to spend evenings with Musk, both men thinking aloud about ways to fundamentally change transportation. Musk wants to build an upscale electric VTOL jet; Page wants the down-market version. In an interview with a Bloomberg Businessweek reporter a couple of years ago, Page confessed that he longed to take more risks like his industrialist friend. He wanted to dabble with new forms of investment outside the confines of Google and back projects that focused on atoms, not bits. “There’s a lot of money going into internet startup kinds of things, which is great,” he said. “But for some of the real problems we face, I think we need other kinds of investments, too. I have young kids, so I would like them to be safe. I’d like for pedestrians to be much safer. I’d like for blind people and old people and young people to get around.”\n\nThe former Zee.Aero employees describe the company as a fun place to work but don’t downplay the serious expectations from Page. He wants the flying-car future, and he wants it now. If the atmosphere grew tense with Kroo’s departure, it didn’t lighten up when the Kitty Hawk team arrived.\n\nKitty Hawk has about a dozen engineers, including some Zee.Aero veterans. Others came from Aerovelo, a startup whose claim to fame was winning the $250,000 Sikorsky Prize in 2013, for building a human-powered helicopter that could stay aloft for more than a minute. Kitty Hawk employees include Emerick Oshiro, who did self-driving car work at Google, and David Estrada, who handled legal affairs for Google X. They all listed the company as their employer on LinkedIn until they were contacted by Bloomberg Businessweek, at which point they erased any mention of Kitty Hawk from their profiles.\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nPage has drawn a line separating his two flying-car teams, employees say. It’s common for the Zee.Aero engineers to speculate over lunch about what their Kitty Hawk counterparts are up to. The former Zee.Aero employees think Page wanted to see if a smaller team could move faster, and the added pressure on Zee.Aero didn’t hurt. Two people say Kitty Hawk is working on something that resembles a giant version of a quadcopter drone.\n\nThere’s no guarantee that Kitty Hawk’s or Zee.Aero’s or anyone else’s flying cars will ever take to the skies. There are still technology problems to solve, regulatory hurdles to cross, and urgent safety questions to answer. Page once vowed to a colleague that if his involvement in the sector ever became public, he might pull support from the companies.\n\nHere’s hoping that’s not true. If nothing else, these projects show that bold, some might say far-fetched, invention is alive and well in Silicon Valley. The place that spent the past decade focused on social network apps has trained its engineering powers on robots, cars, and now aviation. “We were promised flying cars, and instead what we got was 140 characters,” a local venture capitalist once put it. Page and his cohorts are trying to get us both.", "Google's Project Fi mobile service can save you big bucks, especially if you're traveling internationally. But it might not be a good fit for everyone.\n\nIn this edition of Ask Maggie I explain the ins and outs of Project Fi, Google's wireless service that runs off of the Sprint and T-Mobile networks. I also highlight why some people might want to think twice before ditching their old carrier to join Google's mobile revolution.\n\nDear Maggie,\n\nI'm planning a trip abroad this summer. I read your Ask Maggie column last week that offered advice on how to take your cell phone international without spending an arm and a leg. I saw some comments after the story about Google's Project Fi as an inexpensive alternative to a traditional carrier when traveling. I'm a Verizon customer with an iPhone 6. Should I ditch Verizon and sign up for Project Fi ahead of my trip?\n\nThanks,\n\nConfused About Wireless\n\nDear Confused,\n\nThe short answer to your question is a big \"maybe.\" Project Fi could definitely save you some money, both domestically and abroad. But there are a few limitations you should be aware of before you jump ship.\n\nWhat is Project Fi?\n\nTrio Images/Corbis\n\nProject Fi is Google's attempt to shake up the wireless industry with cheaper plans. The service uses a combination of cellular coverage from T-Mobile and Sprint and local Wi-Fi networks. A key aspect of Project Fi's service is technology that determines which network offers the best connection, allowing it to seamlessly switch among these networks if one connection weakens.\n\nSince its launch last April, Project Fi has largely been an experiment, with the service available only by invitation. Earlier this month, Google opened the service up to everyone, making it easy to sign on.\n\nThe biggest benefit of Project Fi is its low cost. Users in the US pay $20 a month for unlimited calls and texts. Adding data costs $10 for each gigabyte used. If customers don't use their allotted amount in a month, they get a credit for unused data the next month. If you go over your data allotment, you're charged for the additional data. This is appealing to a lot of people, because you truly pay for what you use.\n\nThe great news for international travelers is that you can still get unlimited text messaging and Project Fi doesn't charge roaming rates for data usage in more than 120 countries. This means it still costs $10 per gigabyte of data. This is a huge benefit considering that Verizon charges $2.05 per megabyte of data. (Keep in mind that voice service is charged on a per minute basis, and prices vary depending on the country you're visiting.)\n\nBecause Project Fi is always looking for the best network connection and the service tries to connect you to a Wi-Fi signal, you may actually use less data than you would on a traditional cellular carrier, which will reduce your costs even more. (Wi-Fi is not counted against your monthly data usage.) For your protection, Project Fi uses a secure connection even over public Wi-Fi networks.\n\nOK, so what's the catch?\n\nThe biggest downside for you is that Project Fi is available only on LG's Nexus 5X, Motorola's Nexus 6 and Huawei's Nexus 6P. This means you'd have to buy a new phone and leave the Apple iPhone ecosystem if you wanted to switch to Project Fi.\n\nThe other potential downside is that when you're in the US and Wi-Fi isn't available, you'll be roaming on either Sprint or T-Mobile. Their networks aren't as widespread as Verizon's, so this means that depending on where you live and work, you may get spotty coverage when Wi-Fi isn't available. But if you live and work in an urban area, you may not notice the difference in coverage, since both Sprint and T-Mobile work pretty well in most big US cities. Both have been steadily improving with their 4G speeds as well.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nIf you plan to travel outside the US often and you live in an area where Sprint and T-Mobile coverage isn't an issue, switching to Project Fi and getting a new Nexus 5X, which is now only $199 when bought with Project Fi service, might be the way to go. You'd definitely save money on your trip and you'd likely save money at home.\n\nBut if the trip this summer is a once-in-a-lifetime or even a-once-every-five-years affair, it might not be worth it for you to make the leap, especially if you're satisfied with Verizon at home. The Nexus 5X gets high marks from reviewers, but it's not an iPhone. Some people are happy making the switch between Apple and Android, others aren't. I hope this advice helps.\n\nAsk Maggie is an advice column that answers readers' wireless and broadband questions. If you have a question, I'd love to hear from you.

To attract developers, the app will be free at launch with pricing to be introduced at a later date.\n\nWe’d been hearing murmurs about this service developing for weeks now. The company formally announced the service today during its NEXT cloud user conference, where it also unveiled a raft of other machine learning developments and updates, most significantly a new machine learning platform.\n\nThe Google Cloud Speech API, which will cover over 80 languages and will work with any application in real-time streaming or batch mode, will offer full set of APIs for applications to “see, hear and translate,” Google says. It is based on the same neural network tech that powers Google’s voice search in the Google app and voice typing in Google’s Keyboard. There are some other interesting features, such as working in noisy environments and in real-time.\n\nGoogle’s move will have a large impact on the industry as a whole — and particularly on Nuance, the company long thought of as offering the best voice recognition capabilities in the business, and most certainly the biggest offering such services. A number of Nuance customers, including startups, could leave it in favor of Google’s technology, which not only offers an improved experience over current providers, but will also be made available at a lower cost.\n\nTo attract developer interest initially, the API will be completely free to use. Over time, the API will be paid, but likely have low-cost pricing tiers, we understand. Google may choose to raise those prices over time, after it becomes the dominant player in the industry.\n\nGoogle has offered limited access to its voice technology in its products to date. Developers can make JavaScript calls to the Chrome API, for example, which are then routed to the speech recognition API. And Google announced a Voice Interaction API at Google I/O in 2015, which allows Android developers to add voice interactions to their apps. But Google had yet to open up access to the speech recognition API directly.\n\nThe introduction of the speech API won’t only impact Nuance and other speech recognition providers, but is also being seen as an attack on Apple, whose virtual assistant Siri’s voice recognition capabilities pale in comparison to Google’s. It’s also yet to offer an API for developers to use the Siri tech in their own apps.\n\nThere were hints that Google would be putting a greater emphasis on its voice technology and many use cases. For example, the company announced in February that it would allow Google Docs users to edit and format their documents by voice.\n\nMore to come as we hear about it at the event.", "About the time Swift was going open source, representatives for three major brands — Google, Facebook and Uber — were at a meeting in London discussing the new language. Sources tell The Next Web that Google is considering making Swift a “first class” language for Android, while Facebook and Uber are also looking to make Swift more central to their operations.\n\nGoogle’s Android operating system currently supports Java as its first-class language, and sources say Swift is not meant to replace Java, at least initially. While the ongoing litigation with Oracle is likely cause for concern, sources say Google considers Swift to have a broader “upside” than Java.\n\nEver been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE\n\nSwift is also open source, which means Google could adopt it for Android without changing its own open source mobile structure.\n\nCould Google do it?\n\nBorn at Apple as a replacement to Objective C, Swift quickly found favor with developers as an easy-to-write language that shed much of the verbosity and clumsy parameters other languages have. It was introduced at WWDC 2014, and has major support from IBM as well as a variety of major apps like Lyft, Pixelmator and Vimeo that have all rebuilt iOS apps with Swift.\n\nSwift can’t be copy-pasted for any platform, though. Specifically, Android would need a runtime for Swift — and that’s just for starters.\n\nGoogle would also have to make its entire standard library Swift-ready, and support the language in APIs and SDKs. Some low-level Android APIs are C++, which Swift can not currently bridge to. Those would have to be re-written.\n\nSwift would also not be useful in bridging higher level APIs in Java; they’d have to be re-written as well.\n\nUsing Swift for Android is not impossible, though. Late last year, developer Romain Goyet toyed with Swift for Android — and had some success. While that project was completed well ahead of Swift being open source, it nonetheless proved that it can be done.\n\nThat project used the Android NDK, which allows other languages to be loosely implemented into Android. With an open source Swift and support from Google, Android apps wouldn’t require that toolkit.\n\nAll told, Google would have to effectively recreate its efforts with Java — for Swift. If the company is motivated enough, it’s very possible to do so without compromising on its open source values or ruffling any developer feathers along the way.\n\nKotlin\n\nJust reaching its potential, sources also claim Kotlin is being discussed as a first class language for Android.\n\nLike Swift, Kotlin is object oriented with a focus on safety. Unlike Swift, Kotlin works with Android Studio, Google’s IDE for Android development.\n\nUnfortunately, sources tell The Next Web that Google’s current mindset is that Kotlin is a bit too slow when compiling.\n\nBut, Kotlin is billed as a language that “works everywhere Java works,” and has “seamless” support for projects that mix it and Java.\n\nIt would be much less work on Google’s end to get Kotlin up and running for Android, but could be a tedious transition for developers.\n\nFacebook and Uber\n\nFacebook’s interest in Swift appears to be completely founded in technological advancement.\n\nA benefit of Swift is that it can serve as both a forward-facing language as well as a server-side one. For a product like Facebook, that’s beneficial; apps and servers can speak to one another seamlessly, and it potentially gives the company a wider scope to write APIs for services.\n\nAnd work may have already begun. A Github pull request in the Swift repository named ‘Port to Android’ was made by a Facebook employee. It’s not clear if his work was official Facebook business or not, though we have confirmed Facebook is already working with Swift internally — it’s just not known how thoroughly.\n\nUber’s road to Swift is probably a bit cleaner than either Google or Facebook. Though there are many moving parts to Uber’s service (app, server and API), it can use Lyft’s transition to Swift as an example.\n\nWhen Lyft migrated its iOS app to Swift, it was a ground-up remodel that took a lot of time and effort — but resulted in an app that’s lighter, leaner and easier to maintain. It’s not known how much (if any) of Lyft’s back-end uses Swift, but the company has been highly complimentary of Swift in its existing application.\n\nWhen could a move to Swift happen?\n\nThe short answer: not anytime soon. The reason? Android.\n\nBut Swift is quickly finding its way. Several studies suggest it’s one of the fastest growing languages around, and has blown up since going open source (GitHub tells The Next Web the language is currently its 11th most popular). Demand for developers who know Swift is also exploding, which could be all the indication these three companies need to at least explore using Swift more thoroughly.\n\nGoogle’s onboarding for Swift would be long; it essentially has to rewrite every Android service, app and API. Google would also have to spearhead Swift support for Android — which is still only being poked and prodded at by clever developers in the Swift community.\n\nIn a way, Google has already begun moving away from bits of Oracle-flavored Java. It’s now using the Open JDK for Android rather than the proprietary Java API, and may be considering a post-Java life altogether. Talks in London were said to be exploratory; Google is not yet pushing to move on from Java. While it would be a big undertaking, Swift is meant for speed and safety, and Swift’s roadmap suggests it won’t be quite as difficult to use it for other platforms in the future, specifically when it comes to C++.\n\nThough Kotlin is an alternative, it’s a very nascent language without the eager community Swift has.\n\nFacebook and Uber face similarly daunting tasks when it comes to using Swift throughout, but can –and should — wait for Google to shoulder the load with Android. If the use of Swift is going to be as deep as our sources indicate (that is, all companies want to be using it for server side and forward-facing use cases), Android support is integral.\n\nMoving to Swift for any of the companies also makes little sense unless it’s a thorough re-do, but it’s probably not quite as hard as it sounds. Services like Perfect prove that server-side Swift is ready, and it’s worth considering that Facebook’s engineers (perhaps from the Parse team) may already be working on this.\n\nIBM is also working to make Swift ready for server-side functions.\n\nBut don’t expect Google, Facebook or Uber to announce Swift-y plans anytime soon. Facebook and Google both have developer conferences on the horizon, and there’s no indication that Swift will play a major part at either.\n\nWe reached out to all three companies for comment on the information our sources brought forward. All three declined to comment. Google specifically pointed to its ongoing litigation with Oracle as reason not to participate in this article. Make of that what you will.\n\nRead next: Twelve South made a travel case for Apple Watch you'll actually want to use", "The thing about Vine becoming the internet’s premier tool for making short-form videos is that it happened almost completely by accident. Its founders had envisioned their tool for making 6-second clips as a way to help people capture casual moments in their lives and share them with friends. It was part of their pitch to Twitter, which bought the company for a reported $30 million in October 2012, seeing it as a near-perfect video analog to its flagship app’s short-form text posts.\n\nAnd yet even before the app launched, users had taken the 6-second constraint as a creative challenge. Something about that loop — the way a Vine endlessly rewound itself after completing, like a GIF with audio — encouraged people to put the app to strange uses. “It was surprising,” said Dom Hofmann, who founded Vine with Rus Yusupov and Colin Kroll four months before Twitter bought it. “Our original beta had something like 10 or 15 people on it, and even with that small group we started to see experimentation pretty early on.”\n\nWithin weeks, it appeared that Vine probably would never become the everyday video sharing tool its founders had envisioned. Instead it became something wilder — and much more culturally interesting. “It became pretty clear as soon after we launched,” Hofmann said. “Watching the community and the tool push on each other was exciting and unreal, and almost immediately it became clear that Vine’s culture was going to shift towards creativity and experimentation.”\n\n“It immediately became clear that Vine’s culture was going to shift towards creativity.”\n\nOn Thursday, the experimentation came to an end. With its own future increasingly uncertain, Twitter said it would shut down Vine’s mobile app some time in the next few months. And while existing Vines will remain on the web, a media format that had become beloved for its versatility now appears headed the way of Betamax.\n\nInterviews with seven former executives reveal a portrait of a company whose cultural impact far outstripped its strategic benefits to Twitter. Working a continent apart from their parent company, Vine’s small, New York-based team struggled to grow its user base or find ways to make money. While Vine once boasted a commanding lead over other social video apps, it failed to keep pace as competitors added features — something that ultimately drove its biggest stars away. The app generated more beloved memes and cultural moments than most apps with twice as many users — but Twitter’s mounting core business problems this year all but ensured it would eventually be sold off or shuttered.\n\nIan Padgham saw the potential in Vine — both creative and monetary — before almost anyone. As a member of Twitter’s marketing team in 2012, he was responsible for making videos that explained how the service worked. (His early film about working at Twitter is likely one of the most-watched recruiting videos ever made.) After Twitter bought Vine, he sat in on meetings with the marketing team and began to explore its potential as a creative tool.\n\nPadgham’s first Vine was a simple time-lapse video of the view from his window at Twitter. He loved the 6-second limit, which forced him to think differently about storytelling. “It’s kind of like drawing in Microsoft Paint,” he said. “It used to be the worst app ever, but you couldn’t get distracted by the bells and whistles.”\n\n“You couldn’t get distracted by the bells and whistles.”\n\nPadgham began making Vines every day before he left for work, and they soon grew both in popularity and in ambition. He cut out 300 photo prints and spent three hours painstakingly turning them into a tribute to Eadweard Muybridge, a photographer who did pioneering work in motion pictures. He stood underneath Big Ben and recorded a time lapse of himself appearing to move the hands of the clock with his fingers, a loop that was viewed more than 5 million times. Soon brands like Sony and Airbnb were contacting Padgham asking him to make Vines on their behalf, and six months after Vine launched he quit Twitter to do it full time.\n\nIn 2013, Vine began allowing users to record clips with their phones’ front-facing cameras, and usage exploded. An ecosystem of young stars sprung up around the service, which evolved into a kind of live-action cartoon network. There was Zach King, whose eye-popping magic tricks earned him 4 million followers and more than 1.4 billion views. Or Amanda Cerny, whose physical comedy earned more than 2.2 billion views. Logan Paul, whose Vines looped more than 4 billion times, parlayed his following into a series of acting roles — while earning $200,000 to create a single Vine for a brand, according to a recent 60 Minutes report.\n\nIn a 2014 look at how video platforms were creating the next generation of celebrities, The New Yorker put Vine at the center. “A Vine’s blink-quick transience, combined with its endless looping, simultaneously squeezes time and stretches it,” Tad Friend wrote. The app generated countless memes, and grew increasingly self-referential over time, so that a single 6-second clip might reference a dozen previous hit Vines. And yet in retrospect it seems clear that 2014 was when Vine peaked. Research firm 7Park Data says 3.64 percent of all Android users opened Vine in August 2014; today that number has fallen to 0.66 percent. (Twitter never said how many people used Vine, but once claimed it had an audience of 200 million people on the web.)\n\nFormer executives say that a major competitive challenged emerged in the form of Instagram, which introduced 15-second video clips in June 2013. “Instagram video was the beginning of the end,” one former executive told me. “[Vine] didn’t move fast enough to differentiate.” Instagram courted celebrities with longer videos, eventually bumping the limit to a more flexible 60 seconds. (Vines didn’t break the 6-second barrier until earlier this year, and its extended videos never caught on.) Instagram also began promoting celebrity accounts in its popular “explore” tab, bringing them attention that Vine found difficult to match. Marketers began shifting their money away from Vine, and stars followed.\n\n“Vine didn’t move fast enough to differentiate.”\n\nMeanwhile Snapchat, which allowed users to send each other 10-second video clips and (later) broadcast them publicly, ultimately became the casual mass-market lifecasting app that Vine’s founders had once pitched their product to Twitter as. When other platforms surged ahead, some Vine stars began negotiating to be paid to post on the service. But the talks stalled, and by May the Washington Post found that Vine users with large followings were sharing new videos much less frequently.\n\nAt the management level, Vine was rarely stable for long. Hofmann quit in 2014 to pursue a new startup. Kroll followed him out the door later that year. Twitter laid off Yusupov, who was Vine’s creative director, as part of last year’s mass layoffs. (“Don’t sell your company!”, he tweeted on Thursday.) Jason Toff took over Vine in 2014 and led it for two years before quitting this year to work on virtual reality projects at Google. Hannah Donovan became general manager in March after working at a series of music startups. Her lack of previous experience running a company led some employees I spoke with to question whether her hiring might be the beginning of the end.\n\nYears of executive churn likely contributed to Vine’s failure to make money. For a while, brands were happy to pay Vine stars directly to make ads and share them to their millions of followers. But after Snapchat and Instagram grew into hundreds of millions of daily users, marketers’ interest in Vine dropped significantly. They had once longed for ways to grow their own followings on the app — through paid placement offerings similar to Twitter’s promoted tweets and promoted accounts.But Vine never came through with any options, in part because the founders resisted monetization from the start, sources said. It never took a cut of stars’ deals with brands, although Twitter bought a social media talent agency last year in hopes it could begin to do so indirectly.\n\nBy this year, Twitter executives were discussing ways to bring Twitter’s various video offerings together somehow, sources said. In June, the company held discussions about absorbing Vine into Twitter’s flagship app. To Vine employees, those discussions served as evidence that Twitter never valued Vine as a standalone property the way its audience did. But no Vine integration ever materialized, and this summer top Vine executives began heading for the exits. Twitter explored selling the app, according to the New York Times, but it never found a buyer.\n\n“Vine didn’t ship anything of consequence for a year.”\n\n“A couple of things plagued Vine, and it all stems from the same thing, which is a lack of unity and leadership on a vision,” said Ankur Thakkar, who was Vine’s head of editorial from 2014 until May of this year. He told me he was proud of the work the app did to highlight rising stars, including Ruth B, who earned a record deal after his team gave her a coveted “editor’s pick” award. But by the end the company was rudderless, he said. “That trickled down into all of the project teams and the things they were working on,” he said. “Vine didn’t ship anything of consequence for a year.”\n\nThe stars who grew famous on Vine continue posting their work on other platforms. But they’re no longer pushing the surprisingly elastic boundaries of the 6-second medium. “The most important of part of Vine has always been the people that are on it,” Dom Hofmann told me. “It’s also the only part that can’t be replicated. So I’m going to miss them. Even though I can and do follow some people from Vine on Instagram or Snapchat or Twitter or wherever they’ve decided to go, it just doesn’t feel the same. It’s like the band is breaking up and everyone’s going solo.”", "It's no secret that Google knows a lot about you.

Actually, scratch that: Google is calling this year's event an \"outdoor developer festival\", so grab your party hat and get ready to celebrate all things Android, Chrome, and more.\n\nThe Google IO 2017 dates are May 17 through May 19, and it's all going down at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif., where the gathering was held in 2016.\n\nWe're still digesting everything Google announced at last year's edition, including Google Assistant, Google Home , the Allo and Duo apps, details on Android Nougat (though it didn't have that name at the time), the Daydream VR platform, Android Wear 2.0 and Android Instant Apps.\n\nThis year's event looks to be just as exciting, or at least we're led to believe there will be extra pep in Google's step due to how the IO dates and location were revealed; earlier this year, Google came up with an elaborate puzzle for developers to solve to unearth the details.\n\nAround the world, from here to there, to the most clever minds, the secret will share. #googledevs #savethedate https://t.co/0zwCbSLzVy pic.twitter.com/0O2vNDWZx2January 24, 2017\n\nIf you're a developer and interested in Google IO 2017 registration, hop over to the Google IO website to begin the sign-up process (note: you must be invited to register).\n\nWhile this \"festival\" is geared towards developers, it's also relevant for anyone interested in Android, Chrome, phones, tablets, smart home devices, new applications, virtual reality and, among other moonshots, self-driving cars.\n\nTo get ready for the main event, read on for all the news and rumors we've heard so far about Google IO 2017!\n\nSay hello to Android O\n\nThe star of IO, as is tradition, will be the newest flavor of Android. Following in alphabetic order – Android Nougat is the most recent release – Google will officially welcome Android O come May.\n\nWhile we don't know the next version of Android's official name yet (are we in for another submission process?), Android Oreo seems to be the front-runner right now.\n\nWhat will likely happen is Google will talk about its next mobile OS update at IO, yet hold off launching it till later in the year. Considering Android 7.0 Nougat didn't publicly release until August 2016, this will probably be the case for Android O.\n\nBut what exactly are we in for with Android O? Christmas came early as Google announced the Android O developer preview in mid-March, giving us a look at some early features available in the operating system.\n\nOne of the most exciting features of the build, which is targeted at developers, is \"Background limits\". This will make apps less taxing on your device's battery by making limits more transparent to developers. The feature looks to do for your battery life what Data Saver did for wireless bills.\n\nThere's also picture-in-picture for watching videos while doing other tasks, updates to notifications, including snooze, and animation support for all app icons.\n\nOne final Android O goodie of note is that Sony worked with Google to bring the company's LDAC codec to Android O devices, which will deliver improved audio quality over Bluetooth for your listening pleasure.\n\nAs Android looks to stay competitive with the iOS operating system, look for Google to talk up any and all ways Android O bests Apple's platform.\n\nWhat's the word on Android Wear 2.0?\n\nAndroid Wear 2.0 launched in February, so while it's unlikely for Google to announce a major update to its revamped wearable operating system at IO, we expect there to be some talk related to the wrist.\n\nFor starters, if Android Wear 2.0 hasn't arrived on all old smartwatches by then, we could be in for an announcement regarding that very thing.\n\nWe wouldn't be surprised if Android Wear 2.0 apps are announced either, and we could even see a brand-new smartwatch. No rumblings of said watch have started yet, but there's plenty of time before the show.\n\nWith Motorola the biggest hold out of the latest version of Android Wear to date, perhaps a spectacular Google IO reveal is in store? Just a thought.\n\nGoogle Home invasion\n\nGoogle introduced its first smart speaker at Google IO 2016 in the form of Google Home (how many times can you write \"Google\" in a sentence, amiright?), and this year could see an updated version of the device or new features available to the original.\n\nThe strongest rumor to date is that Google is planning to add phone calling to Home , allowing users to communicate via voice through the speaker.\n\nConsidering Google already has its Project Fi and Google Voice services up and running, it may not be too much of a stretch for Google Home to suddenly find its calling chops. Phone calling is also reportedly in the running for chief rival Amazon Echo, which does put the pressure on Google to deliver the feature sooner rather than later.\n\nAnother possible feature for Google Home is multiple user support, which we could see introduced at IO.\n\nGoogle Chrome improvement\n\nAnother area of focus at Google IO will be Chrome, and could include everything from new Chromebooks to improved browser features.\n\nThe most likely developments we'll hear about though are features such as Android apps working on all future Chromebooks . As Google and other tech giants look to more closely tie mobile and computing operating systems together, Google will almost certainly discuss how it's accomplishing this for the benefit of developers, and the audience watching at home.\n\nNew Pixel phones? Perhaps\n\nGoogle just announced the Pixel and Pixel XL phones in October 2016, but rumors have been heating up that already the Pixel 2 , Pixel 2 XL and even a Pixel XXL (though we doubt it will be called that) are in the works.\n\nIt's possible Google could unveil new mobile devices at IO 2017, though we're putting this in the not-very-likely category.\n\nNot only is the distance just a little too close to the first devices' release, but Google's head of hardware said Google is planning to stick to an annual release cycle with the devices, which puts a launch date later in the year. He did, however, confirm new Pixel smartphones are coming, so at least we have that.\n\nVirtual reality, Chromecast and everything else\n\nThere's no doubt Google will announce products, services and/or updates outside of these core categories at IO 2017. Here's what else we may see:\n\nThough, like Pixel, it may be too early for the Google Daydream View 2, there's a strong chance we'll have news on the VR front from the Big G. Perhaps a headset price reduction, or updates in how developers create and publish content for virtual reality?\n\nWith Google Play looking to promote great apps and games across all hardware platforms , we wouldn't be surprised to see plenty of time devoted to this very topic in front of the developer crowd.\n\nOn the home entertainment front, whispers are circulating that Google Assistant may become available on more third-party devices, expanding its roots beyond the Nvidia Shield 2017 , where the digital helper already makes a home. This would certainly make sense to do, and an announcement on additional partners could be in the cards.\n\nOther possibilities include updates to Android TV, though those will likely be minor if any are announced.\n\nWe could also be in for a new Chromecast things have been relatively quiet regarding the streaming disc since the Chromecast Ultra went on sale.\n\nThe last potential IO agenda item we can speak to with some authority right now is Hangouts, and by a larger measure, all of Google's messaging platforms.\n\nGoogle recently announced two new Hangouts offerings geared towards enterprise users – Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat – but there was quickly confusion as to whether the consumer version of Hangouts would stick around or, as was suggested, the newer Duo and Allo apps would take the place of average-user chat services.\n\nThis is not even to mention the revamped Google Voice service Google rolled out in January.\n\nThere are clearly too many Google-branded messaging platforms, and perhaps Google will finally be ready to drop what's not working and focus on making a few great chat offerings. In fact, it already started a chat app clearing out in late March.\n\nThis is still somewhat wishful thinking given Google's track record, but IO could be a turning point for Google, one where it stops introducing new chat apps and starts building robust platforms everyone actually wants to use." ] }

their ads display on YouTube after marketers pulled business because ads were funding videos of hate speech and terrorism.\n\nGroupM, the world’s largest media buying firm, said it has signed up a company to help ensure that its clients’ ads run against appropriate content. GroupM clients include L'oreal cosmetics, HSBC Bank, Lloyds Banking Group, supermarket chain Tesco and retailer Marks and Spencer. Those five advertisers publicly announced earlier this month they had suspended ads on YouTube in the U.K.\n\nA source close to the situation said Google supplied GroupM with the complete list of YouTube channels in Google’s so-called Preferred advertising program. The list is not publicly available, but other Google clients may also request it. Clients advertising on these channels otherwise receive reports from Google about where ads have already run, but without the list cannot know for certain where their ads could potentially run.\n\nGoogle Preferred includes higher-quality videos or YouTube channels with large followings.\n\nGroupM is using video analytics company OpenSlate to analyze the content of channels on the list GroupM obtained. This will allow GroupM to determine ahead of time where ads from their clients should run. OpenSlate will earn a commission when GroupM's clients use the monitoring service, according to GroupM.\n\nThe media buyer said Google already made similar third-party analysis possible in other areas, but that this was the first time it was possible with preferred content.\n\nOpenSlate does not have a contract with Google or special access to the company’s data, Google confirmed.\n\nLast month, Google removed a popular YouTube creator from its preferred advertising program over issues with hate speech in the creator’s videos. The Wall Street Journal found that Felix Kjellberg, known as PewDiePie, had posted several anti-Semitic videos. Disney subsidiary Maker Studios cut ties with Kjellberg following the discovery.\n\nWith 53 million subscribers, PewDiePie’s channel was one of the most popular on YouTube and was considered “brand safe” until the Journal pointed out the inappropriate content. The revelation highlighted the risk of social video content for brands seeking to advertise.\n\nUpdate: This post has been updated to include more details about information Google gave GroupM and to clarify OpenSlate’s relationship with GroupM and Google.", "Smartwatches are having a rough time. No matter what your chosen platform, sales are mostly down, hardware is mostly bulky, software is mostly slow, and battery life is mostly poor. The industry in general seems to be pivoting towards a slew of similar Android Wear watches where the main difference is in what fashion brand logo they bear.\n\nBut yet, there are still dreamers like the folks behind the Dagadam Watch, which is looking for backing on Kickstarter. Now, there’s nothing wrong with the Dagadam’s hardware on its own — it’s a nice enough looking (if a bit thick) touchscreen smartwatch that uses an interesting touch bezel control scheme and has a claimed three days of battery life. But the idea of launching an independent third-party smartwatch based on a proprietary software platform in today’s market just seems incredibly foolhardy.\n\nThere are two, maybe three viable full smartwatch platforms right now\n\nAs it stands, there are two, maybe three viable smartwatch platforms right now:\n\nApple Watch, because Apple also makes iPhones and refuses to allow anyone else to have similar levels of integration into iOS. That means that unlike third parties like Pebble, Apple can integrate iMessage and allow Apple Watch apps to be bundled together with the iPhone apps you already have installed.\n\nAndroid Wear, which has a similar advantage, allowing developers to easily tie their existing Android apps into Google’s smartwatch platform. That gives Android Wear great third-party support, with the added backing of Google’s massive software chops.\n\nAnd Samsung’s Galaxy Gear line, which is probably the closest comparison to something like the Dagadam. Recent Gear watches also run their own proprietary platform with more limited developer support than Android Wear or the Apple Watch; but unlike the Dagadam, where the success or failure of the company is riding on a single product, Samsung is a multi-billion dollar corporation that has the resources to keep the Gear line going for years, even if it sells poorly.\n\nThat’s it. The next closest we’ve ever had to a viable third party contender was Pebble, which despite having literally everything going for it — first to market, great design, outstanding battery life, positive reviews, dedicated customers, and hundreds of millions of dollars in funding — still couldn’t beat the established players. It was recently sold on the cheap to Fitbit and won’t be making or supporting its hardware anymore.\n\nSure, the Dagadam Watch has made its $100,000 funding goal on Kickstarter. It’ll hopefully ship to backers, despite coming from a first time company. But even if somehow the Dagadam Watch has, bar none, the single greatest smartwatch hardware and interface ever made, beating out Apple’s billions of dollars in R&D and Google’s teams of top software engineers — which is about as realistic as thinking that your crowdfunded smartphone will somehow top the Galaxy S8 or Apple’s next iPhone — it still won’t matter so long as Apple and Google have total control over the playing field.\n\nSmartwatches are still too tied to a smartphone\n\nI’m not saying that more competition in this market would be bad — competition is great! But there’s no way around the fact that the technology we have today for smartwatches is simply too tied to a host smartphone for core functionality. And when you rely on a smartphone, Apple, Google, and even Samsung have such a home court advantage that it’s nearly impossible for even the scrappiest Kickstarter to overcome. It was a core factor in hastening Pebble’s demise, and it’ll continue to shut down future contenders until smartwatches can somehow break free of their inherent reliance on smartphones.\n\nAnd cutting the tether to smartphones is a tough task. Adding LTE might be able to do it, but you’ll need a bigger, more power-hungry radio — which of course means even worse battery life and a chunkier watch — along with the added cost of separate cellular service. And the efforts we’ve seen so far in that vein have come across more as hobbled smartphones than truly independent smartwatches.\n\nAll hope isn’t lost in the watch industry — hybrid smartwatches that simply track fitness data and buzz for notifications are far less reliant on a tethered smartphone, and increasingly could be the future of wearables. But for now, it’s hard to look at any third party smartwatch like the Dagadam as anything but an exercise in futility.", "Last week, Google found itself in the center of a firestorm regarding the ad placement controversy, with many high-profile clients pulling their ads from Google/Alphabet owned unit, YouTube. Although the company is still not completely out of the unpleasant situation, judging by yesterday's tiny bounce in the stock, the worst could be in the rear-view mirror.\n\nGoogle has stated that they are working to solve the problem but as of late last week, there were some ads still popping up alongside questionable content on YouTube.\n\nGoogle shares lost about 4.5% last week as investors were quick to pull the trigger, which they are inclined to do and then worry about the questions later. That shaved about $22 billion off Google's market capitalization last week.\n\nYesterday, our futures were deep in the red to start off the trading week on the latest Wall Street-generated fear event, which was the failure to repeal Obamacare by the Trump administration. Shares of Google opened at $828 per share, hit a low of $824 per share and change and then, as calmer minds prevailed, closed the day at $838.51 per share, up 0.40% for the day.\n\nAs one can surmise, the analysts that follow Google on Wall Street had a lot to say on the topic.\n\nUBS came out with an update that said that it was not hearing anything that would cause the analyst to change its long term estimates on the company and that it was keeping its Buy rating and maintaining its $980 price target on Google. In addition, based on its contacts in the industry, many clients quickly took advantage of the situation to try and negotiate better ad rates from Google. That indicates to me that a majority of the clients have already moved past the issue and are trying to turn the situation to their advantage. Not a bad thing, no?", "Voice assistants have been all the rage in the past few months, and when Samsung took the wraps off its flagship Galaxy S8 smartphone, it also acquainted the world with Bixby.\n\nIt's Samsung's attempt to take on the likes of Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant in a move described by one analyst as the \"most important\" in the company's history.\n\nTechnology giants are in a race to take the lead in voice, which is seen as one of the key ways people will be interacting with not only their phones, but all connected devices, particularly in the home.

Sandler also started coverage of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook at overweight.\n\nThe closely watched, big-cap FANG stocks — Facebook, Amazon, video streamer Netflix (NFLX) and Google — have delivered for investors, says Sandler.\n\n\"We think the appeal of FANG is not only its strong fundamentals, but also its unique ability for investors to size up/down positions quickly due to its larger market cap and liquidity,\" said Sandler. \"In 5 of the past 7 years, FANG has outperformed the non-FANG stocks in our universe on a market cap-weighted basis, and we expect that trend to continue with more power accruing to the largest names in the space of late from key technology trends and consolidation.\"\n\nFacebook shares rose 0.6% in late afternoon trade on the stock market today, hitting a new all-time high. Alphabet climbed 1.2%, retaking its 50-day moving average after tumbling last week on YouTube ad concerns. Amazon rose 2.2% to 875, setting record highs. Netflix grew 1%, on track for an all-time closing high.\n\nEven so, Sandler says Google and Facebook will face hurdles.\n\n\"In order for Facebook, Google and others to hit consensus figures for 2020, mobile advertising needs to add around $42 billion in aggregate in North America alone and get to the same size as the TV advertising market today,\" Sandler said in a report.\n\n\"For Facebook and Google to hit consensus estimates from now until 2020, they need to take nearly 80% of every incremental dollar of mobile ad spend,\" he added. \"This doesn't seem to offer a significant amount of upside given the emergence of Snap (SNAP) and Amazon in the mobile ad space recently.\"\n\nIBD'S TAKE: China's Momo and Weibo along with Facebook are the top-rated stocks in IBD's Internet-Content group, which is ranked No. 97 out of 197 industry groups. See the other top-rated internet companies and how they stack up vs. objective fundamental and technical data at IBD Stock Checkup.\n\nSandler says small-cap internet stocks also have been solid performers vs. their large-cap peers.\n\nThe Barclays analyst rated social media firm Snap at equal weight, as well as Shopify (SHOP) and Web.com (WEB). GoDaddy (GDDY) was started at overweight.\n\nSandler initiated Chinese internet stocks Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), Alibaba Holdings (BABA) and Weibo (WB) at overweight.\n\n\"We believe the next five-plus years for consumer internet stocks could be the 'golden years' for mobile, whereby most companies have transitioned their business and monetization is rapidly improving, and the next disruptive technologies to take users away from smartphones have yet to gain traction,\" Sandler added.\n\nRELATED:\n\nFacebook Plays Copycat, Makes Snap Stock Rebound Disappear\n\nWill Tesla Self-Driving Cars, Chinese Cloud Give This AI Tech Stock A Lift?\n\nFANG Stocks News: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google", "Reports of ransomware infecting Android devices are often sensational, yet According to Google fewer than 0.00001% of app installs from Google Play have ever contained ransomware. You're more likely to be struck by lightning twice, the company notes.\n\nImage: Google\n\nThat's not to say ransomware isn't a very serious issue and you don't need to give it a second thought while you're using your Android device. It never hurts to exercise caution, especially when a device contains as much sensitive information as your phone or tablet.\n\nThe good news is that Google has already done a lot of the work for you. It has built numerous protections into Android to keep ransomware -- and all kinds of other threats -- from infiltrating your device.\n\nIf you're among the roughly 3% of users running Android 7 Nougat, you're in the best shape. Google implemented several new features that can fend off ransomware, like \"safety blinders,\" which keeps apps from finding out what other apps are running. Nougat also introduced protections against clickjacking, a technique attackers use to trick you into clicking buttons you can't see to kickstart malware.\n\nGoogle has made it impossible for a malicious app to change your PIN, too. That's a common way ransomware apps have locked users out of their devices, and it reinforces just how important it is to set up a PIN or other lock.\n\nAndroid apps are also sandboxed for safety. They run inside isolated virtual containers so that they can't poke around where they're not supposed to. It's not impossible to break out of a sandbox, but it is very, very difficult.\n\nImage: Google\n\nThere's also the Verify Apps feature, which has been around for years. Verify Apps scans for suspicious behavior, blocks them, and in very serious situations will even remove them from your device -- all without you lifting a finger.\n\nHow You Can Help\n\nSo what can you do to avoid getting a ransomware infection on your Android device? The first step is one that I've mentioned before: don't mess with the \"untrusted sources\" switch in your settings. Google carefully screens apps in Google Play. Other places you can find Android apps -- like third-party app stores and filesharing sites -- aren't necessarily doing that.\n\nEven if you only download apps from Google Play, Google recommends that you do a little investigation before clicking the install button -- Google's good at keeping threats out of their store, but the odd one can still slip through. Have a look at the app's reviews. See what permissions it will request. If things aren't adding up, skip the install.\n\nAnother super-simple way to protect your device: keep the software on it up-to-date. Making sure you have the latest Android patches and current updates for all your apps goes a long way to keeping malware at bay.", "Google launched a new site that brings all its open source projects under one roof, the company announced Tuesday.\n\nThe new Google Open Source website includes information on how the company uses, releases, and supports open source.

It will contain the expected things,\" according to a blog post on the new site. \"But it also contains something unexpected: a look under the hood at how we 'do' open source.\"\n\nThis means that Google is publishing documents that explain the tech company's release process for new projects, how it handles third-party open source projects it uses internally, and how to submit patches to other projects.\n\n\"Our policies and procedures are informed by many years of experience and lessons we've learned along the way,\" according to the blog. \"We know that our particular approach to open source might not be right for everyone--there's more than one way to do open source--and so these docs should not be read as a 'how-to' guide.\"", "Google today announced the release of its Calendar app for iPad, which was previously only available for iPhone, Android smartphones and tablets and on the web.\n\nThe iPad version of Calendar will be a familiar UI to anyone that has used the app for iPhone, and also borrows from some of the user interface elements Google has implemented with its tablet app for Android. Google notes, however, that the app has been specifically optimized for iPad, noting that you’ll be able to search from the iPad home screen using Spotlight Search with the app.\n\nWith the new app, you’ll get all the Calendar features you know and love, now optimized for iPad.

Today’s low-key relaunch marks the first time it has revived a service specifically for users in China.\n\nGoogle has maintained a web-based version of Translate that has been accessible since its China exit, but with half of China’s 1.4 billion population using the internet on mobile, according to the latest government figures, these apps will give the service wider reach. The iOS version of Translate is available in the Chinese App Store, while Google is directing Android users to a direct download from its servers here. Previously, those in China could only use the app when connected to a VPN to evade the government’s internet censorship system.\n\n“Google Translate has been available in China for more than eight years. Today, we’re making our Translate app work better for Chinese users,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.\n\nThe apps will be maintained by Google’s joint-venture in China, which runs the services it has remaining there, and will be subject to any government-issued requests or censorship, Google confirmed.\n\nGoogle added that users of the Chinese version have full access to the service, which includes Word Lens, the feature that translates text from photos snapped inside the app. Word Lens gained support Chinese last year and Chinese was the first language Google picked for its new machine learning translation technology, which went live last September and hugely advanced the way the service works.\n\n“With today’s update, we’re hoping to make the Translate experience better for Chinese users, helping break down language barriers by connecting people around the world,” Google wrote in a blog post.\n\nThe launch was applauded by GreatFire, a nonprofit group that tracks internet censorship in China and has helped the BBC, The New York Times and other media beat Chinese censors.\n\n“I am encouraged that Google is making the app available for direct download, in essence thwarting censorship of the Google Play store in China,” said Charlie Smith, the organization’s pseudonymous head.\n\n“I hope that Google will provide support and guidance to app developers who want to adopt similar tactics and I applaud Google for finally deploying an effective anti-censorship initiative in China,” Smith added.\n\nPublicly, at least, Google is saying that the launch of the Chinese version of the app is about giving more options to Chinese internet users, who also have services from Baidu and other Chinese companies available, but today’s news marks a notable advance on its China strategy.\n\nTranslate won’t generate revenue for Google, but it may boost its visibility among Chinese internet users. Potentially, it sets a precedent for introducing China-specific versions of other Google apps and services in the future, although the company declined to comment when we asked it about that directly.\n\nThen there’s also the possibility that this launch is a litmus test or precursor to the re-introduction of Google Play in China.\n\nReuters, The Information and other media have consistently reported over the past year that Google harbors ambitions to bring the Google Play Store to Chinese soil. Despite the rumblings, there’s been no concrete advance on this apparent objective. Even then, there’s no guarantee that any such move would be successful. China’s Android ecosystem is dominated by a number of third-party app stores, including 91 Wireless (acquired by Baidu for $1.9 billion in 2013), Alibaba-owned Wandoujia and offerings from Tencent and Xiaomi.\n\nChina’s colossal base of more than 730 million internet users has turned it into an important market for mobile. The country recently overtook the U.S. to become the world’s most lucrative market for iOS app developers, and it’s a market where Google has little footprint. The company connected China-based developers with its global app store footprint two years ago, but it’s no surprise that Google is reported to be exploring the possibilities inside China.\n\nFeatured Image: crystal51/Shutterstock", "(2 votes, average: 5.00 out of 5)\n\nvotes, average:out of 5) Loading... Loading... There Are No Winners in the Google/Symantec Feud\n\nSymantec Owes its Customers Better, But So Does Google.\n\nThe ongoing feud between Symantec and the browser community, specifically Google, is bad for the entire SSL industry. Its consequences will undoubtedly be felt across the internet, in ways both seen and unseen. And Symantec must step up to the plate and own a portion of the blame for even letting things get to the point where Google can threaten to remove trust in existing Symantec SSL certificates.\n\nBefore we get to that though, I want to level with you. We were split Friday about whether or not to discuss this proposal, made by Google’s Ryan Sleevi. On one hand, Hashed Out prides itself on being an industry leading news source. On the other, despite the fact that Hashed Out generally operates with a considerable degree of autonomy, The SSL Store™ is a very close partner with Symantec.\n\nWe offer and support all the Symantec family of brands, we are a seasoned upper-echelon platinum partner and have held a seat on Symantec’s Partner Advisory Council for a number of years. We’ve even purchased furniture together—you could say it’s a serious relationship.\n\nStill, in the interest of maintaining objectivity and addressing some of the questions and feedback that we are fielding from our customers, clients, resellers and the community we feel that we need to discuss this proposal.\n\nLet’s Start With the Proposal to Remove Trust in Existing Symantec SSL Certificates\n\nFor anyone who is not aware, on March 23rd, Ryan Sleevi, a Google Software Engineer, published a proposal that would gradually deprecate and remove trust in existing Symantec SSL certificates. The action proposed is:\n\nA reduction in the accepted validity period of newly issued Symantec-issued certificates to nine months or less, in order to minimize any impact to Google Chrome users from any further misissuances [sic] that may arise.\n\nAn incremental distrust, spanning a series of Google Chrome releases, of all currently-trusted Symantec-issued certificates, requiring they be revalidated and replaced.\n\nRemoval of recognition of the Extended Validation status of Symantec issued certificates, until such a time as the community can be assured in the policies and practices of Symantec, but no sooner than one year.\n\nTo clarify, this refers to all SSL certificates from the Symantec family of brands (GeoTrust, Thawte, RapidSSL and of course the Symantec brand).\n\nNow, the way we got here is complicated. It starts with Andrew Ayer, an independent researcher, posting about a handful of certificates that appeared to be mis-issued by Symantec. As all the parties involved (Symantec, Google, Mozilla, etc) started looking into the issue, an investigation revealed that there were some problems with Registration Authorities (RAs) that Symantec had partnered with. These RAs had a special partnership with Symantec where they were to handle certificate validation in certain overseas regions where they were more experienced in the language and the way business is done.\n\nHowever, Google claims that Symantec failed to comply with industry standards and could not provide audits showing the necessary documentation. Because these companies issued certificates in Symantec’s name (and from its root certificates), Google suggests that Symantec was culpable for their failures.\n\nGoogle seems to have taken issue with the fact that Symantec was unaware of these problems with its partners, and thinks that Symantec neglected to oversee their actions. This event, in combination with a similar compliance issue back in late 2015, has raised a few concerns for Google.\n\nAnd that ultimately led to the proposal by Sleevi to deprecate and remove trust from Symantec.\n\nOne last thing, (for the sake of this discussion) I am referring specifically to Google because it is the only browser that has of yet made a formal proposal. It’s also the most publicly visible. Mozilla is also discussing punitive action. Apple and Microsoft, though considerably less public in their deliberations, typically fall in line with Google and Mozilla.\n\nWhat Does This Mean?\n\nAs it currently stands, if this proposal is accepted, Symantec’s customers are going to be the ones that feel the brunt of the pain. This is going to be extremely disruptive on a lot of fronts, though Google has been very clear and concise about which party deserves the blame for that—and it’s not Google.\n\nFor Symantec customers, any existing SSL certificate that isn’t already set to expire in the next few months is going to need to be re-issued and re-installed. Additionally, if you paid for a validity period greater than nine months (which would apply to everyone), you may be out whatever money you paid for months ten and beyond. We envision Symantec will be able remedy this during the renewal process.\n\nAnd finally, they’re saying if a Symantec customer invested in premium Extended Validation SSL, you would be completely out of luck, Google’s punishment is that Symantec will be without EV privileges for at least a year. So, you would either be stuck with a very expensive DV certificate (because that’s essentially what the browsers will view it as) or you’re simply going to have to find a new Certificate Authority and go through the entire extended validation process once again and waste more money and more time.\n\nNow, Symantec has already rightfully stated that it will take the necessary measures to keep its customers from being negatively affected, but there’s only so much it can do that would be within its own control. While it can (and likely will) easily honor the original validity period that customers purchased by offering free renewals through the originally expected expiration date, it cannot replace the lost EV certificates – and perhaps just as importantly to the customer, the green address bar – nor can it save its customers the time and hassle that would be involved with re-installing all of these newly re-issued certificates.\n\nEven in the most generous of potential outcomes, a good portion of Symantec’s customer base would be impacted through no fault of its own.\n\nWhy This is Bad for the Industry\n\nLet’s start this portion of the discussion by acknowledging something that seems to hang over a lot of SSL-related debates that we frequently run into while actively participating in community discussions. There is an entire industry that has popped up around SSL/TLS. There are for-profit CAs, resellers, sub-resellers and a number of other parties that contribute to what has become a billion-dollar global industry.\n\nA lot of folks seem to have a problem with that, there is a subset of people involved in this discussion that doesn’t believe there should be a financial gatekeeper to encryption. As a result of that position, any business-minded input is typically viewed negatively—almost as if it has no place in the conversation.\n\nThat is a very myopic perspective. Perhaps, in an ideal world where we knew what the internet was to become, things would have evolved differently. In an ideal world, the developers and engineers that so bemoan the monetization of encryption-related products would have designed the internet to be secure in the first place, thus eliminating any potential for an industry to pop up around a technology like SSL.\n\nFrankly, we can all probably agree that may be a better alternative. But those ideals exist only in the imaginations of the passionate individuals that advocate for them. The reality of the situation is that the internet was not designed securely and by virtue of that there is a commercial SSL industry.\n\nAnd while that may seem like an abstraction to some – those that don’t deal directly with customers and end users – it doesn’t change that it’s the reality. All I am trying to say is that a software engineer at Google is certainly going to have a far different perspective on our industry than, let’s say, one of our own account managers who deals hands-on with a diverse set of client types and their direct real-life feedback on a daily basis.\n\nNeither are wrong, just very different.\n\nMy point is this: real people who have used this extremely popular commercial CA have their businesses, websites and financial livelihoods at stake here.\n\nAnd no, I’m not talking about the people at Symantec, which is a multi-billion dollar business operation that could literally leave the SSL industry entirely and still stay solvent. I’m talking about the countless others involved directly and indirectly in the SSL industry at any level who are going to really feel the pain.\n\nI’m talking about the IT services providers who are potentially going to have to drop everything and tend to thousands of support inquiries or rework deep integrations. The small business owner who bought a premium security solution and will never hear a peep about Symantec’s hardships, who just took a loss and has to scramble to find a replacement. The large enterprises where it takes six months for any new SSL to be fully adopted into their environment. The site owners that are going to have to figure out how to navigate something they know nothing about yet again. Heck, if we’re being funny, even dear old Aunt Edna, who was told to look for the EV indicator in the URL when accessing her bank account online to reduce her phishing risk, is now back to stuffing wads of dollar bills and piles of loose change inside her mattress because she’s now skeptical about online banking again.\n\nAll kidding aside though, I’m talking about potential dis-trust towards websites that should absolutely still be trusted to the fullest extent.\n\nWhile this may not necessarily put most companies and organizations out of business, this proposal will undoubtedly result in the loss of money and other precious resources, in addition to having a butterfly effect down to the average web user. Businesses don’t like losing money. They also don’t like wasting resources like time and man hours on projects that they have already properly addressed.\n\nWhich leads to the more salient point, this move could potentially damage the public’s faith in SSL and encryption at a very inopportune time. It’s no secret that the browsers are moving rapidly to mandate encryption. Funny enough, it began with the Google Chrome team itself back in 2014 when it announced that SSL is now a ranking signal in its algorithm. Recently, the shift to “secure”/”not secure” visual indicators is the most overt move yet in terms of pushing sites toward end-to-end encryption.\n\nAs a result, for many individual website owners, as well as an unfortunate number of businesses and organizations, this may be their first experience with SSL/TLS encryption. Symantec has historically enjoyed a reputation as one of the premier Certificate Authorities in the world. You can’t fault someone for choosing a Symantec product, especially considering that the majority of these customers aren’t keeping up with the CA/Browser Forum or following Google and Mozilla’s back-and-forth with Symantec.\n\nThat means for many people, their first experience with this newly required security solution (for which there is no real alternative) will be a negative one. They will have paid top dollar to purchase from a reputable brand and then that product will not only fail to deliver on their expectations, it may even end up causing them to lose money.\n\nAnd keep in mind, these aren’t software engineers and security experts, these are business professionals that probably aren’t going to bother to read long, highly technical descriptions of what happened and why these actions were justified, etc. They’re going to boil it down to its most basic level—as is common in business.\n\nThere are three ways they might look at this: first, they will undoubtedly blame Symantec.\n\nSecond, they’re going to blame Google. Despite its best effort, Google is not going to come out of this unscathed.\n\nAnd finally, those negatively affected by this proposal may reassess their opinion of SSL altogether. And we’re probably not going to like the conclusions they reach. Whether it’s starting to believe that SSL is some kind of racket, or it’s an inability to trust the technology moving forward—nothing about what’s being proposed is going to improve attitudes towards SSL.\n\nWhile to people who are fully informed, this is a very specific debate about validation practices, policies and accountability (which I totally get), to the average person it’s going to look like two mega-corporations, Google and Symantec, fighting about a product and totally screwing over a bunch of innocent people in the process.\n\nNobody wins in this situation. Everyone loses, it just varies to what degree.\n\nWhat Needs to Happen\n\nThe solution for this issue isn’t simple. On one hand, Symantec certainly needs to tighten some things up. To be fair, Google has given Symantec ample warning and opportunities to become compliant with its standards/expectations and Symantec apparently is yet to achieve that. Whether or not it’s fair that Google (and the other browsers) impose those requirements on Symantec is frankly irrelevant at this point, Symantec has a responsibility to its customers that should supersede that question.\n\nBut Google also needs to be more careful with the power it wields. In many ways, these actions seem less designed to force compliance and more designed to damage the business interests of Symantec. Nine months is an extremely irregular length of time for certificate validity and one could argue that this requirement places Symantec at an obvious competitive disadvantage. Additionally, by removing EV status for a year, Google is essentially cratering Symantec’s entire EV SSL operation. Most of Symantec’s existing EV customers will leave, and its credibility will be forever strained once the program comes back.\n\nGranted, this is really Symantec’s problem—not Google’s. But the optics are terrible all around. And any conspiracy-minded individual doesn’t have to stretch very far to cobble together a narrative.\n\nThe two companies need to come together – a feat that shouldn’t be difficult considering their headquarters are located across the street from one another – and discuss a solution that both forces Symantec to address the issues Google has raised head-on, while also minimizing the amount of undue hardship on other, under-represented members of the SSL industry. You know, those who use and depend on it for normal business operation in real life. This is not the time for posturing, or for an unyielding adherence to policy, nor is it the time debate two contrasting philosophies on SSL—this is the time for pragmatism.\n\nThis debate isn’t occurring in a vacuum. There are real consequences and real collateral at stake here—it’s not an exaggeration to say this will affect peoples’ livelihood. Maybe Symantec doesn’t deserve the benefit of the doubt from Google, but Symantec’s customers sure do. Now is the time to find a solution that remediates Symantec’s issues while also preventing undue hardship on literally tens of thousands of individuals, companies, and organizations.\n\nBecause their voice is ours—and the implications of this proposal are far too wide-reaching for it to be ignored.", "Ian Morris\n\nI've said it loads and got a load of hassle for it, but the Google Pixel camera shouldn't be as good as it is. The fact is, however, that Google absolutely nailed the crucial part of the camera in that phone - the software. Now Samsung is bursting on the scene with an improved camera that should, all being well, smash the record set by Google.\n\nFirstly, the hardware is excellent. It's got the same 12-megapixel sensor and the same f/1.7 lens as the S7. This gives is a basic advantage of the slightly worse lens in the Google Pixel, which is f/2.0. This difference sounds small but it's all about the light that gets to the sensor. More light means less noise, and a much sharper and cleaner image.\n\nSamsung's next trick is to use the same technique that Google does. This isn't a hardware feature, but one that works in software. To do this, the S8 and S8+ each take three photographs in quick succession when you press the shutter button. This is done far quicker than, say, a burst frame. But it's crucial to get good low-noise images in low light.\n\nBut Google's Pixel is an excellent camera phone. So good in fact that it's been crowned the best available. So how? Well, Google uses a photographic technique that takes several photos in a row, as quickly as possible, to give three distinct images that have minimal movement in them, but allow the removal of noise through processing.\n\nThis system allows Google to \"see\" noise in an image because sensor noise is random in nature and changes with each capture. Taking three shows in a row means that the noise can be subtracted from the final image to give a clean output. Look at any photo from a Pixel online, especially in low light, and you'll see just how good this technique is.\n\nSo there you have it, Samsung will offer slightly better hardware on the S8 and S8+ than the Google Pixel does, plus it will be using the key Google software trick. Now we'll need to see photo samples before we can really talk about how well Samsung has achieved its goal, but the company has recently managed some excellent work with photos and is a close rival for Apple in the image stakes.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @IanMorris78 or Google+ and read all of my Forbes articles on my profile page. I also regularly appear on the Tech's Message Podcast which you can find on ACast.", "[Finally] Google Home now Defers to Google Assistant for Reminders, Calls, Texts and More\n\nThe Google Home has been one of my favorite purchases in recent memory. When support for third-party integrations was announced, I was excited for the possibilities it would bring for power users like myself. While I’ve been busy tinkering away with getting my own custom voice commands, many regular users of the Google Home have felt frustrated that the home assistant service is unable to perform some fairly basic tasks such as making phone calls, sending text messages, or creating reminders.\n\nWhat rubs further salt on these wounds is the fact that these basic features are available in the regular Google Assistant that’s (now) present on most Android 6.0+ devices. It would be great if you could continue using these features on your smartphone even though they’re inaccessible on the Google Home, but yet another frustrating feature of the Google Home is that it hijacked every “OK Google” voice command that you initiate when you’re in range. Until now.\n\nOn my Google Home, at least, I’ve noticed that the Google Home will now no longer answer questions that it doesn’t support, and instead defer to the Google Assistant on my phone. If I ask it a question like “what is the weather right now” my Google Home will answer, but if I ask it to make a phone call, send a text message, set a reminder, or ask if to do any other command it can’t handle (but Assistant can), Google Assistant on my phone will now handle that command.\n\nI am not sure if this feature has rolled out to all Google Home users, but this is certainly a very welcome change. My Google Home is in my bedroom, so when I ask my Google Home to do something chances are my phone is also in range to hear my “OK Google” prompt. Thanks to this change, I now no longer have to worry that I my Google Home triggered alongside Assistant before asking it to make a phone call, text somebody, or add a reminder.", "“Google is arguably the best risk/reward in large cap internet, with ~20 percent revenue & EPS CAGRs for the next few years & a 2018e 20x GAAP EPS multiple.”\n\nThat's what Barclays’ Ross Sandler said in a note, initiating coverage of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) with an Overweight rating and price target of $1,065.\n\nBull Case\n\nThe analyst mentioned that the pace of innovation at the company was high, especially since Alphabet updated many of its core applications using its advanced machine learning (AI), while expanding into areas like Cloud and Hardware.\n\n“There is ample room for mobile advertising to keep taking share from other channels, and Google should capture its consistent ~50 percent of every incremental dollar going forward across both YouTube & Search,” Sandler said.\n\nThe analyst doesn't expect Alphabet’s core operating margin to expand, since the revenue mix is skewed to lower margin areas growing more rapidly than ads, although “Other Bets” could reduce their loss, which would then drive upside to the consensus EPS expectations.\n\n“Google may also benefit from cash repatriation, further supporting shares in 2017/18,” Sandler stated.\n\nRelated Link: Google Downgraded On European Ad Concerns\n\nBear Case\n\nOn the other hand, the analyst pointed out that Alphabet was a maturing company that “had its hey-day in desktop and to a lesser degree in mobile. Its centrality to the space going forward is strong but clearly less dominant.”\n\nIn addition, the company is in the process of transitioning from “search-primarily” revenue to other areas, which entail materially lower margins and where the company doesn't have a strong competitive advantage.\n\nSandler also noted “2016 was a year that benefitted from considerable monetization improvements in mobile search, and we think growth could decelerate from here.”\n\nHowever, the analyst expects the stock to continue its gradual appreciation, as it had done through 2016.\n\nLatest Ratings for GOOGL Date Firm Action From To Mar 2017 Barclays Initiates Coverage On Overweight Mar 2017 Nomura Maintains Buy Mar 2017 Pivotal Research Downgrades Buy Hold View More Analyst Ratings for GOOGL\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nPosted-In: Barclays Ross SandlerAnalyst Color Long Ideas Price Target Initiation Analyst Ratings Trading Ideas Best of Benzinga\n\n© 2017 Benzinga.com.

However, a new report indicates that various phone makers, HTC included, are already fighting for orders of the Google Pixel 3 series of phones that will be launched in 2018.\n\nDon't Miss : Never worry about protecting your Pixel XL screen again\n\nThe news comes from Asia, where Chinese-language Commercial Times reported that HTC, LG, TCL, and Coolpad are competing for next-gen Pixel orders, according to Digitimes.\n\nLG appears to be the likely winner for Pixel 3 orders, the report said, with orders expected to reach five million units next year.\n\nThe same report notes that the Pixel 2 family of products, due in 2017, will be made by HTC. Google a few weeks ago confirmed that a Pixel 2 generation is in the making, and it’s supposed to launch in fall. The phones will continue to be premium devices, as Google is determined to compete against Apple, Samsung, and others in this particular market segment.\n\nHTC already shipped more than 2.1 million Pixel and Pixel XL devices since last September, the report notes. Google had a tough time meeting demand for the Pixel, a widely appreciated device by fans, and things aren’t getting any better.\n\nHTC will make two versions of the Pixel 2, with the Chinese paper confirming the Muskie and Walleye codenames that leaked a few weeks ago directly from Google’s forums.

But barely seven weeks later, it has risen from relative anonymity to the very top of the marketing totem pole for almost every major brand on the planet.\n\nLike me, you were probably vaguely aware of the original article in The Times that claimed ‘Big brands fund terror through online adverts’ and the subsequent response, particularly of Jaguar Land Rover, which was the first major advertiser to pull all their digital advertising in the UK as a result of brand safety concerns. But things quietened down and the issue appeared to fade from the marketing agenda.\n\nREAD MORE: Google under fire as brands pull advertising and ad industry demands action\n\nThen, less than two weeks ago, we were confronted with a growing array of bizarrely juxtaposed advertising relationships. It’s hard to know which media placement made the least sense. Was it the idea that Marie Curie was funding and appearing alongside a Neo-Nazi group? Maybe it was the Guardian’s online membership drive being featured on a video for bearded jihadi warriors. Or perhaps it was an ad for Scottish tourism appearing alongside videos for white supremacy. Time and again the most unimpeachable, familiar brands suddenly became associated with unmentionable hate groups.\n\nA digital world detached from reality\n\nBut what has proven more disarming is the response from most of the marketing community and the fallout from the current brand safety crisis. Increasingly, living in a special digital world detached from consumer reality and unaccustomed to any form of critical assessment, many digital marketers took to social media to point out that this was as much the fault of advertisers as it was the poor unfortunates at Google.\n\nDaniel Gilbert, the CEO of Brainlabs, typified the response with an article for Campaign that opened with: “The recent blame game where Google is the ‘big baddie’ is pure deflection in an attempt to hide the real truth – that media agencies and advertisers don’t understand how to run effective ad campaigns on Google’s platform”.\n\nWayne Blodwell – the CEO of The Programmatic Advisory – was equally dismissive of Google’s culpability. “Advertisers should stop pointing all of the blame at YouTube and become more accountable,” he concluded.\n\nBlaming the customer for brand safety issues isn’t just stupid, it runs directly against one of the core tenets of marketing. While it’s fair to point out that many of the clients affected were clearly hunting for the lowest possible CPM and therefore not on top of their game, it’s unfair to suggest that this somehow justified their advertising appearing in such intolerable media contexts and funding such abhorrent organisations.\n\nOther, equally dismissive responses to the brand safety scandal acknowledged that the issue was a problem but queried whether it was anything other than a tiny, negligible issue for advertisers. Google EMEA boss Matt Brittin initially tried this line of argument at the Advertising Week Europe conference in London 10 days ago.\n\nBrittin apologised for the brand safety issues that Google had created but then observed: “In general I’ve found that it has been a handful of impressions and pennies not pounds.”\n\nIt was a line repeated by several other marketers last week with various estimates reducing the proportion of unsafe material to fractions of a decimal point. That jars significantly with independent analysis by Integral Ad Science (IAS), which estimates that around 8% of all digital display advertising and 11% of digital video had the potential for brand risk in H1 2016.\n\nThat risk (as shown above) is variously made up of content associated with pornography, hate speech, violence and illegal drug consumption. If you listen to the Google apologists the odds of an adverse incident of brand risk appear about the same as a lightning strike. If you believe the IAS report it is more akin to Russian Roulette, and you play the game every time your ad is served. Probably somewhere between these two extremes lies the true proportion, but that’s enough risk to keep even the most cock-sure brand manager awake at night.\n\nOther responses to the brand safety saga pointed to a dark conspiracy by traditional media outlets, and particularly the news media, to exaggerate the crisis in a nefarious attempt to damage Google’s advertising credentials and rescue their own flagging revenues. With headlines like the Daily Mail’s ‘Google – The Terrorist’s Friend’, it was clear many tabloid newspapers were going in egregiously hard last week.\n\nHow big an issue is brand safety?\n\nIt’s a matter of perspective whether this negative coverage was an explicit attempt by the news media to undermine their now dominant digital rivals or the stirring of sleeping giants that have sat on their respective hands for too long and allowed digital media to play fast and loose with the truth at their own commercial expense.\n\nWhichever it is, Google had become accustomed to winning massive market share with barely a whimper from its media rivals. This sudden eruption of hostilities, the vehemence of the attacks and the apparent damage done to both its revenue stream and share price must have taken the search giant by surprise. One of the few disadvantages of being part of a duopoly is that your competitive zeal and ability to fight back gradually dull. Perhaps we saw some of that duopolistic lethargy on display last week as various Google executives appeared genuinely bemused at the crisis that unfolded around them.\n\nBrand safety is not an excuse to beat up Google or a tiny issue exaggerated by media rivals; it’s a massively unacceptable contradiction to corporate social responsibility and the whole notion of purpose-led brand management.\n\nDespite the naysayers, this is clearly not a crisis created by traditional media or one that has been exaggerated to enable clients to get better terms from Google. Cynics might question the veracity of brand safety but the issue is a genuine one and not a gambit being used to restore balance to the media playing field. Advertisers really are paranoid about this kind of stuff. To understand why, indulge me with a story from my dim and distant past.\n\nI once worked with the partner responsible for marketing at a large consulting firm. We had flown to Miami for a training programme and as we walked through the airport he spied a homeless man carrying his possessions around in a large paper bag. Without hesitation, the consultant strode purposefully across the airport and offered the man a crisp $20 note.\n\nAn exchange took place and seconds later the homeless man was on his way with a broad, toothless smile plastered across his face and his possessions under his arm. The consultant was back at my side clutching the paper bag which, I realised, bore the name of his firm in bold blue letters across both sides. Far from a sudden injection of humanity or pathos, the consultant had been appalled at the damage that this branded bag might have on his firm’s reputation and acted accordingly.\n\nAt the time, I found the exchange bizarre and curiously distasteful. But it’s an accurate reflection of how most advertisers, especially those in direct control of a brand, feel about any inconsistencies or contradictions in their brand’s public presentation. If marketers are content to spend millions to protect the reputation of their brands and promote their social responsibilities to all and sundry they are also, by the same logic, likely to go to equally extreme lengths to avoid any inappropriate associations or connections in the way their brand appears.\n\nBrand safety is not an excuse to beat up Google or a tiny issue that has been exaggerated by media rivals; it’s a massively unacceptable contradiction to corporate social responsibility and the whole notion of purpose-led brand management. The fact that the media will now shine a light on any and all incidences of brand safety certainly exacerbates the issue, but it did not create the crisis in the first place.\n\nWhat this tells us about advertising in 2017\n\nIgnoring the excuses then, what does the brand safety saga tell us about advertising in 2017? First, it confirms the fact that despite the shiny golden promises of programmatic it really does represent a black box of turds and spiders for many clients.\n\nDespite repeated claims from independent sources that as much as 70% of all money invested in programmatic is going to various ticket punching agency commissions and not to media platforms. Despite estimates that put the proportion of bots being served ads in programmatic somewhere between 3% and 37%. Despite clearly not having a fucking clue where their advertising is going or who their marketing budgets are funding via programmatic media buying. Advertisers continue to invest more and more into programmatic in this country. The £2.7bn invested through programmatic in 2016 represented an increase of 44% over the previous year.\n\nSecondly, it provides further evidence, if any were needed, that advertisers at even the biggest brands don’t actually know what their media money is doing. Things have become too complex, too fluid and too multi-dimensional for even the biggest brand managers to control.\n\nThis was apparent from the ANA report last year in which clients were portrayed as naïve, almost child-like figures who were wholly unaware of the “pervasive” transparency issues that surrounded them at any turn. It also emerged from the disarming honesty of Marc Pritchard, the chief brand officer at Procter & Gamble. He openly admitted that his agency had received rebated media as a result of making media purchases on his behalf but without his approval or awareness. And when he challenged his agency he was also unaware that the contract he had signed with them sanctioned such activity.\n\nREAD MORE: P&G’s Marc Pritchard has made the biggest marketing speech for 20 years\n\nThat same lack of knowledge and control was embarrassingly evident in the proud claims of L’Oréal UK CMO Hugh Pile. He claimed to be “very clear on where our media money was going” in an interview in The Drum on 7 March. But a week later the company was “horrified” and “unaware” that its latest campaign featuring Dame Helen Mirren and the Prince’s Trust featured alongside the message that gay people “were not born that way, but they will burn that way” from hate preacher Steven Anderson.\n\nIf the likes of P&G and L’Oréal are finding themselves out of step and out of their depth in the brave new world of digital media and programmatic, imagine the situation further down the big brand pecking order.\n\n\n\nThe brochures of the brave new world of digital media proclaim real-time efficiencies, artificial intelligence and the ability to engage with consumers globally. But the reality that is emerging from the transparency issue, programmatic murkiness and the growing spectre of brand risk is about as far from this idealistic panacea as its possible to imagine.\n\nDigital marketers might contend that these are understandable issues for a new industry barely a decade in the making. But with 58% of UK advertising spend now devoted to digital media it seems a little late to be putting everything down to growing pains.", "", "Technology has the potential to be a game changer for teachers in far-flung places and schools with few resources.

The UK release date of Google Home is now known to be 6 April 2017, when it will launch alongside Google Wifi.\n\nBut what exactly is Google Home? It's is a voice-activated speaker which lets you have a conversation with the Google Assistant.\n\nIt can answer questions, control your smart home kit, play music and take notes and reminders.\n\nSo, on the surface, pretty much exactly the same at the Amazon Echo. But if you're a Google user, there's a lot more you can do with the Home.\n\nAlso read our Google Home preview\n\nWhen is the Google Home UK release date?\n\nGoogle Home is already available in the US, where you can buy a Google Home for $129. In the UK Google Home will go on sale on 6 April 2017.\n\nDon't be tempted to import a Google Home as some of the services won't work in the UK and the warranty will be void, too. (Google has made the latter part very clear.)\n\nPlus, you'd need a UK adaptor in order to be able to power it, and while you'll be able to control music playback and it will work with your Chromecast.\n\nYou can also ask the assistant the usual questions, you won't find an UK-specific services, nor an UK news briefings (outside of BBC World Service).\n\nFor the sake of a few weeks, it's worth waiting for the official UK version.\n\nHow much will Google Home cost in the UK?\n\nGoogle Home will cost £129 in the UK, which is the same price as Google Wifi. Coloured bases will cost £18 for fabric and £36 for metal.\n\nIt will be available direct from the Google Store, as well as Argos, Currys, John Lewis and Maplin, and will be coming soon to EE.\n\nWhat is the Google Assistant?\n\nGoogle Assistant is the new conversational 'bot' that was announced at Google I/O 2016. It's an extension of Google Now but, a bit like Siri, allows better two-way conversations.\n\nGoogle says this is due to advances in AI and machine learning, giving the all-important context to conversations.\n\nOne example given was booking cinema tickets. You could say to the assistant, \"What's playing tonight?\" and it would understand you want to know which films are showing at your local cinema.\n\nAfter displaying a few titles, you could say \"We're planning on bringing the kids\" at which point the assistant shows family-friendly films.\n\nYou could then say \"Ok, let's see Jungle Book\", and the assistant could purchase four tickets and display a QR code you can show at the door. But the conversation could have \"gone many different ways\", said Pichai.\n\nWe discussed the Google event right after it happened on our podcast. Listen here:\n\nInstead of choosing a film from the selection, you could say \"Is Jungle Book any good\" and the assistant would check reviews, display ratings from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes, and offer up the trailer to watch.\n\nThe Google Assistant isn't limited to Google Home of course. It first appeared on Google's Pixel phones, but is now beginning to roll out on other Android phones.\n\nGoogle's Rick Osterloh reckons that Home will best Amazon's Alexa assistant because Google has a richer history of people making voice queries through its browser and Android phones.\n\nThis means that the Google Assistant is better placed to \"really understand what people are asking for\" than Alexa, which relies on Microsoft's Bing search engine and Wikipedia to answer a lot of questions.\n\nAlso, a report by Android Police says that Google is probably working on making Home able to recognise users' voices. This will overcome the current limitation of being signed into only one Google account, which is fine if you live alone, but not so useful in a family home or shared household where the assistant's answers are based on someone else's Google profile.\n\nIf Home can indeed recognise a voice and switch to that person's account on the fly, they will be able to find out what meetings they have that day and whether there are delays on their commute.\n\nCurrently, both Home and Amazon's Alexa can do those things, but only for one account. (You can manually change accounts using the apps, but this is a hassle no-one wants.)\n\nAmazon may have a much bigger library of 'skills', which will help the Echo and other Alexa-enabled devices to remain popular, but unless it can improve Alexa's ability to answer questions rather than simply respond to commands, sales may suffer against Google Home.\n\nGoogle Home features\n\nThe small device has interchangeable bases, in various colours, metal and fabric finishes, allowing you to tailor it to your décor, making it ideal for different environments around the house.\n\nUnder the interchangeable grill there is a speaker. There are three speakers to be precise, one low-end driver and two 'dual-passive' drivers aimed to deliver a complete frequency range.\n\nWe have yet to hear it in a home (having only seen it at demos) so can't comment on these claims, but the speakers will play your favourite songs and allow the assistant to talk to you. Also see: Best Bluetooth speakers.\n\nThe device itself is smaller than you might think: you can see the scale in the photo below. This means Google Home should be discrete in pretty much any room.\n\nAt the top of the device, there's a 'display' which has four small LEDs which allow you to interact with the device. It doesn't have any buttons on top but uses dual microphones to listen for your voice.\n\nThe device has a single button located on its shell, allowing you to mute the microphone - useful for times when you don't want it responding. Unfortunately, it doesn't have an SD card/microSD card slot or a USB port - so you won't be able to plug and play your own music through a physical device.\n\nYou can set alarms, set timers, alarms, create shopping lists, and Home will also support other smart home devices such as the Nest thermostat (owned by Google), lights and other connected devices.\n\nWe're excited to see the possibilities in the future, with Google wanting to open the device to other manufacturers and allow you to even order flowers or hire a car straight from your Google Home.\n\nMutliple Google Homes can be placed around the house so you can use it wherever you are. As well as working when you're close to the device and there's little ambient noise, Google has also worked hard to ensure excellent far-field voice recognition, which means it will work just as well if you say \"Ok Google, reserve a table at Pizza Express for four at 8pm tonight\" from across the room while the TV's on.\n\nYou don't always have to start the conversation. Home can playing an alert tone, and you can respond with \"Ok Google, I'm listening\". Home will then read out the alert such as, \"Your flight is delayed by 30 minutes\" and also give a short traffic report. On the back of that, you could ask the assistant to change your dinner reservation.\n\nIn February, Google Home owners in the US got the ability to order products in much the same way you can on an Amazon Echo. It uses the Google Express service and allows you to get products delivered to your home the same day - as long as you live in one of the 12 supported states.\n\nThere's a minimum order value, and delivery fees apply in addition to the annual membership fee for Google Express, but if you're willing to stump up you can now say to the Google Assistant, \"OK Google, order Duracell AA batteries\".\n\nAs it's a new service, there's a free three-month trial with free delivery in order to entice people to try it out.\n\nGoogle Home UK poll", "Google wants America to run on Dunkin’ and Waze.\n\nDunkin’ Donuts announced the rollout of a mobile order-ahead service in Google’s popular Waze navigation app on Wednesday, hoping to take advantage of commuters’ morning coffee routines. The Dunkin’ feature is likely the first of many order-ahead integrations for Waze as the traffic app seeks to increase revenue and leverage its big user base.\n\nUsing Waze, which Google acquired in 2013, drivers can order items from Dunkin’ Donuts and pick them up along their route. Although it’s the first time the traffic navigation app has incorporated an order-ahead feature, Waze has been supporting ads for nearby businesses (including Dunkin) for years.\n\nRather than paying for the order-ahead feature outright, Dunkin’ Donuts agreed to increase its advertising spend with Waze, according to The Chicago Tribune.\n\nThe feature is only available to members of Dunkin’ Donuts loyalty program who have the latest version of the Dunkin’ app installed. The actual ordering takes place in the Waze app. Customers who use mobile ordering can skip the line when they pick up their items.\n\nDunkin’ Donuts already offers order-ahead through its app but the Waze integration offers another option for customers. Mobile ordering was popularized by another coffee giant, Seattle-based Starbucks. The Mobile Order & Pay feature has become so popular that it’s clogging pick-up areas at Starbucks and forcing the company to consider revamping store layouts.", "Google Hopes To Hire More Black Engineers By Bringing Students To Silicon Valley\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Howard University Howard University\n\nIt's clear from the numbers. Google has a diversity problem.\n\nFor the past few years, the company has publicly shared its workplace makeup in a report detailing the race, gender and ethnicity of each employee hired the previous year. Last year, while the number of black employees went up, they still represented only 2 percent of the company's workforce and Google admitted it fell short of its diversity goal.\n\nIn one small step to grow those numbers, this summer 25 students from Howard University, the historically black university based in Washington, D.C., will train at the tech giant's headquarters in Mountain View, Caif.\n\nWith Howard West, as it's being called, Google believes it can meet that goal faster, says Bonita Stewart, the company's vice president of global partnerships.\n\n\"We have the opportunity to be able to build a qualified pipeline of talent across the black community,\" she says.\n\nThe pipeline, or the pipeline problem, is an idea commonly held in Silicon Valley that there just aren't enough blacks, Latinos and women with computer programming skills to fill jobs.\n\nThe 25 students at Howard West will be mentored by Google engineers and get regular classroom instruction from Howard professors.\n\nHoward and Google plan to train 750 students over five years and will open the program to students from all historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. Wayne A.I. Frederick, Howard's president, says this is an important step, \"but I think just as important, will be exposure to the culture here.\"\n\nFrederick heard from alums working in the industry, who said they felt Howard prepared them technically, but not culturally, to work in Silicon Valley. There's the management style, which values collaboration over hierarchy, the importance of networking and, of course, how to dress.\n\n\"So, for instance, I'm dressed in a suit and tie, and I haven't seen anybody else in a suit and a tie,\" he says, jokingly. \"So that's one example to just being exposed to that culture.\"\n\nChristian Simamora, of Code2040, a nonprofit dedicated to increasing the number of blacks and Latinos in the tech sector, applauds the opening of Howard West. He's concerned, though, that the narrative will become, \"there's a pipeline problem,\" he says.\n\n\"We would hire more black engineers if we could find them,\" Simamora says, mimicking a common refrain from tech companies. \"The fact of the matter is the talent is there.\"\n\nSimamora points out that about 18 percent of computer science majors in the U.S. identify as black or Latino, but they represent only 5 percent of the technology workforce. He says the problem is with recruitment.\n\n\"Many of the top tech companies aren't even recruiting at the HBCUs — Howard, Spelman. All these schools have CS programs.\"\n\nSo why aren't big tech companies recruiting at HBCUs?\n\n\"I can't speak for those companies,\" he says. \"But what I find interesting is that tech disrupts; tech hiring does not disrupt. It does not question what came before it.\"\n\nSimamora says many tech companies continue to focus their recruitment efforts at a few schools, like Stanford, Harvard and MIT - the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Considering that, Simamora says the opening of Howard West at Google is disruptive and might force the tech industry to start acting differently.", "Selling ads against user-generated content was always a risky proposition, in which Google and its advertisers indulged with their eyes open on Google’s YouTube platform.\n\nNow this predictable challenge has produced an alleged crisis for the internet, as businesses as diverse as Hyundai, McDonald’s and L’Oréal march off in a huff and say they can no longer advertise on YouTube.

Google said in a blog post that it has put in place more controls for advertisers, and it is also taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content.\n\nAlso: YouTube on defensive after new restrictions on some LGBTQ content\n\nThe potential impact of the increased scrutiny of ads and the backlash on YouTube, which is estimated to be about 15% to 20% of Alphabet’s GOOGL, +1.10% GOOG, +1.28% total revenue, is small when compared with the search giant’s total revenue, but not insubstantial. Analysts’ estimates on the drop in advertising spend range from about $750 million to about $1 billion in 2017.\n\n“We estimate a [negative 1%] impact this year and next, assuming the problem is settled soon,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nGoogle does not break out YouTube from Google’s other businesses, even though YouTube’s revenue is believed to rival that of Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.90% and bring in as much as four times the revenue of Twitter Inc. TWTR, +0.67% . In 2017, according to J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth’s estimate, YouTube will represent roughly $10.5 billion in total revenue, or about 12% of Google’s gross ad revenue; Nomura Instinet analyst Anthony DiClemente lowered his 2017 revenue estimate for YouTube to $9.49 billion from $10.24 billion because of the ad-placement controversy.\n\nMany analysts were quick to point out, though, that YouTube’s profit performance is a drop in the bucket as compared with that of the company, “perhaps no more than a few percent of total earnings,” Anmuth wrote Monday.\n\nYouTube's viewership set to overtake TV’s (1:46) YouTube viewers world-wide are now watching more than 1 billion hours of videos a day, boosted by algorithms personalizing user lineups. The number represents a ten-fold increase from 2012. Photo: Getty Images\n\nThe very large, name-brand advertisers that have promised to drop YouTube ads could also be trying to negotiate better rates “during a time when advertisers and agencies are looking for negotiating leverage against an increasingly duopolistic digital ad community” dominated by Google and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.63% , UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote.\n\nThe names of advertisers that have pulled ads since the brouhaha started with an investigation by the Times of London is long, at about 250 companies, ranging from Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -0.34% to L’Oréal SA OR, +0.62% to the Coca-Cola Co. KO, -0.02% . The Financial Times reported that advertisers are asking for discounts in pricing as a result.\n\nThe bigger fear for investors is that an advertiser backlash could spread from YouTube to Google’s overall search business, or cast a pall over YouTube’s planned “skinny bundle” service. Since the story broke, Alphabet shares have fallen nearly 4%.\n\nGoogle’s efforts to handle the situation are getting mixed reviews from investors who see cause for concern.\n\n“Their public statements do not suggest to us that the company appreciates the degree to which advertisers are concerned and the continuing announcements of advertisers suspending their activity on Google properties reinforces our view,” Pivotal analyst Wieser wrote.\n\nTrip Chowdhry, an analyst with Global Equities Research, predicted that Google will need to give out ad credits to lure back advertisers, which would also impact YouTube revenue.\n\nDon’t miss: This is what happens on the internet in just one minute\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the YouTube service was still rife with examples of ads running alongside offensive videos. Because the ads are automated, meaning they are placed using algorithms without human intervention, the advertisers also appear to need to be more involved in placing the ads themselves. Google said it is “changing the default settings for ads so that they show on content that meets a higher level of brand safety and exchanges potentially objectionable content.”\n\nGoogle has managed to handle such controversies in the past, and, alongside Facebook FB, +0.63% , has a dominant position in the online advertising industry. Investors who want to feel secure in that knowledge certainly have reason.\n\n“Don’t panic yet,” wrote Robert W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian, in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nPanic is unnecessary, but investors will want to carry this knowledge with them into the next few Alphabet earnings reports. While Google will likely continue to mask YouTube’s true performance from its investors, any slippage in the growth rate of advertising revenue should be cause for alarm.\n\nAlphabet shares have gained 6% so far in 2017, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.11% has gained 4.6%.", "Over the years, Google has not only implemented numerous pieces open source software in its own products and services, but also contributed several tools for people to use in their own projects.\n\nThat includes things like a JPEG encoder which can reduce file sizes by 35 percent, beautiful usable fonts including Roboto and Noto, and Bazel for testing software builds.\n\n“This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us.

We'd appreciate your feedback. Share your thoughts here.", "Share on twitter Tony Boyd by Some of the world's largest fund managers attending an investment conference in Hong Kong have been confronted with the harsh reality of what machine learning and artificial intelligence will mean for their jobs. The grim message was that at some time in the not too distant future someone searching on Google for a fund manager would more than likely be directed to Google's own machine-driven funds management arm. After waking up to the news that Blackrock, the world's biggest funds manager, was slashing its active management of equities in favour of algorithms, the fund managers were told by an industry expert, Jonathan Wilmot, that every aspect of their industry would come under attack from machines that could learn from their mistakes. Mr Wilmot was speaking at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference which is being attended by about 2500 institutional investors, hedge funds and wealthy investors.\n\nAbout half the fund managers attending the conference have more than $US5 billion ($6.5 billion) in funds under management. About a quarter have less than $US500 million under management and 20 per cent have between $US1 billion and $US5 billion.\n\nMr Wilmot is the founder of London-based WilmotML and former head of macro investment strategies at Credit Suisse. His firm combines machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques with a long-established macro framework to forecast the global economy. He believes that a new powerful funds management machine will likely emerge from DeepMind, the artificial intelligence company in London bought by Google in 2014. DeepMind was founded by Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman in 2010. \"Officially Google and DeepMind are not working on investment,\" Mr Wilmot said. \"I am not sure how many of you believe that. I don't. \"These are the guys that potentially have the highest credibility and the biggest capacity and the deepest pockets to apply machine learning techniques to fund management.\n\n\"And they have a lot of cash that they want to manage in this low return world. And they are mean, they don't like paying people fees.\" Later, in response to a question from The Australian Financial Review, Mr Wilmot said that companies with exclusive access to proprietary data, such as Google, would have an advantage over others in funds management using machine learning and data science. \"People like Google have enough money to buy all the financial data sets and they have all these other unstructured data sets that they could potentially mine and look at to use these techniques,\" he said. \"Who has access to the data and what kind of data it is and how relevant it is in the decision-making process is going to be the battlefield rather than having enough cloud computing space.\"\n\nBiggest barrier Mr Wilmot said that the biggest barrier to machines disrupting funds management was lack of transparency about what is \"under the hood\". He said some of the machine learning methods, including deep learning algorithms, were opaque. \"Deep learning is the ultra black box,\" he said. This would create issues of trust for investors.\n\nNevertheless, he predicted that machines would be used to screen and filter information for discretionary managers, to pick stocks, to decide asset allocation and to provide market timing indicators for discretionary managers. \"We have clearly got a whole set of techniques that are potentially incredibly powerful,\" he said. \"This is something the world has never seen before. Asset management is a complex task. \"The thing we know about these machines is that they are beyond human in their ability to process large data sets. \"We also know they don't have the context, the intuition, the judgement that human beings do and they don't have perhaps the adaptability that humans do.", "Google Keep can already autocomplete items in a grocery list saving you lots of time from typing things repeatedly, but it turns out that it can also autocomplete movie and TV show titles. We're not sure when exactly the option became available, it may have been there for months or it might be recent. Either way, it's there now, so consider this post a PSA for those of you who hadn't seen it before.\n\nIn order for Keep to start suggesting movies or TV shows for you, your list has to have something like \"movies\" in the title for the former, or \"TV shows\" for the latter. Then when you start typing, a pop-up shows with a neat icon and a couple of suggestions for you to choose from.\n\nNot all logical Keep note titles seem to trigger this behavior though. Based on my tests, it works with \"movies,\" \"film,\" and \"films,\" but oddly not \"movie.\" It also works with \"TV shows,\" but not \"TV series,\" or \"TV show.\" I also tried different permutations to see if it autocompleted books or songs or albums, but that didn't do anything. Google hasn't yet announced this feature officially, so it's probably still a work in progress.", "There's been a lot of attention focused over the past year on the rise of so-called \"fake news,\" a term that has even made its way into tweets by President Trump. But the problem has proven to be difficult to define, let alone solve.\n\nWhat exactly qualifies as \"fake news?\" A story about secret child sexual abuse rings operating underneath a pizza parlor? A Breitbart News item that suggests billionaire George Soros pays anti-Trump protesters? Or a New York Times report that says something the president doesn't want people to believe? All of these have been defined as fake news.\n\nAfter initially dismissing the suggestion that it plays a role in the spread of hoaxes and inaccurate information, Facebook has implemented a number of features designed to address the issue, including flagging stories as unverified.\n\nBut will this actually correct the overall problem? Social media researcher danah boyd (who chooses to spell her name using only lowercase letters) argues in a recent essay that it won't. And the reasons for that have a lot less to do with Facebook and a lot more to do with human nature.\n\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter.\n\nFor one thing, boyd says , no one—not even experts in the area—can agree on a definition of what \"fake news\" is. The term is used to refer to every conceivable kind of problematic content, \"including both blatantly and accidentally inaccurate information, salacious and fear-mongering headlines, hateful and incendiary rhetoric produced in blogs, and propaganda of all stripes.\"\n\nThe worst kinds of false news aren't even the most obvious kinds—the clear fakes or ridiculous assertions—the Microsoft researcher and former fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center says:\n\nMuch of the most insidious content out there isn’t in your face. It’s not spread widely, and certainly not by people who are forwarding it to object. It’s subtle content that is factually accurate, biased in presentation and framing, and encouraging folks to make dangerous conclusions that are not explicitly spelled out in the content itself.\n\nThere are definitely some \"low-hanging fruit mechanisms\" that platforms like Facebook and Google can use, boyd says, including cutting off the economic incentive for fake news by blocking certain sites from ad networks. But at the end of the day, she writes, \"these are rounding errors in the ecosystem.\"\n\n\"I don’t want to let companies off the hook, because they do have a responsibility in this ecosystem,\" boyd says . \"But they’re not going to produce the silver bullet that they’re being asked to produce. And I think that most critics of these companies are really naive if they think that this is an easy problem for them to fix.\"\n\nIn boyd's view, the problem we think we are describing when we use the term \"fake news\" can't be solved by blaming social-media platforms, or digital journalism and the rise of clickbait, or Macedonian teens. All of these things play a role, but they are just symptoms of a deeper issue.\n\n\"No amount of 'fixing' Facebook or Google will address the underlying factors shaping the culture and information wars in which America is currently enmeshed,\" she says.\n\nIn effect, the current obsession with fake news is just the latest version of a fight that the Internet has been waging for years against offensive content, whether it's email spam or online bullying or black hat SEO (search engine optimization) techniques, says boyd.\n\n\"The short version of it all is that we have a cultural problem, one that is shaped by disconnects in values, relationships, and social fabric. Our media, our tools, and our politics are being leveraged to help breed polarization by countless actors who can leverage these systems for personal, economic, and ideological gain.\"\n\nIf Facebook and Google crack down on \"fake news\" sites, the Microsoft researcher argues , those who have an interest in generating that kind of content will find ways around the restrictions, as many already have by using visual \"memes\" instead of links to news stories.\n\nThe issues that we need to deal with \"are socially and culturally hard,\" says boyd. They force us to confront \"how people construct knowledge and ideas, communicate with others and construct a society. They are also deeply messy, revealing divisions and fractures in beliefs and attitudes. And that means that they are not technically easy to build or implement.\"\n\nIn other words, Facebook and Google can make it harder to share (or make money from) false news reports or propaganda. But they can't solve the underlying problems because those problems are fundamentally human ones . We are going to have to figure out how to fix those ourselves. And that is a much harder assignment than just changing some features on a social platform.", "Technology stocks like Google and Facebook will not see their valuations hit by criticisms over the way they deal with inappropriate content, pioneering venture capitalist Yossi Vardi told CNBC on Friday, but added the firms will need to take more responsibility in policing what ends up on their services.\n\nVardi, who has often been dubbed the \"godfather of Israel technology\" and is the chairman of venture capital firm International Technology Ventures, said that tech companies have usually not acted until a court order has come to them, but this could change.\n\n\"Because of the magnitude and the effect of them on everybody's life and becoming the foremost media platform they have to take different issues ... they are being drafted into editing the content and again,\" Vardi said.\n\nHis comments come after the U.S. search giant came under fire from brands concerned that their advertisements on Google-owned video service YouTube were being placed next to extremist content. London newspaper The Times, found that ads from brands such as Mercedes-Benz and Waitrose were appearing next to neo-Nazi and jihadi content on YouTube. Many brands have pulled their advertising from YouTube, with the latest being AT&T and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThe news has prompted debate over whether technology firms can just take a hands-off approach, or whether they act more like media companies and edit content.\n\nGoogle's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, said on Tuesday the company is going to hire \"significant numbers of people\" and develop new tools using artificial intelligence to improve its ability to review questionable content.\n\nThis was followed on Wednesday with an announcement that the online giant was carrying out an extensive review of its advertising policies.\n\nFacebook has also dealt with criticism over its dealing with inappropriate content, particularly around the issue of fake news.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about the business impact on the likes of Facebook and Google. Vardi said that even if these firms had to bolster the number of people doing oversight on content, it would only be a small cost in comparison to the broader business.\n\n", "TOTALLY PANIC.\n\nJust kidding; please don’t do that. Google regularly issues warnings to people whose accounts are or have been targeted by state-sponsored attackers, and every time it does, users get really nervous that their emails are going to wind up on WikiLeaks.

According to Google, it means that a sophisticated attacker has tried to gain access to your account using phishing, malware or some other tactic.\n\nJust because you get a warning doesn’t mean you’ve been hacked, though.\n\n“We send these out of an abundance of caution — the notice does not necessarily mean that the account has been compromised or that there is a widespread attack. Rather, the notice reflects our assessment that a government-backed attacker has likely attempted to access the user’s account or computer through phishing or malware, for example,” Shane Huntley, a member of Google’s Threat Analysis Group, wrote.\n\nUnfortunately, you’re unlikely to hear more information, such as when the attack happened or whether or not it was successful. Google doesn’t always send the warnings out right away and doesn’t give specifics about the attack or the responsible parties because it doesn’t want to tip hackers off about how they were detected. If Google says too much, the attackers will change their tactics — and then Google might not be able to warn you about the next attack.\n\n“In order to secure some of the details of our detection, we often send a batch of warnings to groups of at-risk users at the same time, and not necessarily in real-time,” Huntley added.\n\nSo what do I do now?\n\nIt's crucially important to neither under- nor overestimate these warnings. If you get one: #1 don't panic & #2 take appropriate action. https://t.co/GwQMUbuKs4 — Stephan Somogyi (@thinkpanzer) March 24, 2017\n\nGoogle recommends several steps to secure your account. The company offers a quick Security Checkup, which lets you review the devices and apps that have access to your account and double-checks your account recovery method.\n\nGoogle makes some additional recommendations to high-risk users that will help prevent account compromise:\n\nkeep your software up-to-date (don’t let those updates languish forever because you don’t feel like pausing a show on Netflix long enough to let them install)\n\nenable 2-step verification on your account (you can do this through regular old text message, but Google recommends its own Authenticator app or a Security Key as the best methods)\n\ninstall Password Alert in Chrome (or another browser extension that alerts you when you enter your password on a suspicious login page)\n\nAlso, pay attention to the email address of the sender and make sure it’s someone you know and trust (rather than someone with a similar email address who’s trying to masquerade as your friend). Don’t click on links and PDFs if you don’t trust the sender. Encrypting email is kind of difficult, but consider doing it anyway, especially if you’re sending sensitive documents or information.\n\nEven if you haven’t gotten a “government-backed attack” warning yet — and you probably won’t as Google only sends them to less than 0.1 percent of users — you can take all these steps to secure your account today. A little extra security never hurts.", "Close Get email notifications on Bo Petersen daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\nWhenever Bo Petersen posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link.\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.", "While Google continues to add more features to its two social communication apps Allo and Duo, TechCrunch has learned that it has quietly been working on least one more social app. Google has been developing a new social app that lets small groups edit photos together and then organise them for future enjoyment: think Path meets Snapchat-style filters and edits meets Google’s imaging smarts.\n\nGoogle confirmed the existence of the app after we asked about it, and told us that (for now) is an experiment, one of many it’s running.\n\nBut it sounds like Google may be downplaying this a bit. According to our sources, one plan had been to launch the app during its I/O event in May — much as it did last year with Duo and Allo — although from what we understand right now there is no specific date set.\n\nCould the announcement this week of Clips from Apple, a video editing app that will also use AI, image recognition and speech recognition, also have played a part in deciding timing?\n\nWe also don’t know what name Google is planning for it, but here is what we do know.\n\nThe approach the developers are taking is not to make “yet another messaging app” but more of a collaborative social photo app. Users can create groups for sharing pictures. And then group members would all be able to edit and tag the same pictures.\n\nAlongside this, Google would apply some of its own computer vision expertise and technology — currently used across services like YouTube, Google’s image search, and Google Photos — to help users along: it will be able to identify objects in a photo to tag them and organise them and in the future search for them, as well as to help edit and apply filters to the pictures.\n\nWe think some of the photo features in the app sound a lot like Clips, the app that Apple is planning to release in April that will use “They are building a competitor to Path,” is how one person we know described it, in reference to the social app founded by Dave Morin, the investor who also was an early employee at Facebook; and Shawn Fanning and Dustin Mireau, both formerly of Napster.\n\nPath gained some early popularity for providing a way for small groups of friends to share pictures and chat with each other, one of the early counterbalances to the more open-ended, share-everything tendencies on services like Twitter and Facebook.\n\nIn a little twist of what might have been, Google even tried to buy it. But as is often the way with apps, Path eventually waned in popularity. It was eventually sold to Korean messaging giant Kakao in 2015 (it’s still around btw).\n\nGoogle has had a very patchy history when it comes to social media, and it’s an area that the company still trying to get right. The current strategy seems to be one of running a bunch of slightly different apps and efforts simultaneously to see what works, and what does not (which could be one reason why this was worked on as a separate app rather than, say, as part of an update to Google Photos).\n\nWhile Allo and Duo continue to get updates, Spaces — a group app for sharing and exploring links to things by tapping into other existing Google services, which seems closest to what it’s trying to build in the app that’s being tested now — closed down after less than a year.\n\nThen there is G+, still going but not the social networking magnet that Google once envisioned it could be. Google Wave, Google Buzz and Orkut are among the various efforts that have come and gone after failing to get enough traction.\n\nWhy keep returning to social? Because Google faces competition from the likes of Facebook, Twitter and now Snapchat for consumers’ — and thus advertisers’ — attention. Many (not all but many) users today do not think of search engines first when looking for information, deciding how to spend their money, and finding things to entertain themselves. They go to these other apps, and that ultimately can cut into Google’s mainstay advertising business and revenues.\n\nYouTube, with its focus on user-generated videos mixed with premium content like Vevo, remains Google’s most successful social play, although it’s known more for ushering in virally popular material rather than for helping to keep the conversation going around it (although Google does do some of that, too, in videos’ comments section).\n\nThe fact that Google is considering how it can leverage some of the tech that’s been built to help power image search on YouTube, its search portal and its Photos app, to see if that can be used to get a foothold in social is interesting. As is the timing: Apple will be releasing its own gentle step into social media apps — Clips, which lets you edit videos and then share them on various social networks — in April.", "Google has rolled a new feature into its mapping software that makes it possible for mobile users to share their location with others in real time.\n\nBoth iOS and Android users will have access to the feature when updating their software. Whether you’re backpacking through the countryside for a week or just going on a grocery run, your friends and family can follow along with where in the world you are, on their own mobile devices. Beyond the immediate value of being able to broadcast, “Hey, here I am!” you’ll also be able to share your navigated route in progress, letting your contacts see how far away you are from your destination and when you’ll arrive.\n\nTo share your location this way, tap the blue dot that represents your physical location on the map. Tap “Share location,” select who to share with and for how long, and you’re done. You can even send a link to your live location through a messaging service; if your recipients don’t have an Android or iOS device, they can click the link and track you in a Web browser.\n\nWe think Google Maps is one of the best online mapping services there is, and the addition of real-time location sharing only makes it more appealing. In case you didn’t know all the other features wrapped inside this robust cartographic solution, we thought we’d remind you of them.\n\nGPS directions automatically reroute you around traffic.\n\nGoogle owns Waze, a peer-driven traffic monitoring network that lets drivers report road conditions, speed traps, and accidents. Using this valuable, dynamic data, Google’s navigation system will adapt to reflect a better route when conditions should change.\n\nStore your maps offline as you travel without WiFi.\n\nWhether you’re going off the grid or just want to save on monthly bandwidth, Google Maps lets you download custom maps to your specification. With the map data already downloaded, you can zoom in and out on details as your heart desires, without needing any internet connection. To download an area for offline browsing, search for the location and select the \"download\" tab to the right of the share button. You can also use the left-hand drop-down menu by search to select “offline areas” and add a location.\n\nPlan a ski vacation.\n\nGoogle Maps isn’t just about driving directions; it also includes bike and ski trails. Search for a resort (like Breckenridge in Colorado), then zoom in to see trail details. You’ll likely want to pair this trick with Google’s offline map functionality — mountains aren’t known for being great cellular hotspots.\n\nGet oriented quickly.\n\nHow’s your sense of direction? Google wants to help. If you don’t know which direction you’re facing, just tap the compass in the top right corner of your screen, and the map will adjust to match your real-world direction and perspective.\n\nAlways take the easiest bike route.\n\nPutting elevation information at your fingertips, Google Maps will quickly let you know if your bike ride home will be a killer climb or a leisurely ride. The pros and racers will want to find the sickest hills to train on, while the rest of us will simply look for the flattest route home.\n\nSave commonly used addresses for quicker navigation.\n\nStop typing out addresses for work and home when you could just be typing “work” and “home.” In the side menu of the Google Maps mobile app, tap \"Your places,\" then enter your commonly searched addresses, saving each one with an identifying name.\n\nUse Lists to manage your vacation and sightseeing.\n\nGoogle quietly launched a new feature in February that lets you create, update, and share lists of places you want to visit. When you locate a place in Google Maps, add it to a list by tapping on the place name, tapping “Save,” then adding it to your list of choice.\n\nIdentify the best time to go grocery shopping or get a good seat at the bar.\n\nGoogle Maps will tell you how busy you can expect a given location to be before you arrive. With a business or other location selected, the mobile app will give you an hourly breakdown by day, pointing to how much foot traffic you can expect to encounter while you're out and about.", "Stanton is from New York, went to college in Tennessee, ditched the East Coast for Silicon Valley in her 20s, and did a stint as director of citizen participation in the Obama administration and as a technology advisor in the State Department before heading back to California. International travel has helped broaden her horizons; she was serving as vice president of Twitter's international business when the company went public. That now influences what Stanton looks for when she's hiring.\n\n\n\n\"I look for people with international experience, something I believe strongly in. People who speak foreign languages, I think, have always stood out to me,\" Stanton said, adding that she looks for those qualities even in roles that don't require it. \"I think it just brings a different lens and a different empathy, a different perspective to things.\"\n\n\n\nAs someone who hadn't traveled internationally when I started my career, I couldn't help but notice that in some ways, Stanton's preference for well-traveled people could be as limiting as Google's preference for coders as product managers. The key, it seems, is to show you can deliver what the job requires even if your resume isn't the obvious fit.", "The AI battle on our Android phones is getting serious. After Google added Assistant to millions of handsets running Marshmallow and Nougat, Amazon followed by adding Alexa to the Mate 9. And now Microsoft is looking to enhance its new position on the lock screen.\n\nMicrosoft added Cortana to the Android lock screen earlier this month, but it was little more than a feed of information with news, calendar appointments, and weather. With the latest update, Cortana on the lock screen has been enhanced to allow lock-screen interactions, giving Google Assistant a serious run for its money.\n\nThe feature, which can be enabled inside the Cortana app, adds a familiar circle to your lock screen that can be swiped to the right to see your Google Now-style series of cards. At the bottom of that screen you’ll also see a new microphone icon. Tap it and it'll take you to a new screen where you’ll be able to ask Cortana questions just like you would in the app.\n\nGreenbot You can now talk to Cortana right on the lock screen of your Android phone.\n\nIn addition to the new lock screen functionality, Microsoft has also updated the Cortana feed on Android to provide information about your upcoming schedule, commute, and reminders, as well as the ability to quickly add reminders and new calendar items to your day. Lists are also easier to access now so you can quickly manage your tasks.\n\nCortana also plays nicer with Windows 10, syncing your reminders and letting you respond to calls and texts on your PC. The update is rolling out to the Google Play Store, but if you’re not seeing it, you can get it early by side-loading the APK from APKMirror.\n\nAI vs. AI: Suddenly our phones are getting very crowded. With Assistant and Cortana both accessible from the lock screen, and now Alexa beginning to cross over to Android, it’s going to be interesting to see how Google can fend off the infiltrators. No AI assistant is perfect, but they all have their strengths, so Google is going to need to keep teaching Assistant new tricks if it wants to keep winning the battle over our phones.", "For a mind to be capable of tackling anything, it has to have a memory.\n\nHumans are exceptionally good at transferring old skills to new problems. Machines, despite all their recent wins against humans, aren’t. This is partly due to how they’re trained: artificial neural networks like Google’s DeepMind learn to master a singular task and call it quits. To learn a new task, it has to reset, wiping out previous memories and starting again from scratch.\n\nThis phenomenon, quite aptly dubbed “catastrophic forgetting,” condemns our AIs to be one-trick ponies.\n\nNow, taking inspiration from the hippocampus, our brain’s memory storage system, researchers at DeepMind and Imperial College London developed an algorithm that allows a program to learn one task after another, using the knowledge it gained along the way.\n\nWhen challenged with a slew of Atari games, the neural network flexibly adapted its strategy and mastered each game, while conventional, memory-less algorithms faltered.\n\n“The ability to learn tasks in succession without forgetting is a core component of biological and artificial intelligence,” writes the team in their paper, which was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n“If we’re going to have computer programs that are more intelligent and more useful, then they will have to have this ability to learn sequentially,” says study lead author Dr. James Kirkpatrick, adding that the study overcame a “significant shortcoming” in artificial neural networks and AI.\n\nMaking Memories\n\nThis isn’t the first time DeepMind has tried to give their AIs some memory power.\n\nLast year, the team set their eyes on a kind of external memory module, somewhat similar to a human working memory—the ability to keep things in mind while using them to reason or solve problems.\n\nCombining a neural network with a random access memory (better known as RAM), the researchers showed that their new hybrid system managed to perform multi-step reasoning, a type of task that’s long stumped conventional AI systems.\n\nBut it had a flaw: the hybrid, although powerful, required constant communication between the two components—not an elegant solution, and a total energy sink.\n\nIn this new study, DeepMind backed away from computer storage ideas, instead zooming deep into the human memory machine—the hippocampus—for inspiration.\n\nAnd for good reason. Artificial neural networks, true to their name, are loosely modeled after their biological counterparts. Made up of layers of interconnecting neurons, the algorithm takes in millions of examples and learns by adjusting the connection between the neurons—somewhat like fine-tuning a guitar.\n\nA very similar process occurs in the hippocampus. What’s different is how the connections change when learning a new task. In a machine, the weights are reset, and anything learned is forgotten.\n\nIn a human, memories undergo a kind of selection: if they help with subsequent learning, they become protected; otherwise, they’re erased. In this way, not only are memories stored within the neuronal connections themselves (without needing an external module), they also stick around if they’re proven useful.\n\nThis theory, called “synaptic consolidation,” is considered a fundamental aspect of learning and memory in the brain. So of course, DeepMind borrowed the idea and ran with it.\n\nCrafting an Algorithm\n\nThe new algorithm mimics synaptic consolidation in a simple way.\n\nAfter learning a game, the algorithm pauses and figures out how helpful each connection was to the task. It then keeps the most useful parts and makes those connections harder to change as it learns a new skill.\n\n\"[This] way there is room to learn the new task but the changes we've applied do not override what we've learned before,” says Kirkpatrick.\n\nThink of it like this: visualize every connection as a spring with different stiffness. The more important a connection is for successfully tackling a task, the stiffer it becomes and thus subsequently harder to change.\n\n“For this reason, we called our algorithm Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC),” the authors explained in a blog post introducing the algorithm.\n\nGame On\n\nTo test their new algorithm, the team turned to DeepMind’s favorite AI training ground: Atari games.\n\nPreviously, the company unveiled a neural network-based AI called Deep Q-Network (DQN) that could teach itself to play Atari games as well as any human player. From Space Invaders to Pong, the AI mastered our nostalgic favorites, but only one game at a time.\n\n\"After 20 million plays with each game, the team found that their new AI mastered seven out of the ten games with a performance as good as any human player.\"\n\nThe team now pitted their memory-enhanced DQN against its classical version, and put the agents through a random selection of ten Atari games. After 20 million plays with each game, the team found that their new AI mastered seven out of the ten games with a performance as good as any human player.\n\nIn stark contrast, without the memory boost, the classical algorithm could barely play a single game by the end of training. This was partly because the AI never learned to play more than one game and always forgot what it had learned when moving on to a new one.\n\n“Today, computer programs cannot learn from data adaptively and in real time.\n\nWe have shown that catastrophic forgetting is not an insurmountable challenge for neural networks,” the authors say.\n\nMachine Brain\n\nThat’s not to say EWC is perfect.\n\nOne issue is the possibility of a “blackout catastrophe”: since the connections in EWC can only become less plastic over time, eventually the network saturates. This locks the network into a single unchangeable state, during which it can no longer retrieve memories or store new information.\n\nThat said, “We did not observe these limitations under the more realistic conditions for which EWC was designed—likely because the network was operating well under capacity in these regimes,” explained the authors.\n\nPerformance wise, the algorithm was a sort of “jack-of-all-trades”: decent at plenty, master of none. Although the network retained knowledge from learning each game, its performance for any given game was worse than traditional neural networks dedicated to that one game.\n\nOne possible stumbling block is that the algorithm may not have accurately judged the importance of certain connections in each game, which is something that needs to be further optimized, explain the authors.\n\n“We have demonstrated that [EWC] can learn tasks sequentially, but we haven’t shown that it learns them better because it learns them sequentially,” says Kirkpatrick. “There’s still room for improvement.”\n\n\"The team hopes that their work will nudge AI towards the next big thing: general-purpose intelligence.\"\n\nBut the team hopes that their work will nudge AI towards the next big thing: general-purpose intelligence, in which AIs achieve the kind of adaptive learning and reasoning that come to humans naturally.\n\nWhat’s more, the work could also feedback into neurobiological theories of learning.\n\nSynaptic consolidation was previously only proven in very simple examples. Here we showed that the same theories can be applied in a more realistic and complex context—it really shows that the theory could be key to retaining our memories and know-how, explained the authors. After all, to emulate is to understand.\n\nOver the past decade, neuroscience and machine learning have become increasingly intertwined. And no doubt our mushy thinking machines have more to offer their silicon brethren, and vice-versa.\n\n“We hope that this research represents a step towards programs that can learn in a more flexible and efficient way,” the authors say.\n\nImage Credit: Shutterstock", "Google recently ruffled some feathers when a post from Breitbart News, the controversial news outlet associated with the alt-right, appeared in its “Top stories” section on a search for “great barrier reef.”\n\n“How on earth is @BreitbartNews getting the #1 slot in Google results when it comes to Science/Nature News,” Cody Brown wrote in a tweet that went viral, and sparked a discussion about how Google ranks news sources.\n\nHow on earth is @BreitbartNews getting the #1 slot in Google results when it comes to Science/Nature News pic.twitter.com/AIpMYrJ38b — Cody Brown (@CodyBrown) March 22, 2017\n\nThere are a few things in this incident worth noting. The first is that Google’s not apologizing for it. Google says the job of its search engine is to present a wide variety of news and views (opinions).\n\nNot necessarily the news\n\nBut even if you agree with that position, there's another problem that Google isn't addressing. And it's going to come up again and again.\n\nOn its face, “Top stories” certainly looks like a straightforward section where Google picks the top news articles on a given topic and presents them to you. (Until just a few months ago this separate carousel of links and images, which appears at the top of Google's desktop search results, was literally even called “In the news”).\n\nBut Google considers “Top stories” to be part of Google Search, which uses different criteria than Google News when choosing which articles to show readers. Web search results use broader standards to include news “and views,” and in this case, a Breitbart column that is definitely not a news report.\n\nNow whether Google’s search engine should be ranking Breitbart's “views” about the Great Barrier Reef so high in any kind of web results is a separate debate. It's worth noting that Google has also repeatedly struggled with its web search engine promoting tons of conspiracy theories.\n\nBut leaving that issue aside, it’s clear that Google's “Top stories” section continues to be very confusing for users at a time when many are struggling to discern what's objective information from reputable sources. Google's confusing nomenclature is especially problematic because Google has an editorially-vetted news product called Google News, which is wildly popular and totally separate.\n\nSecret ways\n\nSo then the next question is, would Breitbart show up as one of the top stories in Google News?\n\nTo be in Google News, publications first need to go through a human approval process to be labeled a legitimate news site. The first thing to note is, yes, Breitbart has been let onto the Google News platform. If you search for Breitbart in Google News, it’s there.\n\nBut even though Breitbart is on Google News, I personally haven’t noticed it showing up near the top of any of my Google News queries, nor have I seen any hand-wringing over that online. That doesn’t mean it hasn’t, however, or won’t in the future.\n\nThe inner workings of Google News, and how it ranks news sites, are kept secret by Google. But last month, Business Insider published a set of recollections of people who used to vet websites for Google News. Three separate people with direct knowledge of the process confirmed that, at least a few years back, there was a method to let publications onto Google News and then manually de-rank them so they wouldn’t show up prominently. This would happen if a site was considered, by the human reviewers, to be biased or untrustworthy, but technically fit the criteria of “news.” The site wouldn’t be informed that it had been internally flagged and lowered in Google's rankings.\n\nGoogle has denied that such a process exists.\n\nBut it will be interesting to see, as time goes on, how prominently sites like Breitbart show up in Google News results, especially versus how they show up in Google Search, including the “Top Stories” section.", "1.

Another, for Walmart, sat atop a masked man crouching with fierce dogs.\n\nWhile the ad world has long harbored resentment toward Google for its secretive ways, the videos were more than Havas could stomach. Havas’ UK boss, Paul Frampton, immediately yanked all of his clients’ commercials from the web giant.\n\n“We have a duty of care to our clients in the UK marketplace . . . where we can be assured that that environment is safe, regulated to the degree necessary and additive to their brands’ objectives,” Frampton said in a statement.\n\nDays later, Google apologized and promised to fix the problem — but it wasn’t enough. Within a week, AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, PepsiCo, Wal-mart, General Motors, Starbucks, Verizon, JPMorgan Chase and other mega-advertisers had followed suit, pulling their ads from Google’s platforms in the US.\n\nIt was a moment of reckoning for Google.

But suddenly that excuse wasn’t cutting it anymore.\n\n“They’ve always maintained they were sort of digital engineers standing there with their digital [wrenches], trying to tighten the nuts on their digital pipes and not being responsible for the content that was going through the pipes,” Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the WPP Group, the biggest advertiser in the world with $102 billion in client ad money, said on CNBC.\n\nBut after the Havas snafu, “They can’t just say, ‘Look, we’re a technology company, we have nothing to do with the content that is appearing on our digital pages.’ ”\n\nIn fact, many industry leaders are now charging that Google and other tech giants, like Facebook, aren’t just web platforms; they’re publishers — like a news organization or a TV network — and they must shoulder the responsibility that comes with that role. “We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company,” Sorrell said.\n\nWith brands including Google Maps and its Gmail service, Google has a market cap of $562.4 billion and it controls 41 percent of the $83 billion US digital ad market. (Facebook controls 14.7 percent of the US digital ad business, according to eMarketer.) But its once-impenetrable brand equity is now in danger of evaporating, at least with a growing band of major advertisers.\n\nThey can’t just say, ‘Look, we’re a technology company, we have nothing to do with the content that is appearing on our digital pages.’\n\nTraditionally, marketers spend considerable time and energy ensuring media outlets don’t run their ads next to clashing content. Fast-food ads, for example, are expected not to run alongside stories about dieting or diabetes. Airlines typically tell TV news outlets to drop their ads from breaks when plane crashes are reported.\n\nBut online? It’s a whole other story. There are few checks and balances.\n\nGoogle argues it can never guarantee where ads land, because it’s contending with 400 hours of content uploaded every minute. Google also operates YouTube, one of the biggest destinations online offering advertisers a billion hours of viewing content per day, and a global ad exchange called DoubleClick, which automatically serves up ads on millions of websites all over the world.\n\nBecause of its size and dominance, for a long time Google called the shots. While other, less-important outlets were forced to provide advertisers with data that showed whether or not their online campaigns were effective, Google has long refused to share those metrics.\n\nThe company’s algorithm, which it uses to filter out unsavory content when placing ads, is also secret. But now it’s also clear it doesn’t work. The Times of London was the first to reveal Google’s glitch, with an investigation earlier this month exposing the Havas problem and setting off the advertising boycott.\n\nGoogle’s response to the Times of London’s findings only seemed to compound the problem. On Monday, Google’s European chief, Matt Brittin, told advertisers at a conference that the company already had the tools to keep their ads off bad content, they just weren’t using them correctly. He added that Google would step in to help them figure it out and claimed that 98 percent of flagged content is reviewed within 24 hours.\n\n(But after flagging several bad ad placements to Google that weren’t rectified within the 24 hour period, the Times of London proved this wasn’t entirely true.)\n\nBy Tuesday, Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler, in a blog post, pledged to do more: “We know advertisers don’t want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values. So, starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content,” he wrote.\n\n“In cases where advertisers find their ads were served where they shouldn’t have been, we plan to offer a new escalation path to make it easier for them to raise issues.”\n\nMeanwhile, Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has been unable to promise a zero-tolerance policy. Appearing on Fox Business on Thursday, Schmidt stated that while Google “can get pretty close” to making sure ads won’t appear next to extremist content, he can’t guarantee it.\n\nAnd now the damage may be too big to contain.\n\nIn May, big digital players including Google, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and AOL/Yahoo will start pitching their business as part of the “Digital New Fronts” — where marketers aiming to advertise the upcoming TV season commit the majority of their budgets to web outlets.\n\nIn the coming weeks, as Google hopes to grab TV ad budgets, execs will likely be spending most of their time discussing issues of brand safety, notes Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser.\n\nAdvertisers spend about $70 billion on TV ads in the US, and Wieser estimates Google could lose as much as $1 billion in new ad money as a result of the boycott and its aftermath. “Google’s stated solution was late and woeful. Given numerous opportunities to nip it in the bud, they’ve seemingly made it worse.”\n\nWieser said Google is “attempting to minimize the problem rather than eliminating it. We think that Google will probably need to articulate goals that sound more like a zero-tolerance policy, to alleviate concerns before it can fully recover.” On Monday, Wieser showed his lack of confidence in Google stock, downgrading Alphabet from a buy to a hold. By Friday, Alphabet stock was $814.43, losing $35 per share in a week.\n\nWhile Google has allowed hate-speech content to run riot on its platforms, it is also accused of restricting ad funds to legitimate websites.\n\nIsrael-based Matan Uziel runs a serious documentary series on YouTube featuring women discussing rape and abuse. It includes, among other subjects, ex-models discussing how they became bulimic working in the fashion business. He says his organization supports Emma Watson’s UN initiative, “HeForShe.”\n\nUziel says Google served ads to his channel on YouTube until December, when suddenly the company halted the flow.\n\nUziel says he’s complained to YouTube that his female-empowerment series has been prevented from monetizing the clips in the “Real Women, Real Stories,” online series.\n\nHe pointed out that videos glorifying drugs and showing self-harm are able to monetize their ads, perhaps because the content of the ads isn’t so obvious to Google’s algorithm. He says he has called on YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki to address the problem but got no response.\n\n“It is a dark time in the US for women,” Uziel said. “Google owns YouTube and, like any multinational tech company, they are supposedly acting in their own best interests. But they are undermining their creators.” (Google declined to comment on Uziel’s claims.)\n\nStunned by the volume of complaints from major advertisers, on Friday Google issued a client memo detailing the changes it is making. The firm is promising to use a new type of artificial intelligence to flag inappropriate content that will even pick up a T-shirt bearing bad language, according to Bloomberg, which obtained the memo. It will also retool a video verification process and create a staff hotline to respond to complaints.\n\nGoogle said it would implement changes by Sunday.\n\nBut some are saying Google needs to go even further, hiring actual human editors who can judge the nuances of content more effectively than an automated system. Google’s many rivals in the space, including AppNexus and AOL’s Marketplace, note that they have much tighter policies on what’s acceptable. “They need to hire more data scientists,” said one digital ad executive.\n\nCritics say Google, which was cooked up nearly 20 years ago in a Menlo Park, Calif., garage by two college kids, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, is finally having to grow up, take responsibility for its content and deal with the issues that old-school publishers have long had to face. “It’s a shame it took this kind of a pressure,” one digital advertising executive told The Post.\n\nJon Bond, a veteran ad exec who works with In-N-Out Burger as co-chairman of ad agency holding company Shipyard, added that technology companies’ insensitivity to people is a huge weak point.\n\n“Google isn’t about people, and that’s going to bite them,” Bond told The Post. “They’ve never had to go to a meeting where something inappropriate got blown up by the press and consumers wrote letters to the CEO.”\n\nHe said Google needs to fine-tune its artificial intelligence so that it has more of a human touch. “It’s impossible to be perfect. People aren’t perfect in the print world. But there is an acceptable range and they have to get closer to where the publishing world is — where it’s humans making decisions.”", "Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

Web-connected speakers that not only play music but offer helpful information and obey spoken commands are jostling for a place in your living room.\n\nAt the end of last year, Amazon finally released its Echo speaker in the UK - over a year after launching the device in the US.\n\nEcho comes with an integrated voice assistant called Alexa that can answer questions, make to-do lists, set alarms and provide weather, traffic and other information in real-time.\n\nNow Google is preparing to launch its rival device, called Google Home, with its own voice assistant that can perform many of the same tasks.\n\n(Photo: REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach)\n\nSo how do the two devices stack up? And which one will win the battle for your heart, and your home?\n\nDesign\n\nAmazon Echo is a 23.5 cm tall cylindrical speaker with a diameter of 8.3cm. It is fairly heavy compared to other wireless speakers, and somewhat monolithic in appearance.\n\nThe bottom half of the device is covered by a speaker grille, while the top of Echo has a ring of light that you can turn to adjust volume, and buttons for mute and activation.\n\nThe speaker only comes in black and white colour options.\n\nBy contrast, Google Home is quite squat - with a shape supposedly inspired by wine glasses and candles.\n\nIt has a sloped top, with a touch-capacitive display and four coloured LED lights to provide visual feedback, and a single physical mute button on the back, which you can press to prevent Google from listening to \"hot words\".\n\nThe bottom of the unit is covered by a speaker grille and can be swapped out for different coloured shells to suit your personal taste. There are six shell options in fabric or metal.\n\nSound\n\nIf you're going to invest in a speaker, the most important thing is that it sounds good.\n\nAmazon Echo is a 1.0 channel speaker, meaning that it is a single speaker with one tweeter and one woofer. That's pretty basic considering that, for most people, playing music will be its primary function.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Home boasts a \"high-excursion driver\" with a \"dual passive radiator\" design that Google claims delivers \"crystal-clear highs and deep lows\". That means a lot of big sound from a small package.\n\nGoogle Home speakers can also be synced together, or used to control other speakers that have a Chromecast Audio device plugged into them, essentially creating a multi-room speaker system.\n\nVoice assistant\n\nAmazon's voice assistant Alexa is capable of understanding simple commands, or even a series of commands, but she can't conduct two-way conversations.\n\nAlexa's default search engine is Bing, meaning that responses to all the questions you ask will be derived form the Microsoft-owned search engine.\n\nYou have to phrase your questions in the right way to get the answers you want, but Amazon claims the more you use Echo, the more Alexa will adapt to your speech patterns, vocabulary and personal preferences.\n\nGoogle Assistant taps into the superior power of Google's search engine, allowing you to ask more complex questions in a more natural way.\n\nYou can also ask follow-up questions, so it feels more like a conversation.\n\nMoreover, the Assistant on Google Home is the same as the Assistant built into Android smartphones, so data can be shared across both devices.\n\nThe irritating thing about Google Assistant is that it doesn't have a name, so whereas you can wake up Amazon's assistant by just saying \"Alexa\", with Google Home you have to say \"OK Google\" every time you want to talk to it.\n\nCompatibility\n\nWhere Amazon Echo excels is in its compatibility with other apps.\n\nThe speaker already boasts Uber, Skyscanner, National Rail, and JustEat among its \"skills\", as well as several smart home appliances such as Hive, Netatmo and Philips Hue.\n\nIn fact, Amazon claims that more than 130 apps are supported by Amazon Echo and Alexa voice commands.\n\nGoogle Home can link up with Philips Hue, Nest, Samsung SmartThings and IFTTT - as well as its own Chromecast devices - but that's about it so far.\n\nBoth the Echo and Home are compatible with the most common music streaming services - most notably Spotify and TuneIn.\n\nWith the Echo, you can tap into Amazon's own music library and Prime Music offerings, while the Home links up with Google Play Music and YouTube Music.\n\nPrice and availability\n\nAmazon Echo echo went on sale in the UK on 28 September, at a price of £149.99. It is available at Argos, Currys, John Lewis, PC World, and Tesco, as well as from Amazon itself.\n\nGoogle Home is not yet available in the UK, but has gone on sale in the US for $129.\n\n(Photo: Reuters)\n\nEven if Google decides to convert that number into pounds when it crosses the pond, it will still be over £20 cheaper than Amazon's rival.\n\nVerdict\n\nIn many aspects, Google Home seems to come out on top in the battle of the smart speakers. It's smaller, more customisable, and its voice assistant is powered by Google search, which many regard as superior to Bing.\n\nOn the other hand, it's early days for the device - no one in the UK has had a chance to put it through its paces yet, and it lacks the breadth of integrations with third party apps that Amazon Echo boasts.\n\nIf you're hungry to get your hands on a smart speaker in the UK now, your choice has already been made for you, as Google Home is currently only available in the US.\n\nHowever, if you're willing to hold out a little longer, you may find that Google Home has more to offer.", "You are the owner of this article.", "Verizon also told CNBC it pulled some ads from the platform after learning that they were appearing on \"non-sanctioned\" websites. Verizon said it wanted to make sure its brand was not negatively impacted and was investigating the \"weak links\" with advertising partners. Verizon said it's also pulling ads from other digital non-search properties, not just those owned by Google.\n\nThe telecom companies join other companies that have stepped back from Google, after an investigation from The Times of London found that ads for Mercedes-Benz and Marie Curie were running next to jihadist and neo-Nazi content.\n\nGoogle apologized and revamped its ad policy on Tuesday, especially on YouTube. Google said it will start \"removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people,\" and will change the default safety setting for ads.\n\nGoogle said on Wednesday that it couldn't comment on AT&T, citing a policy against commenting on individual customers. But the company said it is raising the bar for its ads to safeguard brands.\n\n\"[A]s announced, we've begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nGoogle makes most of its money from advertisements and is one of the top online ad providers in the world. The problem of offensive content also plagues Google's competitors — especially when it comes to video, advertising professionals told CNBC.\n\n— CNBC's Michelle Castillo contributed to this report", "Google is expanding support for rich cards globally. Yesterday, Google updated the blog post that originally announced this feature back in May 2016. In this update, Google said rich cards are now available globally.\n\nOriginally, rich cards launched in the US just for movie and recipe websites. That has expanded over the months, both in terms the types of websites that are supported and what geographic versions of Google search support it.\n\nNow, rich cards are fully supported globally. Google wrote:\n\nIn 2016, we launched rich cards in the US, creating a new way for site owners to present previews of their content on the Search results page. Starting today, sites all over the world can now build rich cards across Google Search. By building Rich Cards, you have a new opportunity to attract more engaged users to your page. Users can swipe through recipes in the UK from sites like BBC Good Food or browse movies in Mexico from Cinepapaya or view restaurants in Germany from Prinz.de. Also, rich cards support the AMP format. So if you build AMP pages, users will be able to swipe near instantly from page to page.\n\nGoogle has not written or announced this expansion on any of their channels yet. We found this thanks to a tip from @ShobhitSaxena22.", "\"Super widescreen\" phones need some special attention if you want your app to look great.\n\nThe age of larger display format phones is here. LG's G6 sports an 18:9 screen aspect ratio and the Galaxy S8 brought an 18.5:9 display to the party. Since those two phones will be the most popular high-end Android models for 2017, Google has posted a quickie on the Android Developers blog to make sure everyone building an app knows how to take advantage of all the screen, all the time.\n\nThis isn't anything new. For better or worse, Android apps support scaling and resizing really well and it only takes a few lines of code to make sure an app uses the screen without being squished, stretched or sporting the dreaded black bars of nothingness.\n\nFirst, you need to make sure the maximum aspect ratio is expressed as a floating-point number instead of an integer in the app's <application> element. Then make sure your app supports an aspect ratio of 2.1 or higher. Set this in the <application> element, too. You'll find complete instructions and a bit of demo code at the Android Developers site.\n\nThese two small changes will make a world of difference for everyone who uses a phone with a large-format aspect ratio and we expect to see more phones adopt it and join the \"super widescreen\" world.", "Google Chrome's 'Incognito mode' offers internet users a way to use the web without fear of it appearing in their browser history.\n\nWhile it was once marketed as a way to secretly buy gifts or plan anniversary surprises, most users know it as a way to privately browse porn.\n\nNow Google has addressed the elephant in the room by adding a cheeky message for heavy users of its incognito mode.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nGoogle Chrome's 'Incognito mode' offers internet users a way to browse the web without fear of any activity appearing in their history.

Shortcuts are a new row of icons that appear below the Google search box that can be tapped so people can see the latest weather in the area, movie times, suggestions on places to eat or scores of their latest teams without typing anything into the search box. (Photo: Google via AP)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO - Google wants to make it easier for you to find answers and recommendations on smartphones without having to think about what to ask its search engine.\n\nIts new feature, called “shortcuts,” will appear as a row of icons below the Google search box. Where now you’d have to ponder and then speak or type a request, the shortcuts will let you tap the icons to get the latest weather, movie showtimes, sports scores, restaurant recommendations and other common requests.\n\nThe shortcuts will begin appearing Tuesday in updates to Google’s app for iPhones, Android phones and its mobile website. The Android app will also include various tools such as a currency converter, a language translator and an ATM locator, which you can also summon with a tap. Those tools may eventually make it to the iPhone as well, although Google says it doesn’t know when.\n\nYOUR BACKUP BRAIN\n\nThese shortcuts are the latest step in Google’s quest to turn its search engine into a secondary brain that anticipates people’s needs and desires. The search engine gleans these insights by analyzing your past requests and, when you allow it, tracking your location, a practice that periodically raises privacy concerns about Google’s power to create digital profiles of its users.\n\nBased on the knowledge that Google already has accumulated, its shortcuts feature may already list your favorite sports teams or recommend nearby restaurants serving cuisines you prefer.\n\nShortcuts also show how Google’s search engine has been adapting to its audience, now that smartphones have become the primary way millions or of people stay connected to the internet.\n\nGOING MOBILE\n\nSince more than half of requests for Google’s search engine now come from smartphones, the Mountain View, California, company has adapted its services to smaller screens, touch keyboards and apps instead of websites.\n\nEarly in that process, Google tweaked its search engine to answer many requests with factual summaries at the top of its results page, a change from simply displaying a list of links to other websites. Voice-recognition technology also allows you to speak your request into a phone instead of typing it.\n\nThe transition is going well so far. Google’s revenue rose 20 percent last year to $89 billion, propelled by digital ads served up on its search engine, YouTube and Gmail. Although shortcuts won’t initially show ads after you tap them, Google typically sells marketing space if a feature or service becomes popular.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://jsonl.in/2nwQt7l", "Avere, the filer and public cloud storage accelerator supplier, has scored a $27m E-round of funding, with Google proper providing some of the funds.\n\nAvere, founded in 2008, accelerates access to files in NAS arrays by using a multi-tiered media approach and treating different IO types, such as read and write, sequential and random, differently so as to optimise the system for faster accesses.\n\nThere was participation from existing investors - Menlo Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Tenaya Capital and Western Digital Technologies - as well as its new investor, Google Inc, which notably did not invest through its funding arm, GV (Google Ventures).\n\nInitially the amount was reported as $14m but, after the initial funding announcement was made, there was an additional amount added to the round by the investors, bringing it up to $27m.\n\nThe company says it wants to use the new funds to drive product innovation and help expand its hybrid cloud product offerings.\n\nCEO, president and co-founder Ron Bianchini said: “In 2016 alone, Avere has grown its cloud business by 97 per cent, nearly doubling growth from the previous year, and closed the year with cloud offerings driving close to half of our annual bookings.”\n\nThe nine-year-old firm developed its technology to run in remote and branch offices, also to front-end public cloud storage, and then extended its software to run in the public cloud.\n\nThe company sees its customers using a mix of on-premises (private) and public cloud storage and compute facilities; it’s a hybrid world as far as it is concerned.\n\nIt received a $15m A-round in 2009, a $17m B-round in 2010, a $20m C-round in 2012, and another $20m in a 2014 D-round. With the latest E-round, total funding is now $97m.\n\nWe asked Bianchini some questions around the new funding.\n\nEl Reg: How far away is profitability?\n\nRon Bianchini: Our current forecast show us reaching profitability in 2018.\n\nEl Reg: What are the features of the hybrid cloud (in more detail than the release) that you will be using the E-round funding for?\n\nRon Bianchini: We're not ready to discuss new cloud products at this time; however, big areas of continued focus for us are ease of deployment within the public cloud and further in-cloud performance and scalability enhancements.\n\nEl Reg: Will you aim to take advantage of 3D Xpoint and possibly other storage-class memory media in your products? Where would such media fit in your existing media tiers in your hardware?\n\nRon Bianchini: It is not on the roadmap at this time, but we like to think of our architecture as storage media agnostic. When one type of media has outlived its usefulness, there is no technical reason why it can't or shouldn't be replaced with something better.\n\nEl Reg: What public clouds do you support, which are on the roadmap? What protocols will be used to access them?\n\nRon Bianchini: We support Google, AWS and Azure (bursting only). No others are currently on the roadmap - these three representing more than 90 per cent market share of public cloud spend. We use S3 to access the storage portion of the cloud and NAS protocols for cloudbursting.\n\nEl Reg: Do you have a multi-cloud strategy, with your customers able to use two or more public clouds simultaneously?\n\nRon Bianchini: Yes, this is one of the strengths of an Avere solution, to provide customers the ability to mirror storage between clouds with our FlashMirror product. This is a popular feature for customers who want to avoid lock-in to a single cloud provider.\n\nEl Reg: Any Internet of Things edge device interest from Avere?\n\nRon Bianchini: We are interested in supporting any devices that speak the same protocol language as we do.\n\n+Comment\n\nFishing for new product info in Avere’s pool is a pretty unrewarding pastime. Our thinking is that $27m is a healthy dose of cash and that some of it will fund software development to enhance the in-cloud product’s performance and scalability.\n\nWe also think that on-premises FXT kit will get easier interaction with the public cloud, but it doesn't take a genius to work that out. ®", "A side-by-side look at the features and specs for the new Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 and the Google Pixel C\n\nBefore the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, \"Google Pixel\" meant the Google Pixel C, a high-end Android-running tablet. Samsung has just released an Android tablet of its own, the Galaxy Tab S3, with a similar price point and a few extra perks. Here's how their specs and features compare.\n\nSize\n\nThe Pixel C is a larger tablet overall, edging out the Tab S3 in height and width, but not thickness.\n\nWeight\n\nIt makes sense that the Pixel C is heavier as well. It's about 17-percent heavier than the lightest Tab S3.\n\nNote that both the dimensions and weights given are for the tablet only, and do not take into account the optional keyboard accessories (see below).\n\nBuild\n\nThe Tab S3 has a glass back panel, which is classy, but might not be the most practical option for a portable device that often gets held in one hand. The Pixel C has a no-nonsense aluminum body.\n\nColors\n\nThe Tab S3 comes in black or silver; the Pixel C is available in silver only.\n\nDisplay size\n\nThe Pixel C has a larger diagonal measurement and an unusual 1:1.4 aspect ratio. It offers about 8 percent more overall screen area than the Tab S3, which has a 4:3 aspect ratio.\n\nDisplay resolution\n\nThe Pixel C's display has more tightly-packed pixels, which could mean a sharper viewing experience. However, pixel density alone does not determine the quality of a display.\n\nSamsung has said its Tab S3 supports HDR (high dynamic range) which should mean a more realistic contrast ratio and/or greater color gamut. However, Samsung has not specified its exact HDR standard, so it's wise to take that HDR designation with a grain of salt.\n\nSpeakers\n\nThe Pixel C has standard stereo speakers, but the Tab S3 adds a second pair. In a nod to multimedia needs, Samsung's quad speakers are designed to rotate sound output based on the orientation of the tablet.\n\nFingerprint sensor\n\nOf these, only the Samsung tablet has a built-in fingerprint sensor for biometric logins.\n\nCellular connectivity option\n\nYou can pay extra for a Galaxy Tab S3 with LTE connectivity, so you can use it on your cellular data plan instead of a Wi-Fi network. There's no LTE option for the Pixel C.\n\nKeyboard support\n\nBoth makers have created optional keyboards that dock into place. Unlike Bluetooth accessories, these keyboards draw power from the tablets, so they require no additional charging of their own.\n\nKeyboards are sold separately. The Tab S3 keyboard is US$130. Google has two Pixel C keyboard options, which vary in appearance, materials and screen angle options. They cost $149 each.\n\nActive stylus\n\nThe Tab S3 supports active stylus input and even includes an S Pen in the box. No such luck with the Pixel C.\n\nCharging/data port\n\nBoth devices opt for an (increasingly universal) USB Type C charging/data port.\n\nProcessor\n\nThe Tab S3's Snapdragon 820 chip handily beats the clock speeds of the NVIDIA Tegra X1 found in the Pixel C.\n\nRAM\n\nThe Tab S3 has one more gigabyte of RAM than the Pixel C.\n\nStorage\n\nOriginally, the Pixel C was available in 32 GB and 64 GB sizes. Nowadays, the 32 GB version is difficult to find. In the US, the Google Store is only offering the 64 GB option.\n\nMicroSD\n\nIf 32 GB isn't enough storage for you, the Tab S3 also has a microSD slot for expansion up to 256 GB.\n\nCamera megapixels\n\nThe Tab S3 packs in more megapixels in both its rear and front cameras.\n\nBattery\n\nThe Pixel C's battery is a little larger overall, but battery life has many factors, and Samsung's estimate is a little higher than Google's. Of course, actual results may vary.\n\nSoftware\n\nThe Pixel C launched with Android Marshmallow but has since received the Nougat update. As a Google device, it is expected to be one of the first in line for software updates, at least for the near future.\n\nThe Tab S3 ships with Android Nougat as well, though it is skinned with Samsung's TouchWiz user interface.\n\nMultitasking\n\nBoth tablets' software allows for some degree of split-screen multitasking, so you can use/view more than one app at a time.\n\nRelease\n\nThe Pixel C has been around since December 2015, while the Galaxy Tab S3 is just starting to hit shelves.\n\nStarting price\n\nThese tablets sit at essentially the same entry price point. In the US, the Tab S3 starts at $599.99. The Google Pixel C, in its 64 GB size, retails for $599 through the Google Store. These prices do not include the optional keyboard accessories.\n\nThe 32 GB Pixel C originally retailed for $499, but since it's no longer readily available, we're referring to the 64 GB price exclusively.\n\nAt this point, it does seem as if the Tab S3 offers more compelling features – quad speakers, a stylus, microSD, a better camera – and is therefore a better value. Stock Android purists, however, may still find a place for the Pixel.\n\nWe'll post more thoughts once we complete our Tab S3 review in the near future. In the meantime, check out our hands-on impressions from MWC 2017.\n\nCorrection: The original version of this article misstated the dimensions of the Google Pixel C. We regret the error.\n\n", "For the lion's share of his five-year stint with Microsoft, Sam Ramji had a job unlike any other, acting as liaison between Microsoft and the community of open source, Linux-loving programmers it viewed as a huge threat.\n\n\"I was the odd man out,\" Ramji tells Business Insider.\n\nNowadays, Ramji is about four months into a new gig serving as VP of Product Management for Google Cloud, a service where developers rent functionally unlimited supercomputing power straight from the search engine's own global server infrastructure.\n\nAnd while Google has never been shy about its love for open source, Ramji still says his new role is \"not too different\" than his time at Microsoft. Ramji's job is \"building bridges\" with programmers, working to convince them that Google, not Microsoft or Amazon, is the right digital home for their most critical software.\n\nThe opportunity is huge, says Ramji, but so is the challenge. From his perspective, Google can win developers over, just as long as it doesn't abandon Larry Page and Sergey Brin's famous 2004 declaration that \"Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.\"\n\nIn other words, Ramji says, he thinks Google can win against the leading Amazon Web Services and the second-place Microsoft Azure clouds by \"being enterprise-y, but staying Google-y.\"\n\nThe push for enterprise\n\nUnder the leadership of VMware cofounder Diane Greene, Google Cloud has been making a major push to close its competitive gap by selling the service to large businesses.\n\nTo Ramji, the gameplan is pretty straightforward: Build a service that developers, all kinds of developers, actually like using. Very often, the programmers in even the biggest, stodgiest, most bureaucratic companies still do their own personal projects on nights and weekends.\n\n\"Enterprise developers are developers on the weekend, too,\" Ramji says. \"An enterprise developer is just a developer who works at an enterprise.\"\n\nThat's key to the Google gameplan, says Ramji. Even if the IT department is wary of giving Google Cloud a look after many years of being happy Microsoft or Amazon customers, Ramji's plan is to reach out to communities of developers and convince them to give it a shot.\n\nFrom there, Ramji highlights the progress that Google has made in getting its cloud prepped for the largest companies. A major push for Google is in making sure that its cloud computing platform integrates both with their customers data centers (called \"hybrid cloud\") as well as with other providers, including Amazon and Microsoft.\n\n\"Enterprises need a cloud provider that respects their architecture, which is multi-cloud and hybrid,\" Ramji says.\n\nThe challenge\n\nSo, that's the strategy. Now, Ramji has to think tactically about the best way of rolling out the red carpet for developers.\n\n\"There's still an awareness gap,\" says Ramji, so \"our front door has to be awesome.\"\n\nA big part of the reason Ramji made the switch from his previous gig as CEO of the Cloud Foundry Foundation, a nonprofit software organization, was because he kept hearing and seeing that Google Cloud was faster and cheaper than the competition.\n\nThat performance is great, Ramji says, and something Google is going to keep investing in. But with so much marketing buzz around each cloud, and a general perception that the major cloud platforms are pretty much equivalent feature-wise, it takes more to win over developers.\n\nHe says that stuff like offering developers free Google Cloud services, giving them plenty of documentation for how to use it, and generally working with the community is a huge help — Ramji says that Google Cloud engineers often hop into Reddit or Hacker News threads to offer help and advice.\n\nPlus, Ramji says, Google runs a few different programs to embed its engineers and systems architects in with customers, helping them build and manage their software in the same way that Google itself does.\n\n\"We're here before and after the sale,\" Ramji says.\n\nThe Google advantage\n\nThere's a more ineffable advantage held by Google, says Ramji. In his time as an industry exec, Ramji has been around the block a few times, working at tech companies large and small. But he says he's continually impressed with the sheer quantity of smart people at the company working on big-impact passion projects.\n\nHe describes the general feeling at Google as \"like a Montessori school where the kids are in charge.\"\n\nIn his experience, however limited, that means that there's also an astonishing number of Googlers who come into Google Cloud, stay for a while, and then go off to work on Google Docs or search advertising or even take posts at the self-driving car spinoff Google, and vice versa. It means a constant flow of fresh talent with different skillsets.\n\n\"We don't hire for the job, we hire for Google,\" says Ramji.\n\nIn its own way, though, that could be a potential roadblock, says Ramji. When you're inside Google, you get used to doing things at Google's pace. That has the potential to alienate Google Cloud customers, Ramji says, if they mishandle things, given that most large companies don't build software at Google's speed.\n\n\"Sometimes you'll accelerate too fast and the wheels falls off,\" Ramji says.\n\nGet the latest Google stock price here.", "Credit: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg\n\nMost Popular\n\nFresh on the heels of Facebook's header bidding endorsement, Google is moving to add dozens of technology partners and hundreds of publishers to the open beta of its header bidding alternative, called exchange bidding dynamic allocation, or EBDA.\n\nGoogle is expected to start the open beta by early May, according to insiders with direct knowledge of the program. The company declined to say more about the timing other than that the open beta will begin \"in the coming months.\"\n\nMany in the ad tech industry feverishly support header bidding because it levels a playing field that's long been dominated by Google. Header bidding lets pools of buyers place simultaneous bids on ad inventory before Google's DoubleClick gets a shot.\n\nAlthough header bidding has seen significant adoption by publishers, however, it still carries the reputation of a hacky workaround to DoubleClick. That changed last week after Facebook backed the tech, saying it would work with Index Exchange, Sonobi, Amazon, AppNexus, Sortable and Media.net to bring demand from its Audience Network to publishers using header bidding.\n\nTo put that in perspective, Facebook's endorsement was about as disruptive as an NFL team nabbing Tom Brady in free agency. It gave header bidding more legitimacy and customers while also applying significant pressure to Google and its DoubleClick empire.\n\nHow Google responds with its EBDA solution, and which tech compaines it adds to its roster (Google was notably missing from Facebook's list of partners), will have a significant impact on how marketers, publishers buy and sell digital ads and video.\n\nWill Facebook and Amazon, another major power moving into header bidding, work with Google? Probably not. Is Google going to become more transparent to maintain its dominance? More than likely. And will there be any fees for ad tech companies or publishers? Nobody knows.\n\nJonathan Bellack, director of product management at Google, said the company has been very encouraged with results of its closed beta so far.\n\n\"Exchanges are building their businesses with improved inventory access, and new players are ramping up their buying or opening negotiations with us weekly,\" he said. \"We are profoundly excited about the potential of exchange bidding to help our publishers improve their yields and exchanges to grow their businesses, without compromising user experience.\"\n\nFor nearly two decades Google has enjoyed a programmatic monopoly of sorts, working with nearly every publisher on the planet through its DoubleClick platform, which connects a firehose of ad budgets with publishers' available inventory.\n\nIt also benefits greatly from its Adx ad exchange, which lets Google cherry-pick the best inventory from the best publishers, often leaving rival ad-tech players at a severe disadvantage.\n\nBut header bidding has disrupted Google's hold on publishers by introducing a more transparent bidding process that can yield higher ad prices as well. Now Facebook will soon push a torrent of advertiser demand toward publishers that use header bidding, further sapping the inventory that Google gets to sell.\n\n\"Facebook has adopted a mantra, or code of conduct that they're willing to work with anyone that is transparent and open,\" said one high-level ad tech executive who asked to remain anonymous to protect industry relationships. \"I think that's basically a nice way of Facebook saying, 'We'll work with anyone that is not Google because Google is not transparent.\"\n\nWhether that changes under pressure remains to be seen.\n\n\"Google has had a kingdom that has been unchallenged for about 20 years, but now they're being aggressively challenged by giants like Amazon and Facebook,\" another ad-tech exec told Ad Age. \"Do they hold on to the end, or are they going to continue to open [EBDA] up and reduce potential gripes so their kingdom remains?\"\n\n\"The answer to that question is a very likely yes, but they haven't publicly come out and explain why,\" the executive added.\n\nFacebook is poised to capture 39.1%, or $16.3 billion, of the U.S. display ad market this year, up from 35.4% in 2016, according to recent figures from eMarketer. Those numbers will increase come 2019, when Facebook will control 43.7% market share, or $23.9 billion in revenue, eMarketer said.\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, will capture $5.2 billion in 2017 for 12.5% market share, down from 13.8% last year. EMarketer said Google's share of display will be 12.3% in 2019.", "Between this job and school, I write a lot, so any tool that makes that task easier is great in my book.

In the past year, local shopping queries have increased 45 percent and the search giant has doubled the number of retailers that send local inventory feeds, said Alferness. Google announced the new features at the Shoptalk e-commerce conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAlphabet's Google is battling it out with Amazon to deliver goods and services to consumers at home.\n\nGoogle was late to the market with its smart speaker, which it started selling in the U.S. in November 2016, more than a year after Amazon's Echo became widely available in the U.S. The Echo could be a \"mega-hit\" and deliver $10 billion in revenue by 2020, according to RBC Capital Markets. But with this new feature, Google is offering users something the e-commerce giant doesn't — a way to find merchandise at your local store and try before you buy.\n\nGoogle also announced that it will soon let consumers tell its Assistant to create a shopping list and place items in a virtual cart that will sync across multiple devices.\n\n\n\n\"This cart will give shoppers the ability to buy multiple items from multiple merchants all in one transaction through the Assistant,\" said Alferness. \"For retailers, this means larger basket sizes and better margins.\"\n\nIt's all part of Google's long-term strategy to develop products and services that use artificial intelligence to make it easier for people to interact with computers and complete everyday tasks, he said. That, in turn, will feed into Google's ad-based business model.\n\n\n\n\"The better that we can satisfy users' needs, the better off we'll be,\" said Alferness. \"The more you are going to want to use the Assistant, the more you will use our services as well.\"", "Google is the largest, most-used search engine in the world, with a global market share that has held steady at about 90 percent since Google Search launched in 1997 as Backrub. In 2017, Google became the most valuable brand in the world, topping Apple, according to the Brand Finance Global 500 report. Google’s position is due mainly to its core business as a search engine and its ability to transform users into payers via advertising.\n\nAbout 32 percent of Google visitors come from the US, where the company holds 63.9 percent of the search engine market, according to statista.com. Google had 247 million unique US users in November 2015. Globally, it boasts 1.5 billion search engine users and more than 1 billion users of Gmail.\n\nGoogle data centers process an average of 40 million searches per second, resulting in 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year, Internet Live Stats reports. That’s up from 795.2 million searcher per year in 1999, one year after Google was launched.\n\nWork in the data center industry or simply curious about what the Internet is made of?

Since then, several projects have been canceled or scaled back, including the halt of further rollout of Google Fiber. Following the reorg, however, Google has placed a lot of focus (and dedicated a lot of resources) to selling cloud services to enterprises, going head-to-head against the market giant Amazon Web Services and the second-largest player in the space, Microsoft Azure.\n\nThat has meant a major expansion of Google data centers specifically to support those cloud services. At the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco in March 2017, the company’s execs revealed that it spent nearly $30 billion on data centers over the preceding three years. While the company already has what is probably the world’s largest cloud, it was not built to support enterprise cloud services. To do that, the company needs to have data centers in more locations, and that’s what it has been doing, adding new locations to support cloud services and adding cloud data center capacity wherever it makes sense in existing locations.\n\nThe largest of several murals illustrator Fuchsia MacAree painted on the walls of Google’s data center in Dublin (Photo: Google)\n\nHere are some of the most frequently asked questions about Google data centers and our best stab at answering them:\n\nWhere are Google Data Centers Located?\n\nGoogle lists eight data center locations in the U.S., one in South America, four in Europe and two in Asia. Its cloud sites, however, are expanding, and Google’s cloud map shows many points of presence worldwide. The company also has many caching sites in colocation facilities throughout the world, whose locations it does not share.\n\nThis far-flung network is necessary not only to support operations than run 24/7, but to meet specific regulations (like the EU’s privacy regulations) of certain regions and to ensure business continuity in the face of risks like natural disasters.\n\nIn the works as of March 2017, are Google data centers for cloud services in California, Canada, The Netherlands, Northern Virginia, São Paulo, London, Finland, Frankfurt, Mumbai, Singapore, and Sydney.\n\nHere are the data center sites listed by Google:\n\nNorth America:\n\nSouth America\n\nAsia\n\nEurope\n\nHow Big are Google Data Centers?\n\nA paper presented during the IEEE 802.3bs Task Force in May 2014 estimates the size of five of Google’s US facilities as:\n\nPryor Creek (Mayes County), Oklahoma , 980,000 square feet\n\nLenoir, North Carolina, 337,000 square feet\n\nThe Dalles, Oregon, 200,000 square feet (before the 2016, 164,000 square foot expansion)\n\nCouncil Bluff, Iowa, 200,000 square feet\n\nBerkely County, South Carolina, 200,000 square feet.\n\nMany of these sites have multiple data center buildings, as Google prefers to build additional structures as sites expand rather than containing operations in a single massive building.\n\nGoogle itself doesn’t disclose the size of its data centers. Instead, it mentions the cost of the sites or number of employees. Sometimes, facility size slips out. For example, the announcement about the opening of The Dalles in Oregon said the initial building was 164,000 square feet. The size of subsequent expansions, however, has been kept tightly under wraps.\n\nReports discussing Google’s new data center in Emeshaven, Netherlands, which opened December 2016, didn’t mention size. Instead, they said the company has contracted for the entire 62 Megawatt output of a nearby windfarm and ran 9,941 miles of computer cable within the facility. The data center employs 150 people.\n\nHow Many Servers Does Google Have?\n\nThere’s no official data on how many servers there are in Google data centers, but Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers. This number, of course, is always changing as the company expands capacity and refreshes its hardware.\n\n1 | 2 | 3", "For most of us, Saturday morning is a time for a lie in, a leisurely brunch, or maybe taking the kids to the park.

All that does is cause fear, uncertainty and +ego — stits (@stits) March 25, 2017\n\nIt seems a fair few people don't understand the rules of responsible disclosure. Researchers are perfectly free to go public by saying there is a flaw in a particular piece of code, so long as they don't say exactly what it is or how to exploit it before a patch is available.\n\nThere are some who suggest researchers shouldn't even highlight that a flaw exists. That ends up being counterproductive, since it reduces the incentive for manufacturers to fix their code. Companies might be fine with that, but it can put users at risk.\n\nGoogle and others have 90-day disclosure rules for just this reason – the thinking is that if a company can't be bothered to sort out an issue in that time then they aren't really trying – although almost every researcher will give a manufacturer more time if needed. It seems some people have forgotten this. ®", "The surge in customers to Papa's Fish and Chips in Willerby for a 1p meal offer has triggered an alert on Google.\n\nThe search engine picked up on the hundreds of customers heading for the bargain meal using its tracking software.\n\nThousands of 1p fish and chip meals have been sold by Papa's today at its two site in Willerby and at Bilton to celebrate being named one of Britain's best chip shops on TV.\n\nFamilies, school pupils and pensioners were among those willing to wait in queues more than an hour long for the offer.\n\nAt Willerby Hull FC players Mahe Fonua and Jansin Turgut were serving up fish and chips after owner Dino Papas spotted the players in the queue and asked if they'd like to help.\n\nWatch Hull FC players serving at Papa's\n\nThe Google alert is triggered by the number of people visiting a place at one time.

And last year, one tech company, Alphabet’s Google, published papers in all of them.\n\nThe unprecedented run of scientific results by the Mountain View search giant touched on everything from ophthalmology to computer games to neuroscience and climate models. For Google, 2016 was an annus mirabilis during which its researchers cracked the top journals and set records for sheer volume.\n\nBehind the surge is Google’s growing investment in artificial intelligence, particularly “deep learning,” a technique whose ability to make sense of images and other data is enhancing services like search and translation (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2013: Deep Learning”).\n\nAccording to the tally Google provided to MIT Technology Review, it published 218 journal or conference papers on machine learning in 2016, nearly twice as many as it did two years ago.\n\nWe sought out similar data from the Web of Science, a service of Clarivate Analytics, which confirmed the upsurge. Clarivate said that the impact of Google’s publications, according to a measure of publication strength it uses, was four to five times the world average. Compared to all companies that publish prolifically on artificial intelligence, Clarivate ranks Google No. 1 by a wide margin.\n\nTop rank\n\nThe publication explosion is no accident. Google has more than tripled the number of machine learning researchers working for the company over the last few years, according to Yoshua Bengio, a deep-learning specialist at the University of Montreal. “They have recruited like crazy,” he says.\n\nAnd to capture the first-round picks from computation labs, companies can’t only offer a Silicon Valley-sized salary. “It’s hard to hire people just for money,” says Konrad Kording, a computational neuroscientist at Northwestern University. “The top people care about advancing the world, and that means writing papers the world can use, and writing code the world can use.”\n\nAt Google, the scientific charge has been spearheaded by DeepMind, the high-concept British AI company started by neuroscientist and programmer Demis Hassabis. Google acquired it for $400 million in 2014.\n\nHassabis has left no doubt that he’s holding onto his scientific ambitions. In a January blog post, he said DeepMind has a “hybrid culture” between the long-term thinking of an academic department and “the speed and focus of the best startups.” Aligning with academic goals is “important to us personally,” he writes. Kording, one of whose post-doctoral students, Mohammad Azar, was recently hired by DeepMind, says that “it’s perfectly understood that the bulk of the projects advance science.”", "Israel's communications minister says the Bible is enough to prove that his country has legitimate land claims, despite what Google or Wikipedia say.

The ATO expects liabilities to total more than $2 billion from these seven companies.\n\nOxfam Australia spokeswoman Joy Kyriacou welcomed the passing of the DPT laws, but said more needed to be done to stop about $6 billion of offshoring of profits by Australian-based multinationals.\n\nShe said the government needs to ensure country-by-country reporting of tax affairs for all big businesses happens and is made public.\n\n\"Australian Tax Office data shows more than one in three big companies are paying no tax,\" she said.\n\n\"Big companies operating from Australia should be required to be transparent and publicly report on their profits, taxes and assets for every country in which they operate, so it's harder for them to shift profits and dodge paying their fair share.\"\n\nFollow Nassim Khadem on Facebook and Twitter.", "", "Earlier this week, Android co-founder Andy Rubin posted a picture teasing the first smartphone from his new company, Essential. At the time, we speculated that the bezel-less device would be running Android, but now it’s been confirmed — in a tweet from Alphabet's executive chairman Eric Schmidt, of all people. The whole thing is made even odder by the fact that Schmidt is tweeting about what could be a major Samsung competitor on the day of Samsung’s big S8 unveiling.\n\nPhenomenal new choices for Android users coming very soon.

But given Essential’s ambitions of creating a high-end smartphone meant to compete with the likes of Apple and Samsung, the fact that it will run Android means that it’ll be competing in an increasingly crowded marketplace that includes the just announced Galaxy S8 and Google’s own Pixel.", "Google has built a $580 billion empire by keeping its innovation engine running ahead of the competition. But on Wednesday the company pulled off an impressive, and curious, feat: It wowed the public with an eight-year-old idea.\n\nGoogle unveiled a new set of features for its popular Maps app that lets users share their locations with friends and contacts in real time. Thanks to this update, Google Maps users will now be able to quickly let friends know if they're running late to a meeting or stuck in traffic.\n\nIt's a compelling idea. And if you're wondering why Google hadn't thought of this earlier, the answer is: It did.\n\nIn 2009, when smartphones were still in their infancy, Google introduced something called Latitude.\n\nThe Latitude app, to quote Google's blog post announcing it, \"allows you to share your location with your friends and to see their approximate locations, if they choose to share them with you.\" In other words, it's almost the exact same feature Google is now touting as the hot new thing.\n\nTake a look at the two side by side.\n\nHere is Google Latitude, circa 2009:\n\nAnd here is a screenshot of the new Google Maps location-sharing feature:\n\nThe interfaces look almost identical, even though technology has changed dramatically in the past eight years. (The initial version of Google Latitude was for BlackBerry phones.)\n\nAt the time Latitude was launched, the app drew widespread privacy concerns. Privacy International, a European watchdog group, published a report highlighting the risk that users might not be aware Latitude was enabled and could thus track their whereabouts. A Google spokeswoman told Computerworld at the time that the company took user feedback about privacy seriously and was adding notifications to alert users when Latitude was turned on.\n\nHello again\n\nEight years later, the privacy concerns haven't gone away, but by and large, the outcry has been a footnote to the story. Instead, most of the coverage has focused on the benefits of sharing locations — for example, allowing parents to keep track of their smartphone-toting children — not fear-mongering about how it could go wrong.\n\nThe world has changed since 2009 when Google first tried this. Two billion people are on Facebook's social network. Millions of people wear bracelets that record their physical activity. The new hot gadget du jour is an eavesdropping microphone-speaker device with an innocent name like Alexa that consumers voluntarily put in their kitchens to get quick weather updates and sports scores.\n\nIt's not the first time we've seen a once controversial tech product resurface in new packaging a few years later to a much warmer reception. Just look at how much cooler people think Snap's video-recording sunglasses are now, only a few years after Google Glass.\n\nThe Google Maps location-sharing comeback is a good reminder of how quickly technology moves and how fluid our seemingly deeply rooted societal norms might be.\n\nMore importantly, it's a good time to reflect and take stock of what we give up (and what we gain) every time we embrace the latest life-changing tech toys and services.", "Photo: RiverNorthPhotography/Getty Images\n\nStarting in June, Google is saying good-bye to one of its most beloved products, Gchat. Officially, the chat app’s name was Google Talk; Gchat was just what hip, personal-computer owners started calling it back in the day, but the name has persisted. While the functionality of Gchat isn’t really going away — users will be rolled over to Hangouts, a Google chat platform that has been up and running for four years at this point and does effectively the same thing — the name and user interface will be no more.\n\n\n\nGchat’s run as the king of adult instant-messaging started back in 2005. For those of us just getting into the web around then, it was a perfect platform: Your tech-inept parents weren’t on it yet. It was cleaner and easier to use than AIM. And there was the added bonus that because it was new — Gmail launched in 2004, a year prior to Gchat — you might actually be able to snag a variation on your name, if not your given name exactly. Realistically, you probably went with something much cooler and more true to your inner spirit, like “flypegasusfly,” “crewgirl16,” or “mormonboy12804.” (I wish I could say I made any of those up.)\n\nSure, when the Google Hangouts switch happens in June, your online interactions aren’t really going to change that much. But the name will die, and that’s something to grieve on this slow-for-tech-news Friday. To Gchat with somebody was to enter a secret sanctum, one with an off-the-record-mode-induced cone of silence, which erased messages after you sent them. Giving somebody your personal Gmail account to message was an offering of friendship, an invitation to gossip freely away from the potentially prying eyes of company-owned Slack channels and Campfire rooms. If somebody wanted to Gchat, you knew to expect some good dish about your boss, or your ex, or your boss’s ex.\n\nIn addition to Google Hangouts, Google still offers a handful of other communication apps, including Allo, Duo, and its Android messaging app. Still, none of those have quite the same ring as “take this to Gchat.”", "1:32 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF\n\nWhile Google Home can do a lot that the Echo can't -- like contextual conversations or throwing images and videos to your televisions -- it has plenty of catching-up to do with Amazon Echo's Alexa. Google is always adding new features to Home, so that list continues to shrink, but there are still seven things we wish it could do.\n\nOne technical note: Throughout this piece, Google Assistant is often compared to Amazon Alexa, as those are the voice-assistance technologies within these devices. Just remember that the way Google Assistant works on Google Home is much more limited than the way it works on phones.\n\nTrack packages\n\nSince you can order items using Alexa, it only makes sense that you can track orders placed through Amazon with Alexa, as well. All you have to say is, \"Alexa, where's my stuff?\" She won't give you a ton of details, like where the package currently is or the status of the shipment, but she will tell you the day it's estimated to arrive.\n\nSeeing as this is a feature already integrated into Google Assistant on phones, it's likely only a matter of time before Google Home can also track orders placed with practically any online retailer. But there is no mention of package tracking in the long list of features of Google Home.\n\nIf you ask Google Home to track your package today, she'll just say, \"I can't do that yet.\" Yet!\n\nAmazon Music and Prime Music\n\nChris Monroe/CNET\n\nThe music and radio services officially supported by Google Home at launch were Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Spotify, Pandora and TuneIn. Support for iHeartRadio was rolled out at the end of February.\n\nWith Amazon's Alexa speakers, you get support for the same music services, save for Google Play Music and YouTube Music. Instead, you get support for Amazon's in-house streaming services, Amazon Music and Prime Music.\n\nDespite not officially supporting Amazon Music or Prime Music -- which isn't all that surprising given they are competitors -- you can stream almost any audio to Google Home by casting from a phone or tablet. The Amazon Music app does not support Chromecast, however, so you can't stream audio from the app to Google Home using an iOS device. However, there is a workaround for Android devices. Begin playing music from within the Amazon Music app, pull down the notification shade, tap the Cast logo, and select your Google Home from the list to stream the audio through the speaker.\n\nRead books out loud\n\nOne of Alexa's greatest features is the ability to play audiobooks from Audible or read your Kindle books, simply by asking. Say, \"Alexa, play 'A Walk in the Woods'\" or \"Alexa, read 'Ready Player One.'\"\n\nGoogle Home doesn't come with any official support for playing audiobooks or reading e-books (not surprising considering the companies are competitors), which is unfortunate and surprising, especially considering the built-in Read Aloud feature in Google Play Books.\n\nOf course, while you can't queue up an audiobook or have Google Home read an e-book with a voice command, you can use the same workaround mentioned above to stream the audio through the Google Home speaker. Play the audiobook or select Read Aloud in the Google Play Books app, pull down the notification shade, tap the Cast icon and select your Google Home speaker to begin streaming the audio. Still, this doesn't work with Kindle books. You will have had to have purchased the book from Google to stream the Read Aloud feature to Google Home, which might fragment your digital library.\n\nMultiple designs\n\nUnless you have an Android phone that supports Google Assistant, Google Home is the only way you can bring Assistant into your household.\n\nChris Monroe/CNET\n\nSince the launch of Echo, Amazon has added smaller and more portable options to its lineup. The Echo Dot is a cheaper, low-profile way to add more Alexa to your house; the Tap lets you take Alexa on the go -- no wires needed.\n\nAs mentioned, we suspect Google will allow other speaker-makers build Assistant into their devices. But until one hits the market, Amazon has the advantage when it comes to giving you multiple design options.\n\nVoice remote\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nIf you just want to be able to control your Echo from out of typical voice range, all you need is an Alexa Voice Remote for $30.\n\nTo accomplish the same thing with Google Home, you will need to add a second Google Home for $129 a pop (currently only available in the US, that directly converts to about £106, AU$171).\n\nThird-party apps\n\nCNET\n\nAmazon lets developers harness the power of Alexa within applications, such as Roger and Ubi. One developer created an online tool -- called Echosim.io -- so developers can test their skills without needing to own the hardware. As a plus, now anyone can take Alexa for a test drive in their browser.\n\nAside from streaming audio, these virtual versions of Alexa work exactly the same as the official devices from Amazon, meaning you can get the full effect of Alexa before ever having to spend a dime on Amazon's speakers. For now, the best way to test Google Home is by using Google Assistant on a compatible Android phone.\n\nDIY Alexa\n\nIn March of 2016, Amazon released an API for Alexa Voice Service (AVS), the service which powers the Amazon Echo, Echo Dot and Amazon Tap. This allowed developers and users to put Alexa on custom hardware, like Raspberry Pi. It also allows third-party manufacturers to build their own Alexa speakers (or Alexa-powered computers.)\n\nSo, if you don't like Amazon's speakers, there are third-party or homebrew options to choose from, like the Matrix Creator, an add-on board for Raspberry Pi.\n\nEditors' note: This article was updated March 13, 2017 to update information regarding new Google Home features and Google Assistant availability. Previously included in this list were Alexa skills, voice shopping and official iHeartRadio support. The ability for Alexa to read Kindle books was also added.", "Vox Media CEO: Google is going to be just fine Thursday, 23 Mar 2017 | 1:35 PM ET | 01:56\n\nAlphabet's had a tough week, with a number of agencies pulling advertisements from the platform due to fears about what content their ads could be placed next to.\n\nBut don't worry about Google or YouTube, said Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff on CNBC's \"Power Lunch.\"\n\n\"Google's going to be just fine and YouTube is enormously popular,\" said Bankoff. Still, advertisers are more closely scrutinizing the content their ads are appearing next to, Bankoff told CNBC.\n\nThis week AT&T, Verizon and Johnson & Johnson — some the biggest advertisers in the U.S. — were among a number of companies that pulled hundreds of millions of dollars from Google and YouTube, amid concerns their brands appeared alongside offensive content promoting terrorism and hate.\n\nSo far, Wall Street seems to agree with Bankoff. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney noted Thursday that the firm would not change its current estimates for the company's ad revenue.\n\nFacebook would be the likely beneficiary if there was a drop in interest in YouTube ads, wrote Mahaney. A recent RBC/AdAge survey showed just how strong advertiser interest in social, mobile and video ads has been, he wrote.\n\nAn estimated 20 percent of digital ad dollars are wasted on ads that are either never seen or do not properly load, said Bankoff. This issue, known as ad fraud, is another concern for advertisers.", "This navigation is new. We'd appreciate your feedback.

Or at least, not the featured snippets that Google puts at the top of search results.\n\nThe answers Google gives in featured snippets are sometimes \"terribly wrong,\" says Search Engine Land founding editor Danny Sullivan. (Photo: Josh Edelson, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe featured snippets are one of the 10 top search results Google displays in a special box. And they are in the spotlight thanks to longtime Google observer Danny Sullivan, founding editor of the blog Search Engine Land. Sullivan says the snippets, which he has dubbed Google's \"one true answer\" feature, can be deeply flawed. How flawed? \"Sometimes these answers are terribly wrong,\" Sullivan says.\n\nRecent examples? One featured snippet claimed some U.S. presidents were members of the Ku Klux Klan. (False). Another claimed President Obama was planning a coup d'etat. (Only if you scrolled down did you stumble on an ABC news story debunking the snippet).\n\nGoogle isn't even telling you the truth about how long it takes to caramelize onions (\"28 minutes if you cooked them as hot as possible and constantly stirred them, 45 minutes if you were sane about it\" but definitely not about five minutes), according to Gizmodo writer Tom Scocca. Or on whether MSG can kill you. (We're pretty sure it can't, at least we hope not).\n\n\"The featured snippets feature is an automatic and algorithmic match to the search query, and the content comes from third-party sites,\" Google said in an emailed statement. \"We’re always working to improve our algorithms, and we welcome feedback on incorrect information.\"\n\nUsers can report incorrect information through a \"Feedback\" button at the bottom right of the featured snippet, Google said.\n\nA screenshot of a Google snippet, the featured search result from a Google query. (Photo: Google for USA TODAY)\n\n\"Many of Google’s direct answers are correct. Ask Google if vaccines cause autism, and it will tell you they do not. Ask it if jet fuel melts steel beams, and it will pull an answer from a Popular Mechanics article debunking the famous 9/11 conspiracy theory,\" reports web magazine The Outline. \"But it’s easy to find examples of Google grabbing quick answers from shady places.\"\n\nOne more.

About 15% of searches return a featured snippet, according to MozCast, a website that tracks the Google algorithm.\n\nAnd, as Sullivan points out, featured snippets have been returning some pretty wacky answers for a couple of years now. It's a problem that will only get worse as people become more and more dependent on voice-activated assistants such as Google Home to fetch quick answers.\n\nI know @ruskin147 already shared this, but here's my own Google Home informing me Obama plans a coup. pic.twitter.com/gs0s0ivF3L — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) March 5, 2017\n\nThe featured snippets problem comes as Google and Facebook are taking heat for doing too little to curb fake news during the presidential election.\n\nSo what does Sullivan recommend?\n\n\"The easy solution would be for Google to stop using featured snippets,\" he says. \"That doesn’t mean that Google wouldn’t come under criticism for bad results. After all, featured snippets come from one of the 10 web listings that are presented. One or more of those listings might still be problematic. But at least a problematic result wouldn’t get elevated to such exalted status, subjecting Google to greater criticism.\"\n\nUnfortunately that would undercut Google as it battles with Apple and Amazon for dominance in the next wave of search, voice-activated assistants, so a non-starter.\n\nBut wait, what's the answer?\n\n\"In the end, I don’t know that there’s a perfect answer,\" Sullivan says. \"But Google clearly needs to do something.\"\n\nGood news for folks who don't want to play Russian roulette with featured snippets: You can opt out of them.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ncxF9S", "The Google-funded startup Calico , as with many of the tech-originating firms foraying into the life sciences, has a lofty goal: to tackle the spectrum of \"aging-related\" diseases, which encompasses everything from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's to cancer. While the outfit is notoriously cagey about its work, it's certainly not shy about striking up partnerships.\n\nThe latest one came on Thursday afternoon, when the biotech C4 Therapeutics announced a five-year research collaboration with Calico to develop drugs for \"diseases of aging,\" including cancer.\n\nThere's not a whole lot in the way of details. The firms will \"leverage C4T’s expertise and capabilities in targeted protein degradation to jointly discover and advance small molecule protein degraders as therapeutic agents to remove certain disease-causing proteins,\" according to a press release. In simpler terms, the firms wants to create medicines to sniff out proteins that may help cause cancers and destroy them.\n\n\"We know from decades of translational research that it can be incredibly challenging to find effective pharmacologic inhibitors of many of the biologically well-validated targets, particularly in cancer,\" said Hal Barron, R&D chief over at Calico, in a statement. \"Through the alternative strategy of specifically targeting such proteins for degradation, we believe we have the opportunity to identify promising new therapeutics in cancer and in other diseases as well.\"\n\nBeyond that, we know very little, including what other disease targets or specific cancers will be Calico's and C4T's focus as they pursue preclinical experimental molecules.

The researchers found that cities with older gas pipelines leaked about 25 times more gas and argue in a study published today in Environmental Science and Technology that the cars could be a fast and inexpensive tool for tracking down leaks.", "Google Assistant, the brains behind the Google Home speaker and the virtual assistant found on Android phones and watches and within Allo, is oddly fragmented. Unlike Alexa, which works virtually the same whether you're accessing it from an official device, third-party hardware, a DIY Alexa speaker or even the Amazon app on an iOS, Google Assistant's feature list varies based on how or with which device you use it.\n\nSomething you can do with Google Home, you might not be able to do with Assistant on your Android device. Here is how Assistant is different in all the places it's available.\n\nWhat Google Assistant can do everywhere\n\nDespite its varying list of features, Google Assistant is capable of quite a lot, regardless of how you're tapping into it.

And for what it's worth, some of these shortcomings can be fixed with simple IFTTT applets which were oddly created by Google itself.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is that Assistant will identify songs that are currently playing on that specific device, but not by listening Shazam style.

Turned out it was a fraud attempt and whoever was behind it had created a fake passport to use as ID.\n\nPolice did a Google image search for the real bank account owner and discovered the fake passport photo used by the fraudster, which was not of the real victim but of someone with the same name.

That’s how Twitter Executive Chairman Omid Kordestani, like many immigrants, found his way from Iran to Silicon Valley as a teenager.\n\nThe move was unexpected. So was his father’s death from cancer, a moment of grief that left his family with a decision about where to go next. And as luck would have it, Kordestani followed family friends to the United States in the 1970s just as turmoil broke out in Iran.\n\n“My immigration was total serendipity,” he said in an interview at Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters.\n\nOmid Kordestani Age: 53 Career: After college, worked at Hewlett-Packard in marketing. Joined Google as employee No. 11 in 1999, became chief business officer in 2014. Named executive chairman of Twitter in 2015. Education: B.S. in electrical engineering, San Jose State University; MBA, Stanford Compensation at Twitter: $12.4 million (2015) Source: San Jose Mercury News, company filings\n\nKordestani’s trials as an immigrant and his success in Silicon Valley help illustrate why the tech industry has reacted so strongly to President Donald Trump’s travel ban. Immigrants have founded companies, served as executives and helped create the technology of the future.\n\nAn immigrant’s journey to a new country is rarely as simple as following a relative or friend. But Kordestani’s challenges also shaped his success in Silicon Valley, including more than a decade at Google, where he joined the tech firm as employee No. 11 and led the company’s global business operations.\n\nHe once told a graduating class at San Jose State University — his alma mater — to “think and act like an immigrant.”\n\n“What I mean by that immigrant attitude is that you’ve got to continually fight, challenge yourself,” said Kordestani, who is now a U.S. citizen. “You’ve got to make yourself uncomfortable so you grow from that.”\n\nAt 53 years old, he’s still tackling new challenges at Twitter, a tech firm that raked in $2.5 billion in revenue in 2016, but posted a loss of $457 million. Trump’s tweeting has raised Twitter’s profile around the world, yet the company still struggles to compete for ad dollars amid layoffs and executive departures.\n\nTrump’s recently revised executive order, though blocked in court, continues to bring more attention to how immigration fueled Silicon Valley’s growth. It’s also placed more pressure on Twitter’s leaders, who have faced calls from critics to bar the president from the social network for what they deem as hate speech and misinformation.\n\nWhile Kordestani opposes the travel ban, he’s also an optimist who firmly believes in the power of dialogue that Twitter enables.\n\n“Achieving the success he has achieved has allowed him to have a very optimistic view of the world — that hard work and persistence will pay off in the end — and he brings that to every meeting and challenge,” said Vijaya Gadde, Twitter’s general counsel.\n\nWhen Kordestani reflects on his childhood in Tehran, Iran, he describes a metropolis filled with different cultures and religions living together in harmony.\n\nHis mom was a nurse. His dad, an engineer, built a three-story apartment that the middle-class family called home. Americans lived on one floor. Israelis lived on another. His dance instructor was Armenian.\n\nAttending Andisheh Don Bosco School, an Italian Catholic school in Tehran, Kordestani studied in English and Farsi.\n\nBut when his father died, Kordestani knew there would be more opportunities to study engineering outside of Iran. Getting admitted into a university in Iran is highly competitive, and there are only a limited number of spots for students.\n\nAt 14 years old, Kordestani envisioned life in America would be like the sitcom “The Jeffersons.” The country was filled with opportunity, as conveyed by the show’s “Movin’ On Up” theme song.\n\n“It was an African-American family living in Manhattan,” Kordestani said. “It just seemed like this incredible dazzling city to me, and I imagined the entire United States looked like that.”\n\nTwo choices were on the table: San Jose, where his father’s boss had sons attending school, or Fort Worth, Texas.\n\n“I think California has better weather. We should go there,” his mom said.\n\nIn 1978, Kordestani, his younger brother and mom packed their bags for San Jose. The harmonious Iran of his youth soon became a distant memory.\n\nMonths later, protests in Iran led to the overthrow of its U.S.-backed monarch. Then, in November 1979, supporters of the Iranian Revolution stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took more than 50 Americans hostage for 444 days.\n\nIran’s political upheaval hit the Kordestanis financially, making their funds inaccessible over the years. Like other immigrants, the family focused on education and hard work.\n\nAt Buchser High School in Santa Clara, Kordestani said, talking to his classmates helped reduce tensions fueled on campus by the Iran hostage crisis.\n\nAn Italian-American history teacher, who was concerned about Kordestani, drove the student to and from school and called on him during class.\n\n“It just became this live political discourse and discussion, and he kept referring to me to talk about what’s going on in the region,” Kordestani said, noting it mirrors what’s happening on Twitter today.\n\nIn 1980, Kordestani graduated from high school and had some final words for his classmates.\n\n“I hope one day the leaders of the world realize the value of friendship and establish this feeling among themselves, the way I did with my American friends here at Buchser High,” he wrote.\n\nAfter graduating from San Jose State University in 1984 with a degree in electrical and electronics engineering, Kordestani took a job at Hewlett-Packard as a product marketing manager.\n\nAround that time, he also became a naturalized U.S. citizen. That allowed him to bring back his mom, who had left the country because she didn’t have a green card.\n\nAfter five years at HP, Kordestani wanted another challenge, so he earned a master’s degree in business administration from Stanford University and went on to work for a number of Silicon Valley startups.\n\nHe joined Google in 1999, and employees who worked with him said he instilled confidence during the company’s rapid growth.\n\nBut at the peak of Kordestani’s career success, fame and fortune at Google, he also found himself in the office of a psychologist in San Francisco, going through a divorce with his wife Bita Daryabari and questioning if he should be happy with all he accomplished.\n\nIn 2008, Forbes valued Kordestani’s net worth at $2.2 billion. After his divorce, Forbes assessed his net worth in 2009 at $1.4 billion.\n\nSpeaking in 2009 at a leadership conference at UCLA, organized by two Iranian-American groups, Kordestani said that “life is messy,” but urged the audience not to be afraid of failure. When life surprises you, he told the crowd, checklists and the Persian life manual go out the window.\n\nIn 2011, Kordestani, who has two older children with Daryabari, married again. Gisel Kordestani used to work at Google and is the co-founder and chief operating officer of political fundraising site Crowdpac.\n\nOn an alumni wall of honor filled with black and gold plaques at San Jose State University, an etching of a smiling Kordestani stands out among other notable engineering graduates.\n\nWhen university students pack that room to receive scholarships, Belle Wei, professor and former dean of the college of engineering, often points to Kordestani’s plaque as she encourages them to follow their own dreams.\n\n“If you work hard, you’re in the right place and doing the right thing,” she tells the students, “then one day you can be like Omid.”", "A federal judge in San Francisco on Wednesday slammed a legal settlement that proposed to pay $2.2 million to lawyers, but nothing to consumers who had the contents of their email scanned by Google without their knowledge or permission.\n\nIn a 6-page order , Judge Lucy Koh told Google ( goog ) and class action attorneys the proposed settlement was insufficient, in part because it failed to clearly tell consumers what the search giant had done.\n\n\"This notice is difficult to understand and does not clearly disclose the fact that Google intercepts, scans and analyzes the content of emails sent by non-Gmail users to Gmail users for the purpose of creating user profiles of the Gmail users to create targeted advertising for the Gmail users,\" Koh wrote.\n\nThe case is the latest twist in a long-running legal fight over whether Google's email scanning practices amount to illegal wiretaps and a violation of California privacy laws. Even though this scanning is automated—and doesn't amount to Google employees poking around emails—critics say the practice is akin to AT&T listening in on people's phone calls or the United States Postal Service reading personal letters.\n\nGoogle won a related lawsuit several years ago involving Gmail users who had signed up for the the service. The 2015 case is different, however, because it involves people who use other email providers—such as Microsoft ( msft ) or Yahoo ( yhoo ) —but whose messages are scanned without their permission when they send an email to a Gmail users.\n\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nAs part of the proposed settlement, Google agreed to change the way it scans incoming messages so that it no longer reads emails while they are in transit, but only when they are in someone's inbox. The change amounts to a technicality but the company and the class action lawyers agree it puts Google in the clear as far as wiretap laws.\n\nJudge Koh, however, said she's not so sure about that. Her ruling claims the settlement does not provide an adequate technical explanation of Google's workaround, which involves scanning in-transit emails for security purposes, and then later parsing them for advertising data.\n\n\"It does not disclose that Google will scan the email of non-Gmail users while the emails are in transit for the “dual purpose” of creating user profiles and targeted advertising and for detecting spam and malware,\" Koh wrote.\n\nThe judge also added that another settlement last year, involving Yahoo's scanning of emails, did not reflect the facts of the Google case.\n\nThe upshot is that Koh wants the case to proceed further and for the class action lawyers to push Google for recent documents about how the email scanning process really works. As the judge notes, the current settlement relies on documents that are three to six years old.\n\nAny future settlement will presumably also have to do more to inform email users about Google's scanning practices and, possibly, direct some of the settlement money to consumers instead of only the lawyers. Under the deal Koh rejected, Google would have paid $2.2 million to the attorneys, plus up to $140,000 in online ads to publicize the agreement.\n\nKoh's concerns reflect a sore point among many, including judges, who feel a long string of privacy settlements with big tech companies have done little to compensate consumers or improve privacy.\n\nGoogle declined to comment on the ruling.", "Updated Google's Chrome development team has posted a stinging criticism of Symantec's certificate-issuance practices, saying it has lost confidence in the company's practices and therefore in the safety of sessions hopefully-secured by Symantec-issued certificates.\n\nGoogle's post says “Since January 19, the Google Chrome team has been investigating a series of failures by Symantec Corporation to properly validate certificates. Over the course of this investigation, the explanations provided by Symantec have revealed a continually increasing scope of misissuance with each set of questions from members of the Google Chrome team; an initial set of reportedly 127 certificates has expanded to include at least 30,000 certificates, issued over a period spanning several years.”\n\nGoogler Ryan Sleevi unloads on Symantec as follows:\n\nSymantec allowed at least four parties access to their infrastructure in a way to cause certificate issuance, did not sufficiently oversee these capabilities as required and expected, and when presented with evidence of these organizations’ failure to abide to the appropriate standard of care, failed to disclose such information in a timely manner or to identify the significance of the issues reported to them. These issues, and the corresponding failure of appropriate oversight, spanned a period of several years, and were trivially identifiable from the information publicly available or that Symantec shared.\n\nThe post gets worse, for Symantec:\n\nThe full disclosure of these issues has taken more than a month. Symantec has failed to provide timely updates to the community regarding these issues. Despite having knowledge of these issues, Symantec has repeatedly failed to proactively disclose them. Further, even after issues have become public, Symantec failed to provide the information that the community required to assess the significance of these issues until they had been specifically questioned. The proposed remediation steps offered by Symantec have involved relying on known-problematic information or using practices insufficient to provide the level of assurance required under the Baseline Requirements and expected by the Chrome Root CA Policy.\n\nThe upshot is that Google feels it can “no longer have confidence in the certificate issuance policies and practices of Symantec over the past several years” and it therefore proposes three remedies:\n\nA reduction in the accepted validity period of newly issued Symantec-issued certificates to nine months or less, in order to minimize any impact to Google Chrome users from any further misissuances that may arise.\n\nAn incremental distrust, spanning a series of Google Chrome releases, of all currently-trusted Symantec-issued certificates, requiring they be revalidated and replaced.\n\nRemoval of recognition of the Extended Validation status of Symantec issued certificates, until such a time as the community can be assured in the policies and practices of Symantec, but no sooner than one year.\n\nWhat do we mean by Extended Validation? It's a little feature that allows the browser to confidently show the owner of a HTTPS-secured website next to the green padlock in the address bar. Google Chrome is going to stop showing that text string for Symantec-issued SSL/TLS certificates. In other words, websites that have paid Symantec for certs with Extended Validation won't see the feature in Chrome.\n\nA normal certificate without the Extended Validation string\n\nA certificate with its Extended Validation text shown in the browser\n\nAs for the \"reduction in the accepted validity period,\" that means various different versions of Chrome will stop trusting Symantec-issued certificates older than the times listed below. Once a Symantec-issued cert is older than the validity period listed, Chrome will stop trusting it, forcing the certificate's owner to renew it.\n\nChrome version Cert validity period Chrome 59 (Dev, Beta, Stable) 33 months (1023 days) Chrome 60 (Dev, Beta, Stable) 27 months (837 days) Chrome 61 (Dev, Beta, Stable) 21 months (651 days) Chrome 62 (Dev, Beta, Stable) 15 months (465 days) Chrome 63 (Dev, Beta) 9 months (279 days) Chrome 63 (Stable) 15 months (465 days) Chrome 64 (Dev, Beta, Stable) 9 months (279 days)\n\n\"We propose to require that all newly-issued certificates must have validity periods of no greater than 9 months (279 days) in order to be trusted in Google Chrome, effective Chrome 61,\" the search giant added.\n\n\"This ensures that the risk of any further misissuance is, at most, limited to nine months, and more importantly, that if any further action is warranted or necessary, that the entire ecosystem can migrate within that time period, thus minimizing the risk of further compatibility issues.\"\n\nGoogle reckons this plan will mean “web developers are aware of the risk and potential of future distrust of Symantec-issued certificates, should additional misissuance events occur, while also allowing them the flexibility to continue using such certificates should it be necessary.”\n\nAnd of course it also gives developers time to arrange new certificates from whatever issuer pleases them most. Symantec has told The Register it is developing a response to Google's allegations. We will add it to this story as soon as we receive it. ®\n\nUpdated to add\n\nSymantec has hit back at Google's claims, saying they are “exaggerated and misleading.”\n\n“We strongly object to the action Google has taken to target Symantec SSL/TLS certificates in the Chrome browser,” Symantec said in a blog post.\n\n“This action was unexpected, and we believe the blog post was irresponsible. We hope it was not calculated to create uncertainty and doubt within the Internet community about our SSL/TLS certificates.”\n\nThe company said that while yes, it had mis-issued 127 certificates, that 30,000 figure was “not true,” and no consumer harm had been done. It claims to operate “in accordance with industry standards,” and will defend its reputation. Symantec is now in discussions with Google to resolve the issue.", "So why don’t we all have fiber, and why is it treated as such a gift from our corporate gods when new areas finally get access? Above all else, fiber is terribly expensive to deploy. To get those gigabit speeds, providers need to dig trenches to run their own cables to each home, which means getting a lot of permits to dig those trenches. Both Google and AT&T are experimenting with ways to reduce these problems, like wireless fiber, which reduces the cost of bringing fiber directly to people’s homes (the so-called “last mile” problem).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, AT&T has something of an an advantage in all broadband deployment matters, thanks to the advantages of incumbency: notably, it has a head-start in both physical infrastructure (owning utility poles) and political clout. It’s also gone out of its way to make it harder for new providers to compete. In Nashville, for instance, AT&T sued the city over a Google-backed policy to speed up the process for deploying fiber to utility poles by allowing one contractor to make all necessary changes on a pole. Under the previous policy, each company had to send its own engineer to move its own wires, which is part of why Google was only able to deploy to 33 poles out of 88,000 by September last year. (That lawsuit is still ongoing.)\n\nWhen reached by email, a Google spokesperson declined to comment on AT&T’s new plans. When reporters ask Google about their fiber plans, the company insists that it’s still committed fiber, such as in Louisville, another city it announced it would expand into last year, and is merely changing how it deploys the service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSponsored\n\nThe main question with AT&T’s expansion plans, at least, is who these new build-outs will serve. This isn’t the first time AT&T has announced a big new expansion and come up short in terms of actually reaching new customers. There was no news in this announcement of whether AT&T would be expanding its fiber service in poor areas of Cleveland, for example, which are desperately underserved. Let’s hope the new service in places like New Orleans, with its staggering income inequality, isn’t as dramatically divided as it is in Cleveland.", "If you use Google's G Suite apps and Mozilla's Firefox browser, good news: The two are going to get along much better.\n\nThe G Suite tools for word processing, spreadsheets, Gmail and other chores have worked better on Google's Chrome than on rival browsers in one important way: You can open and edit documents even when you don't have a network connection. That offline support is handy when you're on a plane or train or otherwise disconnected.\n\nBut now -- a full six years after Google said it hoped to do so -- the company is revamping its G Suite tools so they work offline with other browsers, too, the company confirmed to CNET.\n\nTo expand the offline support, Google is rebuilding G Suite tools like Google Docs and Google Sheets with new technology called progressive web apps. Specifically web-app plumbing called Service Worker adds offline data-access features. Service Worker abilities are already built into Chrome and Firefox and are now being added to Microsoft's Edge browser.\n\nHundreds of millions of people use G Suite, and hundreds of millions of others use Firefox and Edge. Adding the offline support significantly helps those people -- and means it's harder to accuse Google of favoring its own browser. Websites that work in only one browser undermine the web's advantage as a universal foundation for computing, one that's not controlled by any single company.\n\n\"Google first prototyped offline support for the web ... nearly a decade ago, and it is great to see this capability coming to Firefox via modern standards,\" Mozilla said in a statement. \"We look forward to continuing to work with Google to ensure that Google web properties work great for millions of Firefox users.\"\n\nOffline G Suite apps have indeed been a very, very long time coming, at least by internet standards. Back in 2011, Google said it planned to extend offline support beyond Chrome. But the approach Chrome used -- technologies called IndexedDB and AppCache -- didn't work broadly enough for Google to move forward, the company said.\n\nBrowser makers' enthusiasm for the progressive web app technology makes things very different now, though, said Taylor Savage, the product manager on the Chrome team overseeing progressive web apps. \"Progressive web apps on Service Worker is like nothing we've seen before in terms of standardization and browser support,\" he said.\n\nGoogle is working on the new approach but wouldn't yet say when it expected the new offline support to arrive in G Suite or detail whether it would address other shortcomings, like the restriction that a particular document can be edited only in a single browser tab while offline.\n\nWhat about Safari users who want to work offline? Their fate isn't yet clear. Developers of WebKit, the open-source underpinnings of Apple's browser, only shows Service Worker support as \"under consideration.\"\n\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFirst published March 24, 5 a.m. PT.\n\nUpdate, 7:57 a.m. PT: Adds comment from Mozilla.", "In Brief Google Earth's Street View cars are being used for more than just maps: scientists have equipped them with pollution trackers so they can help spot natural gas leaks.\n\nThe Other Greenhouse Gas\n\nMost people are familiar with carbon dioxide (CO2) as a leading cause of global warming, but it isn’t the only one. Methane, while it doesn’t linger in the atmosphere as long as CO2 does, contributes its own fair share as a greenhouse gas. Methane is also more potent than CO2, and can remain in the atmosphere for roughly five years. Recent estimates put the amount of methane in the atmosphere at 1,834 parts per billion (ppb) while CO2 is at just 399.5 ppb.\n\nOne of the more common sources of methane is natural gas leaks. These leaks are now occurring at an increased rate, thanks to aging urban natural gas pipelines. In 2016, Los Angeles suffered the most disastrous natural gas leak in U.S. history when 100,000 tons of methane was released. Not only are these leaks hazardous for the environment, they also damage the natural gas industry. In Boston, for instance, about $90 million worth of natural gas is lost each year — roughly 3 percent of its supply.\n\nMore Than Just Maps\n\nA team led by researchers from the Colorado State University (CSU), the Environmental Defense Fund, and Google Earth Outreach came up with a creative way of monitoring these leaks. They detail their project in a study published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology.\n\nThe team added pollution trackers to Google Earth’s Street View cars. The tracker uses an infrared laser that act as a methane analyzer, capable of identifying methane fumes in real time. Previously, this could only be done in labs using a gas chromatography analysis.\n\n“The air contains gases that make it look foggy in the infrared spectrum,” explained Joe von Fischer from CSU. “The laser can scan through colors of infrared light and ‘see’ how much methane is present.” The researchers have tested the the device in Indianapolis, Boston, Staten Island, Syracuse, and Burlington, Vermont and Indianapolis.\n\n“This is a huge challenge that almost nobody had been thinking about. Now we’re finding out just how widespread these leaks are,” said von Fischer. “The faster you fix them, the bigger the environmental benefits are. But utilities and regulators didn’t have the data to focus their efforts. […] Our goal is to make it faster, cheaper and easier to find and measure methane leaks from natural gas lines to help accelerate crucial repairs.”", "Companies such as Verizon and AT&T have decided to pull ads from YouTube over extremist content in the video platform owned by Google. Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt and former Google Senior V.P. of Products Jonathan Rosenberg discuss how they are addressing the issue.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n“What we do is, we match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match. We’ve had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time and so I think we’re going to be okay,” Schmidt told the FOX Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo.\n\nRosenberg explained that as Google has grown as a company its focus has shifted so it can better address these kinds of issues.\n\n“What we’re focused on now is organizing around the CEOs who can have the kind of technical insights to build products that solve these kind of problems,” said Rosenberg.\n\nSchmidt explained that YouTube’s enormous growth has made it a big responsibility and challenge to manage.\n\n“YouTube for example went from about 100 million hours of watched per day, to one billion hours of YouTube watched globally per day, it’s an extraordinary platform and an extraordinary responsibility.”\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to Schmidt, it is possible for computers to solve the issue of dealing with extremist videos as well as fake news.\n\n“My own view on most of this sort of extremist things as well as fake news in general is that it’s essentially a ranking problem. We’re very good at detecting what’s the most relevant and what’s the least relevant. It should be possible for computers to detect malicious, misleading and incorrect information and essentially have you not see it.”\n\nThough Schmidt does not see this as censorship, saying, “We’re not arguing for censorship, we’re arguing just take it off the page, put it somewhere else.”\n\nBut Schmidt viewed it as a bigger issue with social media.\n\n“It’s a big problem in social media in my view, the social media thinks in terms of links, not ranking right? And there’s undifferentiated linkings, like I’m going to link to here and here and all of a sudden they’ve discovered they think that what they think is a woman who’s a passionate activist who’s in fact a computer right, run by the Russians or whatever stereotype you have.”", "Google’s share of the search ad market is supposed to grow to more than 80 percent by 2019, according to research firm eMarketer.\n\nWhile the company’s dominance of the search ad market is to be expected, its growing market share is bad news for competing companies, including Microsoft, Yelp and AOL.\n\nLast year, Google held 75.8 percent of the search ad market, bringing in $24.6 billion in revenue from search ads. That’s expected to grow to $36.62 billion in revenue, or 80.2 percent of the market, in 2019.\n\nThat all comes at the expense of Microsoft, Yelp and Verizon-owned AOL, which are expected to lose market share down to 6.6 percent, 5.8 percent and 1.1 percent of search ad spending, respectively.\n\nMonica Peart, an analyst with eMarketer, said in a statement that Google has mobile search to thank for the growth.\n\n“Google and mobile search as a whole will continue to benefit from this behavioral shift,” she said.", "Even worse was Google's first attempt at responding to press inquiries. The company had the audacity to say: \"This isn't an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales.\" To me, this means that any partner that wants to work with Google can show up in my living room. Being hassled by advertisers while using Home isn't a \"feature\" that Google has ever talked about before.\n\nThe backlash was swift; Google responded quickly. Within a few hours, Google had removed the ad from Home and issues a mild apology. Even then, though, it refused to call the message an ad. And lots of Home users are likely going to be suspicious that their device will start shilling products at any time, without warning.\n\nThe problem comes down to breaking user expectations. Google advertised a set of features and services for Home in exchange for your $130; integrated ads was not among them. It's different with a product like Amazon's Kindle readers, which display ads on the screen when the device is locked. Though Amazon uses the tricky phase \"with special offers\" to describe Kindles with ads, the product description is clear enough. And you can always pay a little more to get rid of those ads entirely.\n\nGoogle Home is different. The company has an email address for every single Home user -- if it wanted, it could have contacted them about a new \"partner messages\" program coming to the device. Even if you couldn't opt out, getting a heads up is the bare minimum I'd expect; that email wouldn't keep me from getting ticked off about the change, but at least I'd be aware of what was happening.\n\nTo some extent, I believe Google wants to find ways to extend the \"my day\" feature by including some timely info. Home has already given some info about the Oscars ahead of the show, and it also had a special Black History Month story in February. But those experiences are a lot different from a message that simply sounded like an ad, as much as Google claims that wasn't the intent.\n\nEven if we accept Google's line that it's just trying to find ways to enhance the \"my day\" feature, it should be a strictly opt-in feature. The Google Home app lets you customize exactly what you'll hear when you ask the device to tell you about your day. The lack of a checkbox or any other information for these \"partner messages\" makes Google's explanation ring hollow.\n\nGoogle's apology and quick action around the Beauty and the Beast ad at least kept me from giving up on Home entirely. But given how Google makes money, we should be prepared for something like this to happen again. Hopefully, Google has learned its lesson and won't invade Home users' ... homes without express permission. Personally, the only ads I'll tolerate on Google Home are from ad-supported services I might use with it -- not from the Google Assistant itself.", "Google managed to find $12 billion in new advertising revenue last year.

That’s what Google’s Gary Illyes repeated this week — at least three times — to SEOs and webmasters who might be concerned about the upcoming switch to a mobile-first index.\n\n“The team behind the mobile-first index wants it to launch this year,” Illyes told our SMX West conference on Wednesday. “We’re still experimenting. We don’t have a timeline. It could be a few months or quarters, but it’s definitely not weeks [away]. Don’t freak out, especially if you have a responsive site.”\n\nIllyes first revealed plans to create a separate mobile-first index back in October and said at the time that it was “months away” from becoming reality. Five months later, that’s still the case.\n\nThe change is prompted by the fact that, since 2015, more than half of all Google searches are happening on mobile devices. When the change happens, Google will use the mobile version of web content as its primary index and rank results based on that mobile content, even for desktop searchers.\n\nOne of the big challenges in making this switch is that the mobile web has fewer signals for Google to use.\n\n“The mobile web has fewer tokens than desktop. Content and links are more scarce,” Illyes said. “Mobile sites don’t have a lot of the metadata that desktop sites have. We’re aiming for a quality-neutral launch. We don’t want users to experience a loss in quality of search results. We need to replace the signals that are missing in the mobile web.”\n\nHe also explained that Google is working on a new page speed measurement process that’s specific to mobile sites, because using the desktop page speed measurement isn’t relevant.\n\nHe offered a brief to-do list for SEOs to prepare for the mobile-first index:\n\nMake sure your mobile site has the content you want to rank for. Make sure structured data are on your mobile site. Make sure rel-annotations are on your mobile site.\n\nIllyes said Google will provide more guidance on the last two points in the future.\n\nHis most important advice?\n\n“Don’t freak out.

MPs meanwhile threatened that legislation could be put on the table if social media companies did not effectively self-regulate.\n\nThe company has been forced to review its advertising policies after the UK government joined organisations including the Guardian, BBC and Transport for London in pulling advertising from Google and YouTube in response to the news. The company has also been summoned to the Cabinet Office.\n\nAn influential group of MPs from the home affairs select committee wrote to the company on Friday, accusing them of “profiting from hatred” just days after accusing Google, Twitter and Facebook of “commercial prostitution” because of a failure to tackle hate speech on their platforms.\n\nLabour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the HASC, said that despite reassurances during the committee hearing that the companies did not allow hate speech or terrorist content to be monetised, media reports had revealed “that this is not the case”.\n\n“Government advertisements and major brands advertising is still being placed on inappropriate and hate-filled sites,” she wrote. “As a result Google and these organisations are still profiting from hatred.”\n\nCooper called on Google to refund money to the government and other advertisers and explain “how this has happened, and what you are doing to prevent it ever happening again.”\n\nGoogle could face an embarrassing number of refund requests, which it is understood will be issued in the form of credits to advertisers if the company made an error placing an ad and concluded that the material was sufficiently offensive to terminate the account of the publisher.\n\nConservative MP Tim Loughton, who also sits on the committee, said if social media companies “would not do their own self-regulation, they will have to face proper regulation” – raising the prospect of more restrictive UK legislation being brought against internet giants. He supported a move in Germany which could see social media companies face fines of up to €50m (£44m) if they failed to delete offending material within a week. .\n\n“There is a real public appetite that would support those companies being brought to heel,” he said.\n\nLabour MP Chuka Umunna said: “It is wrong that these social media companies should make billions of dollars out of running their platforms but don’t make the necessary investments to properly police them.”\n\nMeanwhile Google was facing growing commercial pressure, with French advertising group Havas, whose clients include O2, EDF and Royal Mail, becoming the first of the major global marketing companies to pull all its advertising spending from its platforms.\n\nHavas, the world’s sixth largest marketing services group, spends about £175m on digital advertising on behalf of clients in the UK annually.\n\nThe firm said it had taken the step after talks with Google had broken down because the tech company had been “unable to provide specific reassurances, policy and guarantees that their video or display content is classified either quickly enough or with the correct filters.”\n\nSir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the world’s largest marketing services group WPP, was critical of Google, but fell short of blacklisting the company from its UK advertising schedule.\n\n“Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company,” said Sorrell. “They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements.”\n\nPublicis, the world’s third largest marketing group, said that it is reviewing its global relationship with Google and YouTube. The company, which has clients including Samsung, Coty and Mars, was highly critical of Google’s failures.\n\n“Publicis Media is committed to being at the forefront of rigorous brand safety, viewability and verification standards and protocols,” said a spokeswoman. “We hold all publishers, including Google and YouTube, accountable to ensure that the highest standards of advertising are consistently met.”\n\nIt is also understood that Tesco has joined the host of advertisers to “pause” spending on YouTube for the time being.\n\nIn face of the growing pressure Google promised it would conduct a “thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls”. Ronan Harris, managing director of Google UK, said the company would be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their adverts appeared.\n\n\n\nHarris said 400 hours of video was uploaded to YouTube every minute, adding that last year Google removed nearly 2 billion “bad ads” from its systems, removed over 100,000 publishers from its AdSense programme and prevented adverts from serving on over 300m YouTube videos.\n\n“We’ve heard from our advertisers and agencies loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content,” he said.\n\nThe controversy comes after a Times investigation revealed that adverts from government departments, Channel 4, the BBC, Argos, L’Oréal and others were placed next to YouTube videos of American white nationalists, a hate preacher banned in the UK and a controversial Islamist preacher.\n\nAds for the Guardian’s membership scheme are understood to have been placed alongside a range of extremist material after an agency acting on the media group’s behalf used Google’s AdX ad exchange, which uses programmatic trading. The Guardian withdrew its advertising from Google and YouTube in response.\n\nThe use of programmatic trading, which automates the process of buying and selling advertising online, is increasingly controversial, raising concerns that it both hurts media revenues and supports extremist material.\n\nA government spokeswoman said it had placed a temporary restriction on YouTube advertising pending assurance.

Born in Vietnam, she is a member of the auspicious class of Silicon Valley founders who are immigrants — among US startups valued above $1 billion, 51 percent have a foreign-born founder. Van earned her MBA at Stanford, locking herself into a network of hatchling executives. She had a pain point, realized that others shared her problem, and built a company to solve it. She debuted her app, Elsa Speak, at SXSW last year and promptly won an award. On paper, everything was Silicon Valley perfect.\n\nExcept that in every other way, Van doesn’t fit the American startup mold. She’s the only member of her company based in the US. She geared up to build her app, an AI assistant for English learners to improve their accents, by returning to Vietnam and immersing herself in the needs of her initial target users. Almost two years later, her seven employees are split between Vietnam and Portugal.\n\nFollow Backchannel: Facebook | Twitter\n\nVan doesn’t hesitate to call San Francisco home, but she also stays for a business reason, which is that the networking is second to none. “Vietnam is all about first-generation startups,” Van explains. “Everyone is still figuring out what they’re doing, and no one’s in a good place to mentor.” So she’s planted herself in the one place on Earth where you can’t do your dry cleaning without running into a potential advisor, expert, investor, or future hire. For her company, that edge makes the time zone patchwork worth the sacrifice of sleep and sanity.\n\nSo when Van first heard about Google’s new Launchpad Accelerator, she was skeptical. The company was in effect promising mature startups from emerging markets the most epic networking service on the planet: For every hiccup Elsa was facing, Google would match her and two colleagues with a top expert — sometimes the top expert — in that area. For free, with no catch, no quid pro quo. Van decided to give it a shot. Despite her Bay Area bonafides, launching a product in Vietnam had still been a slog.\n\nElsa is one of the rising stars of The Rest of the World—and Google has a plan to get in the door of companies like Van’s and shape them in its image. It wants to educate them on the best practices of product development and speed up their learning curves. Think of it as strategic philanthropy: In exchange for helping these companies grow, Google gets to scrutinize their books, observe how its own products are being used (or not) in less familiar markets, and spread its gospel to the far reaches of the globe. Eventually, these companies will play an enormous role in getting millions more people to conduct their lives online, and Google will be there as well, ready to scoop up new users.\n\n“The one thing emerging markets are missing is success stories,” says Roy Glasberg, Launchpad’s global manager. “You need an ecosystem.” A wiry Israeli sporting close-cropped hair and performance-wear chic, Glasberg is articulating an ideology percolating inside Google about why so few big companies emerge from outside Silicon Valley. He and his colleagues say the word “ecosystem” a lot. It’s a subtle, unstated way of contrasting the rich environment of the Bay Area, where investors, board members, competitors, and talented workers swirl in a self-pollinating bubble, with the relative deserts of countries such as Indonesia, Mexico, or even bigger players like Brazil. In the ecosystem view, the Bay Area is the goldilocks planet, and the rest of the world has the inhospitable climate of Mars or Mercury.\n\nGoogle’s theory is that until some company — any company! — has produced a massive IPO or engineered itself an eye-popping acquisition, a developing region won’t amass the resources it needs to support entrepreneurship. Venture capitalists are uneasy, or simply absent. The talent pool is shallow, with few local technologists who have first-hand experience transforming small companies into large ones. When you wonder where to find a good data scientist, or how to negotiate better terms in your series A, or what to fix in your app to get a better conversion rate, no one around you has the answers.\n\nSo a delta force within Google, led by Glasberg, set out to see if it could do what countless governments, regional technology parks, and grant programs have failed to do before it: fire up startup kilns around the world that then take on a life of their own. They would do so by picking the sharpest, most proven startups, and showering them with unconditional support for six months (and $50,000, but who’s counting)— essentially treating them as integrated wings of Google for the duration.\n\nTo earn that kind of access, these startups have to be much more than a Gucci knockoff. They’re not just the Postmates of the Philippines, or the Tesla of Thailand. They are fiercely unique, tackling unsolved problems and producing code that rivals anything emerging from San Francisco or the South Bay. These are the brightest minds of elsewhere. And Google’s now giving them a jolt of adrenaline straight from the planet’s entrepreneurial mothership: itself.\n\nTransporting the magic of Silicon Valley to other cities is a trope so old, and so beloved by government bureaucrats, that these days it hardly quickens the pulse. Silicon Alley. Silicon Glen. Silicon Wadi. Silicon Fen.\n\nSeated at a small table in the brand new San Francisco offices of the Launchpad Accelerator, Glasberg explains why Google’s approach is fundamentally different. “No one else is looking at emerging markets as a whole,” he says.\n\nAround him, a hundred-some entrepreneurs huddle in small group meetings with an elder statesman (or sometimes woman) of technology, or stare intently at their screens while seated elbow-to-elbow. We had to hunt to find two empty chairs, and eventually settled in between clusters of men leaning against low-slung cabinets, messenger bags strewn at their feet. The office hums with the low, persistent drone of voices.\n\nGlasberg, who first joined Google in Tel Aviv after a career in business development, has been formulating his own global theory of startup victory. “When you have a few successful startups, they come back and start investing in their community, starting funds,” Glasberg says. “You get a whole community boosting other startups.” He starts ticking off countries. “You don’t have that in Latin America. Brazil has never had a big exit. Argentina has had one.” From an investor’s point of view, he adds, startups “are already a risky business. So why should I go into a country that’s never had an exit?”\n\nThe local venture capitalists who do take a stake in emerging market companies tend to push for a faster path to monetization than do the firms on Sand Hill Road, which in turn affects how a startup develops its products. (With more generous funding, entrepreneurs often feel free to chase after a riskier, higher-payoff goal.) Some investors may demand a bigger cut of the company. The startup’s workers, meanwhile, are similarly circumspect about their employers, often requiring high salaries rather than agreeing to work for equity.\n\nThe problems don’t end with investment. Without having played host to past startups that either IPO’d or got acquired, a country will be home to few—if any—entrepreneurs with first-hand experience of building a company from ten employees to hundreds or thousands, navigating that country’s particular regulatory landscape, or overcoming the challenges that define many emerging markets, such as poor connectivity. In a word, they’re missing expertise.\n\nSo in 2015, Glasberg started scheming how Google might throw its weight behind solving what seemed to be the core problem—the lack of success stories. They settled on a strategy: They’d identify the best companies and try to solve as many of their business challenges as they could in a two-week Bay Area immersion program, followed by six months of remote mentorship.\n\nTo have the most impact, Glasberg says, he and his collaborators decided they wanted more mature startups, whose products already have a healthy base of users. Often these companies are two or three years old, sometimes with 100 or more employees, and most of them have already raised a round or two of funding. Many of them are profitable. So rather than risk alienating the most promising companies, which might not want to give up any more slices of their equity, the Launchpad team decided that it would simply advise — and reap rewards for Google through other channels.\n\n“The equity-free model lets us play the accelerator game further down the startup’s evolution,” explains Josh Yellin, a program manager on Glasberg’s team. A former river ecologist, he joined Google in September 2015 to manage programming for the company’s startup communities, before moving over to help build the nascent accelerator. While he was preparing for Launchpad’s inaugural Winter 2016 class, the founders he talked to were at first confused by the word “accelerator,” which usually applies to earlier-stage startups, when really he was targeting companies on the verge of rapid expansion. “We tossed around the word ‘scale-a-rator,’ but that sounds like some kind of animal no one would want to meet,” Yellin recalls.\n\nLast month, the third group of Launchpad inductees — three or so employees each from 31 companies out of nine countries — went through their two-week blitz at Google’s Bay Area offices. Around 150 mentors also joined, many flying in from around the world to conduct deep, screen-by-screen code reviews, assess every app’s design in minute detail, and pore over each company’s hiring practices.\n\n“We now have three classes of data of every mentorship session that happens. We have a note from every mentor of what came out of it—what was the challenge, and what was the solution recommended,” Yellin says. Using all those reports, “we’re basically creating a map of what makes startups successful around the world.”\n\nWhen they joined, the founders, many of them in their thirties, many of them armed with battle-tested self-assurance, were told they could name anyone among Google’s almost 50,000 employees, and the company would broker an introduction. It wasn’t hyperbole.\n\nOne founder and CEO, Reynazran Royono of Indonesia’s Snapcart, came to Launchpad nagged by an AI problem his team hadn’t solved. Snapcart users scan their receipts to earn cash-back rewards, but as the company grew to include 5,000 different grocery store chains and receipt formats, its engineers had stumbled into image recognition purgatory. So he requested a session with an expert on Tensorflow, Google’s widely used AI platform, and discovered that what he’d thought of as a mere annoyance was actually an open research question. “We talked to the Tensorflow guy, he said what we’re trying to crack is very difficult and he wanted to help,” Royono says. “But we’d get not just support from his team, but from the Google Brain guys, or the Ph.D. guys, to get help in cracking this problem.”\n\nA Brazilian startup called Portal Telemedicina, meanwhile, went straight for the crown jewels. It has built up a network of online doctors who can diagnose the scans and data generated by numerous clinics’ medical devices, and it also relies heavily on AI. “We said, OK, I want to talk to the head of artificial intelligence at Google,” says Rafael Figueroa, the company’s founder and CEO. “They connected us with the guy in England, who, like, invented this stuff. He knows stuff that wasn’t available online anywhere!”\n\nThe companies don’t just get resolution to bugs, though, as if they’re attending office hours back in college. The program is also built to spread startup best practices through hundreds of one-on-one sessions. For Van, the Vietnamese founder of Elsa, a prime goal was to steep two of her colleagues from Portugal in the Silicon Valley product development ethos: Iterate quickly, and don’t be afraid to launch imperfect products. In one meeting with a mentor, the team discussed how to solve some issues with its app’s onboarding flow. They were noticing that new users were dropping out partway through the app’s sign-up process, but they couldn’t figure out how to plug the leak. Her mentor, a renowned user experience expert named Jacob Greenshpan, suggested she try implementing a specific change over the weekend and see what happens. She said she’d think about it, falling back into a pattern of methodical deliberation that often characterized her team’s work. “And he said, ‘No, this is your homework for Saturday.’ So I said, ‘OK. Fine.’ And it worked! We got a 25 percent improvement,” she marvels.\n\nVan is the kind of entrepreneur who actually does her homework—who’ll read the 100-page manual and pore over every online resource she can find. But on normal days, she’s still effectively working alone. And her team can only absorb so many tech mantras from afar. Those limitations turn into the months-long headaches of, say, an imperfect onboarding experience.\n\nWhat these entrepreneurs’ stories suggest is there’s an implicit exceptionalism to how we view successful startups. The usual story goes something like this: The right group of founders got together, built an outstanding piece of software, and, through their collective brilliance, managed to accrue thousands and then millions of users. That framework is not wrong, exactly — but it underestimates the enormous boost these companies get by virtue of geography and timing. Silicon Valley startups are like plants in a nursery, kept out of the cold, bathed in sunlight, and lightly spritzed on a daily basis. Out in the wild they’d end up more scraggly, if they survive at all—so it’s a good thing someone came around beforehand to build their cozy greenhouse.\n\nBut even as these companies from outside the Valley get help from Google, some of them are beginning to compete with it. Van, for example, recently hired an engineer with expertise in AI out from under Google’s nose. Both Google and Amazon had made that engineer offers with significantly more money than Elsa could muster, Van says. But Elsa’s mission, with its potential to have a strong social impact, resonated with the engineer, so she turned down the Americans’ princely sums and moved from her home in Ukraine to join the team in Portugal.\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, gains plenty from bringing these startups into its fold. To get accepted, the companies undergo a grueling review, opening their books fully to Google employees. What emerges are not only the financial and technical details of individual companies, but also a growing portrait of startup health in a dozen different trying environments.\n\nThen there’s the product evangelism that occurs throughout the program. It’s no secret that Google has developed many platforms useful to startups —Firebase, Tensorflow, Google Cloud—and through Launchpad it’s assembled a captive audience of stellar engineers to listen as its employees rhapsodize about their favorite tools. “If they get the best startups to use their products in an early stage, it’s really hard to switch in the future, because the cost of switching is so high,” Van says.\n\nGlasberg takes a broader view. “Google gets two things out of this. One is really understanding what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur in emerging markets.” The other is that they can observe, under a microscope, developers from all corners of the world using Google products — the ultimate feedback. “We see firsthand what is working and what is not,” Glasberg says. “This is super critical, because these markets are the next billion. That’s where the future is.”\n\nThe present, however, remains stubbornly in the Bay Area. Van has just returned from another of her lightning trips to visit her team in Vietnam. But after each lap of the globe she always settles back into San Francisco, to drink from the firehose once more.\n\nMore from Outsiders Week:", "\"They can't just say look we're a technology company, we have nothing to do with the content that is appearing on our digital pages,\" Sorrell said. He added that, as far as placing advertisements was concerned, they have to be held to the same standards as traditional media organizations.\n\nAnother concern is that sometimes advertisements are automatically placed alongside objectionable and inappropriate content within those platforms that brands do not have control over.\n\n\"The big issue for Google and Facebook is whether they are going to have human editing at this point ... of course they have the profitability. They have the margins to enable them to do it. And this is going to be the big issue — how far are they prepared to go?\" Sorrell said, adding they needed to go \"significantly far\" to arrest these concerns.\n\nA failure to address such issues could see Facebook and Google potentially take hits on ad revenue if brands stop advertising on their platforms. For example, French advertising firm Havas recently pulled all its ad spend from Google and its video platform, YouTube.\n\nThe Guardian reported that Havas took the step after talks with Google broke down because the tech giant couldn't provide specific reassurances, policy and guarantees over the filtering and classification of video or display content.\n\nHavas' decision came after the UK government joined organizations including the Guardian, BBC and Transport for London in pulling advertising from Google and YouTube, the Guardian report said.\n\nSorrell said blanket withdrawals from advertisers across these digital platforms will not solve the problem. Instead, he urged for greater cooperation with the tech giants.\n\n\"I think the most constructive way of doing it is getting Google and Facebook to understand the problem, which I think they do, and to get them to step up to control it just like any other media right now would in a traditional sense,\" he said.", "The figures come amid controversy for Google, which has apologized to brands whose ads appeared next to extremist content on YouTube, while Facebook is tackling fake news on its site.\n\nAdvertisers' spend on digital formats globally will increase by 17.4 percent to $583.91 billion, equivalent to 38.3 percent of their entire ad budgets, the report also stated.\n\nSnapchat is set to make more money from advertising this year, growing its revenues to $900 million, representing a hike of 163.3 percent, eMarketer forecasts.\n\nChinese companies Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent will collectively make $35.82 billion from advertising this year, while Tencent's brand value has topped $100 billion, according to WPP's BrandZ report out this week.\n\n\"In the immediate future, the only other potential rivals to Facebook and Google are the big 3 Chinese companies, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BAT), who are riding on a wave of rising disposable incomes and a growing tech savvy population in China.

Until recently Google never gave the impression (through words or deeds) that cloud services were really important to it. It is now trying to make up for lost ground, but AWS and Microsoft are streets ahead,” he explained.\n\nWhen Kubernetes got started, it was an unnatural act. Google hadn’t contributed to an open source community, but a group of people internally thought they needed to change the game in the cloud and open source was the way to do it. — Scott Raney, Redpoint\n\nBut Google has been making some strides using open source to lead the way. Using Kubernetes, the popular open source container orchestration system as an example, Scott Raney, a partner at venture capitalist firm Redpoint, says it showed that Google could offer robust open source tools, something that surprised some people in this market.\n\n“When Kubernetes got started, it was an unnatural act. Google hadn’t contributed to an open source community, but a group of people internally thought they needed to change the game in the cloud and open source was the way to do it,” Raney said.\n\nKubernetes, and indeed all of the open source projects being generated by Google, such as TensorFlow for machine learning, Spanner for launching massive distributed databases or Draco for 3D graphics compression, to name but a few, were part of a concerted and deliberate effort in-house to be a more open organization.\n\nResistance is futile\n\nThat openness is what attracted GCP VP of product management, Sam Ramji to Google last November when he joined the company from Cloud Foundry. Ramji admits he wasn’t looking for a job, but he was pleasantly surprised to find such an open philosophy, and he saw the chance to shape Google Cloud into a developer-friendly platform — an opportunity, he says, that was too good to pass up.\n\n“My job is to make [the open philosophy] happen and to make it real,” Ramji explained. He said that, when he spoke to Google VP of cloud platforms Brian Stevens last year about taking this job, he hadn’t considered Google a place to work on open things. When he was told the vision was to make GCP the open cloud, “I thought that was really a shock,” he said.\n\nThat openness philosophy runs the gamut now including letting customers run whatever open source stack they choose on Google’s infrastructure, releasing and supporting open source projects and making the ecosystem, the partners who build tools and technologies on top of GCP, a first class citizen on the platform. “We are treating them as part of the whole and the net is bringing the tech you want and using Google technology or using any of the [partner] services,” Ramji said.\n\nFor example, its open source poster child, Kubernetes, can run on any platform. Just recently Microsoft announced Kubernetes on Azure. Ramji also points out with some excitement that there is more TensorFlow adoption on AWS than there is on GCP, which could be even more shocking than Kubernetes on Azure.\n\nMake it so\n\nThe question becomes, how do you differentiate yourself in a crowded market and Redpoint’s Raney says the way to win over developers is being open. “They need to win the hearts and minds of developers. Clearly Amazon has done that. If you’re Google, how do you play this game? You can’t just roll out similar services,” he said.\n\n“The fact that these guys have become much more supportive of the open source community makes people feel better about Google and makes developers feel better about working with their tools because they can avoid lock-in,” he added.\n\nIn fact, one of the biggest things that has frustrated enterprise buyers with traditional technology vendors was getting locked in, Greg DeMichillie, director of product management explained.\n\n“We invest as much in what it takes to get off of [our platform] as we have in getting on because we honestly believe open source and open APIs will be critical. Every enterprise you talk to signed contracts with ‘Oracles’ and other companies and they seemed like good deals, and in the end they were not happy — and the cloud is an opportunity not to repeat that mistake,” he said.\n\nForrester cloud analyst Dave Bartoletti says the company also could take advantage of its strength around data and analytics. “If I’ve got a terabyte of data with customer sentiment, how can I throw it on a platform and run machine learning algorithms and get useful answers to use — and make open source for even the partners to get something going,” he asked. This is precisely what Google is doing.\n\nGreene, speaking at the Goldman Sachs conference last month, pointed to data and analytics as a special strength for the company. When asked by the moderator what the easiest path to the enterprise could be, she answered that it was around data management and analytics.", "Google thinks its better for email users to stream video files than download them.\n\nThe search giant on Friday updated its Gmail service so that users can more easily view video attachments sent via email.

Instead, it works more like the third-party parental control and monitoring software already on the market, where an app installed on a parent’s device is used to configure settings and keep an eye on kids’ digital behavior.\n\nFor the system to work, Family Link requires that both parent and child use Android. The parent will first download the Family Link mobile app to their own device, running Android KitKat (4.4) or higher. An iOS version is not yet available, says Google.\n\nFrom this app, parents will set up the child’s Google account. It’s designed to be used for those children under the age of 13, Google notes.\n\nThen, on the kid’s device, the child signs in using these new credentials. The child’s phone or tablet must be running either Android Nougat (7.0), or a supported device running Marshmallow (6.1). (A full list is here in the Family Link FAQ.)\n\nOnce signed in, the child’s phone usage is tracked and logged, so parents can see how much time kids spend in various apps, via weekly and monthly activity reports. From the parent’s app, moms and dads can set a number of rules for their kids, including how long kids are allowed to be on their mobile devices every day, at what time the devices can no longer be used that day (through a remote locking feature), and which apps can be installed.\n\nParents can approve or block apps the child wants to download from the Google Play Store, much like how Apple’s iCloud Family Sharing’s “Ask” feature works today.\n\nLike Apple, Google doesn’t offer any suggestions as to whether a given app should be approved, however – that decision is left up to the parents’ discretion.\n\nExplains Google:\n\n“[Family Link] can’t make the apps or services on their phone that were designed for adults kid-safe; it’s up to parents to choose what’s right for their kid.”\n\nA lack of guidance is one of the gaping holes with many parental control systems today. That’s unfortunate given that all the app stores have app ratings. It seems that simply highlighting the rating to parents during the “Ask” process could go a long way to helping parents make better decisions.\n\nThat being said, Family Link does allow parents to at least remotely configure the filtering options for some of Google’s own apps, like the Google Search app and the Chrome browser. This will protect kids from adult content and other inappropriate material when doing web searches.\n\nPlus, having standalone application that lets parents remotely configure a variety of control mechanisms for children’s devices will be generally helpful, and could become a selling point for Android phones and tablets.\n\nFamily Link isn’t yet broadly available. Google is offering early access to testers willing to try the service during this early preview, and provide feedback.", "Get ready for a big change for Google’s popular Hangouts.\n\nThe search giant is splitting its video and chatting service into two separate products to better appeal to business customers. As of Thursday, Hangouts Meet will be focused on corporate video conferencing while Hangouts Chat will target workplace chat and business productivity.\n\nThe revamped Hangouts apps are part of Google’s G Suite portfolio of workplace software that includes the Gmail and Calendar apps, said Google’s director of product management Scott Johnston. Unlike the free version of Hangouts used by consumers, businesses will have to pay for the new services as part of a package deal for G Suite, like they do for the current enterprise-version of Hangouts. Johnston said Google's existing Hangouts enterprise customers will not be charged extra for the new Hangouts apps.\n\nGoogle's revamp of Hangouts is part of a broader push into enterprise technology and away from its roots as a consumer-oriented search and advertising business. Since hiring Diane Greene, the former CEO and founder of enterprise software company VMware ( vmw ) , as head of its cloud business unit, Google is heavily marketing itself as a sort of one-stop-shop for business technology.\n\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nIn addition to selling basic computing infrastructure in what’s known as cloud computing, Google ( goog ) is also selling database software, developer tools, and workplace productivity apps.\n\n“We are fighting this perception that we are search,” said Scott Johnston, Google’s director of product management, while citing progress in enterprise software. “It feels like it is less of an uphill battle now.”\n\nBut the company still faces many challenges.\n\nFor one, numerous rivals are also investing heavily in areas that Google wants to dominate. The biggest cloud-computing vendor Amazon ( amzn ) , for example, just recently debuted its own Chime video conferencing service and will reportedly introduce more workplace software soon. Microsoft ( msft ) , on the other hand, operates its popular Skype video conferencing service, and its long-awaited Teams chat app will be released next week.\n\nCisco ( csco ) , Atlassian ( team ) , and Slack also sell similar tools.\n\nGoogle is pitching its new conferencing app as faster to set up meetings than competing web conferencing services like Cisco’s WebEx. The new Hangouts Meet app, which Google accidentally pushed live to its online store before the app's debut, also comes with the ability to record meetings, has various features intended to satisfy company legal teams like the ability to retain conferencing data, and can handle up to 30 people at once.\n\nHangouts Chat, which will be available to the general public at an undisclosed date, is similar to other competing chat services like Slack, which lets employees initiate conversations with others based on topics. However, both Hangouts Chat and Meet were built on top of several homegrown Google services like the Spanner database that Johnston claims make the services less likely to crash.\n\nThe apps are also connected to Google’s machine-learning tools that make it possible for so-called software bots to automatically perform various tasks. These tasks include scheduling meetings based on when people's respective calendars show they're available.\n\nStill, the fact that Google is essentially splitting its popular Hangouts app into two services has the potential to confuse people who are used to seeing both chat and video conferencing features glued together.\n\nAlthough Google wants to popularize its Hangouts apps to business clientele, many consumers still use Hangouts in its current state to call family and chat with friends. Google is trying to convince consumers to switch from Hangouts to its Duo video-calling app and Allo messaging app, but its unclear how many people currently use those new services. Eventually, consumers will be \"upgraded to Hangouts Meet and Chat,\" but those versions won't contain the data retention services, conferencing features, or other bushiness-oriented features like the paid versions, Johnston said.\n\nIt’s also unclear how many users will upgrade from the free version of Hangouts to the new paid services. Johnston is optimistic, saying “the freemium model works,” the idea of luring customers with free services that they can upgrade by paying, but Google does not disclose how many people do so.\n\nGoogle also has a history of killing off products after a while like Google Reader for receiving news feeds, Google Search Appliance, and Google Site Search, for companies to use Google search for internal documents. Additionally, Google said recently that it would stop supporting its Spaces messaging app that it debuted in May.\n\nFor more about technology and finance, watch :\n\nJohnston, who did not work on the Spaces app, said he “understands where the perception comes from” that Google can appear uncommitted to products. It’s a delicate balance, however, because Google “wants to be a company that is willing to try anything” while also ensuring people that it’s dedicated to its experiments that may not pan out.\n\nBy splitting Hangouts into two new apps that both contain the word “Hangouts,” it is opening the door to confusion.\n\nBut the new Hangouts apps put ease-of-use at the forefront, Johnston said, and they “can strip away all of the mundane steps” people have to do before they initiate online video conferencing and host online chats.\n\nFor Google, its technology makes its products superior. As for corporate branding, that remains to be seen.\n\nUpdate: Thursday, Mar. 9, 3:05 PM with more details on pricing for existing Google business customers.", "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation sharing is back in Google Maps.

To help with that, Google created a new open-source JPEG encoder that will purportedly reduce the file sizes of images while maintaining picture quality, allowing websites to load faster.\n\nThe new encoder is called Guetzli — Swiss German for “cookie,” apparently — and according to Google, it can create “high quality JPEG images with file sizes 35 percent smaller than currently available methods.” The advantage to using Guetzli instead of a new format is that the images are still regular JPEG files, and so they’re still compatible with almost every browser and application that exists.\n\nGoogle has several other projects to reduce image sizes on the web, including its Zopfli encoder (which similarly creates smaller PNG files without breaking format compatibility) and WebP (a new image format that supports both lossless and lossy compression for improved file sizes).\n\nAccording to Google, Guetzli does take “significantly longer” to compress images than other methods of JPEG encoding, but it feels that the slower speed in creating the image is worth the speed gains when loading it. Additionally, the company cites a Google Research paper that claims that users found the Guetzli images to be of higher quality than similar and even larger JPEG files created with other methods.\n\nFor more details on the nitty-gritty of how Guetzli actually accomplishes the improved encoding (it apparently involves “psychovisual models”) check out the Google Research Blog and the published paper on Guetzli.", "As of 2015, Google held 3 percent of the enterprise productivity suite software market, with an estimated $397.4 million in revenue, according to research firm Gartner. Microsoft, with almost $12.7 billion in revenue, held a little more than 95 percent.\n\nThat’s a gap Google clearly hopes to close with its recent push into enterprise. The company has been adding artificial intelligence features to tools, and even released a piece of hardware that integrates with G Suite, its Microsoft Office competitor, in an effort to attract the kind of enterprise customers that are entrenched in Microsoft products.\n\nOne large customer that Google recently announced it had lured to G Suite is Verizon, which shifted 150,000 of its employees to the platform.\n\nG Suite is offered to professional customers in different price tiers (basic, business and enterprise) and different versions. A free version of G Suite for educators, for example, is comparable to the business version, but with some modifications, according to a Google spokesperson.\n\nMany tools that are part of G Suite are available for free to consumer users with Google accounts; these tools include Gmail, Hangouts communications tools, word processor Docs and Excel competitor Sheets.\n\nBefore G Suite, there were free business Gmail accounts, which came after the release of the consumer version of Gmail. Here’s a compact rundown of the origins of G Suite, and how it expanded and changed over time:\n\n2004: The consumer version of Gmail launched as an invitation-only product that was still in testing, according to Matthew Glotzbach, former director of product management for Google Apps and Google Enterprise.\n\n2005/2006: By early 2006, Google announced Gmail for Your Domain, and San Jose City College was one of the first organizations to test it. Glotzbach said the apps and tools that make up what is now called G Suite were layered into this professional version of Gmail.\n\n2006: Later in 2006, Google launched Google Apps for Your Domain, the first iteration of what eventually became known as G Suite. This included Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Talk (the precursor to Google Hangouts, which in its current form offers text, video and audio conversation options), and web publishing tool Google Page Creator, the precursor to Sites. The company offered a free version of the suite and was still working on a premium paid version.\n\n2007: Google Apps Premier Edition, the first paid version of Google Apps, was released. New features included more storage and 24-hour support, according to a Google spokesperson. In a press release about the news, Google named Procter & Gamble Global Business Services, Salesforce.com and Prudential Preferred Properties as customers. Also in 2007, Google Docs and Google Spreadsheets, the latter now called Sheets, which were existing offerings from Google, were incorporated into paid and free versions of the suite.\n\n2011: Google set a limit of 10 users per account for the free version of Google Apps. It’s not clear how many users had previously been allowed on the free version, but according to a user who wrote in a help forum, the company had previously allowed up to 50 users on a free account.\n\n2012: This is the year Google stopped offering free Google Apps accounts to new users. Legacy free accounts stopped receiving new features added to paid accounts at this time, according to a Google spokesperson. However, to date, legacy accounts are still supported. These accounts differ from consumer Gmail and Google accounts, which give users access to free versions of certain apps in G Suite, in that they have features otherwise limited to paid accounts, including customizable domains, freedom from ads in Gmail and support for multiple users if already included on the account.\n\nAlso in 2012, Google added cloud storage service Google Drive to the suite of tools; it’s currently available to both paying and non-paying consumer users, though it’s unclear if it may have been for paying customers only in the beginning. Google also added archiving service Vault, which is available to certain tiers of paying customers and can also be purchased separately, according to the spokesperson.\n\nAlso during this year, a slideshow tool previously incorporated into Docs was broken out as its own tool, Slides, according to a Google spokesperson.\n\nAnd Google appointed Diane Greene, co-founder and former CEO of cloud computing software company VMware, to its board of directors.\n\n2015: Google hired Greene to lead enterprise efforts including cloud computing and productivity applications. The move was read as indication that the company is serious about making a bigger play in the enterprise market, where it has lagged behind Microsoft and Amazon.\n\n2016: Google Apps was rebranded as G Suite. The rebranding came with a lot of name-changing which is explained here. Google announced a piece of hardware called the Jamboard that integrates with G Suite tools. Jamboard is an interactive screen that automatically saves images created on it and can be shared with remote workers by video chat. The company additions include a new tool called App Maker, which helps developers create new apps for G Suite." ] }

Read on.\n\nI switched, as an experiment, from the iPhone 7 Plus to the Pixel XL. This is my take after more than a month. What follows is meant to wrap up, as briefly as possible, earlier takes.\n\nNote that I did not -- and will not -- ditch my iPhone 7 Plus. It's still sitting right next to the Pixel XL on my desk.\n\nAnd note that reportedly holiday sales of the Pixel were strong, with Pixel devices accounting for 12.3 percent of phone activations with Verizon, according to Bloomberg. Some stores didn't have enough inventory to meet demand, the report said -- which I can confirm, after canvassing local Los Angeles Verizon stores.\n\nChassis: For me, this is a pretty big deal. The weight, how it sits in your hand, and the ability to fit a large screen into a relatively small chassis (aka, bezel size) for one-handed operation are all boxes to be checked when buying a phone. Google succeeds here. Though slightly thicker (we're talking only about a 1mm difference) than the 7 Plus, it's lighter and, side by side, the Pixel XL is smaller and feels that way in your hand. That said, I can't definitively say that the XL's chassis is better than the 7 Plus' (I've always liked the feel of the iPhone 6/6s/7). What I can say is that, at the very least, it's the iPhone's equal. And I'm guessing some may prefer the XL because of its smaller size despite having the same 5.5-inch display.\n\nUX (user experience): Subjective yet important. The only thing I'll say here (because it's so subjective) is that it was a painless switch to Android 7.1 Nougat from iOS*. Everything I need is on both phones and once you're inside an app, it's often impossible to tell which phone you're using. And compared to the Android that ran on my Moto X (2nd gen) a couple years back, Android is smoother/vastly improved.\n\nPerformance: Cite all the benchmarks you want but for what I do it's a draw. Some benchmarks show the iPhone 7 Plus' A10 Fusion processor beating the XL's Snapdragon 821. Fine. But I don't see it. Both phones are fast and smooth -- and when I'm doing something as simple as scrolling a graphics-intensive Web page or more processor-intensive stuff like working with photos/video, both are faster than any smartphone I've used before.\n\nDisplay: The Pixel's AMOLED display is the future, Apple's LCD the past. That said, Apple and its display partners have come up with the best LCD on an iPhone yet, as pointed out by DisplayMate Technologies. Just to look at casually, however, I like the Pixel XL's AMOLED display better. It tends to be brighter, the colors more vibrant but the iPhone tends to reproduce more accurate colors in photos (in my experience). Not always but often. The upshot is that Apple's LCD is so good that it's able to keep up with Google's AMOLED. But I don't think that will be the case going forward as AMOLEDs pull away and yield devices that bend and fold.\n\nCamera: I covered this already in previous write-ups, so I won't delve a lot into it here. Suffice to say, I've taken lots of photos with both cameras and neither disappoints. The scary thing is, how good the XL's camera is right out of the gate (previous experience with Nexus phones notwithstanding). Photography review sites have praised the Pixel XL's excellent HDR+ mode and image detail, among other things. One of the few XL shortcomings is the lack of 7 Plus’ optical zoom. Upshot: I think the two cameras are almost a draw though an amateur photographer I've consulted with favors the Pixel XL over the iPhone 7 Plus. So, I'll defer to him.\n\nBattery Life: The XL has a “Doze” mode that is better than the iPhone 7 Plus at sipping energy. Depending on how much I'm using the phone on a particular day, this alone can extend battery life beyond the iPhone 7 Plus for me. But with more active use, the two phones are battery-life equals. (See this YouTube test for guidance.) I usually can get a day and a half (or longer) from both phones.\n\nGoogle Assistant vs. Siri: The Pixel is the first Android phone to implement Google Assistant, an intelligent personal assistant. Google is the early leader here. In my experience, Google Assistant more often than not provides better responses to the kinds of questions I ask: spoken responses were usually more relevant/helpful than Apple’s Siri, which too often resorted to spitting out a bunch of search results.\n\nFingerprint reader: Per a reader's comment, I forgot to cover this! The fingerprint reader on the back of the Pixel XL is actually pretty easy to get used to. Yes, you have to pick it up but it's very accurate. Note that I had to return the first iPhone 7 Plus I got (and get a replacement) because it could not consistently read my fingerprint. My 7 Plus replacement is better but not as good/fast as the Pixel.\n\nShortcomings vs iPhone 7 Plus: The Pixel XL is not as water resistant as the iPhone 7 Plus and, as I said above, raw performance benchmarks tend to favor the iPhone 7 Plus. Also, on a personal note, I am a heavy user of the Apple Watch Series 2. In fact, these days I probably spend more time on the Watch than I do the iPhone. So, I hope that Google and a partner follow through with a smartwatch, as has been rumored. A smartwatch that is tailored for its Pixel phones would be welcome and something I would use immediately and would make the Pixel experience that much better.\n\n*This is not a review of Android and iOS. That's would a separate review sans hardware discussion.", "Google is expanding its presence in the ride-sharing market.\n\nThe tech giant is expanding the service to its Waze navigation app in \"several\" cities across the United States and in Latin America over the next few months, the Wall Street Journal reports. The decision to enter the market came after a successful trial run in Israel and San Francisco.\n\nThe move makes Google a competitor for Uber — a company it was once allies with, notes the Journal (in 2013, Google invested some $258 million in Uber through its Google Ventures capital arm). However, it is important to note that Waze's services are still different from soon-to-be rivals Uber and Lyft. Instead of working as an on-demand taxi service, Waze \"wants to persuade regular drivers using its navigation app to pick up people who are heading in the same direction,\" the Journal reports.\n\n\"Can we get the average person on his way to work to pick someone up and drop them off once in a while? That’s the biggest challenge,” Waze CEO Noam Bardin told the Journal .\n\nWaze's prices also differentiate it from Uber and Lyft. According to the Journal, a ride from downtown Oakland, Calif. to downtown San Francisco costs a mere $4.50, where the same trip using either UberPool or Lyft Line is $10.57 and $12.40, respectively. To prevent drivers from using Waze as their main source of income, notes the Journal , riders only pay drivers $0.54 per mile, which is the current IRS reimbursement rate .\n\nAs of now, Waze doesn't take a cut of its driver's earning either — though will likely change to a 15% fee for riders if the service does well, according to the Journal .", "Google is saying goodbye to one of its many messaging apps.\n\nThe search giant said Friday on a technical support page that it would shut down its Spaces app on Apr.17. Google debuted the app in May and pitched it as an easy way for people to conduct multiple online conversations based on individual topics like sports and news.\n\nThe app was tethered to several other Google ( goog ) products like search and YouTube, and was intended to encourage people to chat and share articles and videos with each other inside the app.\n\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nApparently, Spaces never caught on, and it joins several other messaging and social networking apps that Google has revamped or shuttered over the years because of a lack of popularity, including Google+ and Wave.\n\n\"Our goal with Spaces was to create a better small-group sharing experience, and we’ll use what we’ve learned to improve other Google products and services,\" the search giant said on the support page.\n\n\"It was a tough decision, and it’s tough to say goodbye,\" Google added.\n\nPeople can still read older messages on Spaces over the next few weeks, but they won't be able to create new group chats, leave comments, or share videos and other content.\n\nFor more about Google, watch :\n\nAfter April 17, Google said it would delete the app in its entirety along with user data.", "Cyanogen, the company responsible for the commercialisation of CyanogenMod is to cease all operations by the end of 2016. There will be no further updates to the OS, no more nightly builds and no further security updates. Phones that run the OS, like the original OnePlus handset, will need to switch to the Open Source version of the OS.\n\nThe company had some success selling its OS to manufacturers like WileyFox and OnePlus that lacked the resources to build their own customised Android interfaces. And it's true to say that the mod, in its early form, was the go-to build for people who wanted more features than Android offered in the Google build. Sadly, the most high-profile customer OnePlus pulled the plug and moved to its own build of Android called OxygenOS.\n\nThe open source project upon which Cyanogen was based can, and probably will, continue. The big problem it now faces is the same as any Android mod, namely time and resources. It's hard to make money on mods, and with Android getting more and more capable every iteration mods are also less necessary than they were when Cyanogen first started out.\n\nWhile continuing is a likely, it won't be easy and the CyanogenMod team made a statement describing the shutdown as \"[a] death blow\". It will certainly be hard to continue without resources and that leaves those who no longer have official support with handsets that won't get security patches. This is a major problem, and many of those users probably won't want to move themselves over to the open source version of the OS.\n\nSo is it a surprise we're here? Not really, just last month Forbes Contributor Ryan Whitwam posted that the company was cutting back, reducing staff numbers and would ultimately close completely.\n\nOne of the most astonishing quotes I've ever read about Cyanogen was right here, on Forbes, back in 2015. It came from Kirt McMaster, CEO of Cyanogen, and he said \"We're putting a bullet through Google's head\". This was everything a soundbite needed to be, crass and attention grabbing. Sadly though - and I did mutter this to myself at the time - it was nothing more than an empty threat.\n\nThe problem is, it's hard to put a bullet in the head of a company which makes the thing you based your product on. Cyanogen was nothing without the Android Open Source Project, which is the unrestricted version of Google's Android OS. Usually, it's packaged without the Google Play Services which make Android such a powerful proposition. It's hard to turn this into a workable version of Android unless you can source an alternative app store too. However, Cyanogen did manage to make a deal with Google that allowed it to package its services along with the OS it sold to third-parties.\n\nOne thing is clear though, it's really hard to beat Google at its own game. Cyanogen was a product that offered Android phone owners an alternative to the heavily customised UIs of their phones. But since, Google has released devices like the Pixel and Samsung, LG and Sony have all paired back the level of customisation they add to devices - partly in response to Cyanogen and other mods.\n\nCyanogen gave us a lot of good stuff in the world of Android phones. We should thank them - certainly the open source project, of not the incorporated company that will fold soon. It's possible to argue that this OS made everything better in Android.

The Home normally retails for $130, and you can get it for $99 plus six months of free YouTube Red, the video site’s ad-free subscription service, if you manage to snag the deal between November 24th and November 26th. Best Buy’s ad indicates that the deal is not restricted to in-store purchase only, so the web store listing link for the Home should reflect the price change after 5PM ET on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nWhile it does have its limitations now just a little over a month after launch, Google Home is a solid alternative to Amazon’s Echo speaker. Instead of using a personified AI, like the Echo’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri, Google relies on voice-powered variation of its Google Assistant, the same software that powers its new Allo chat app. Still, these speakers are mostly used to play music, get basic web info, and do small tasks like setting timers and checking directions. You can pair more than one together for a Sonos-like effect, if you’re interested in purchasing more than one.\n\nGoogle does have one thing going for it that others don’t: its Chromecast family of devices gives the Home an easy communication link to your media center, should you happen to own a Chromecast Audio or the standard Chromecast. If you’re interested in comparing these deals with Amazon’s, the online retailer is running its own Echo promotions for Black Friday, including the standard speaker for $139.99, the Echo Dot for $39.99, and the Amazon Tap for $89.99.

But it’s not hard to envision a future in which multiple computer agents will work together to solve even bigger problems. In a recent experiment, Alphabet Inc's DeepMind team set out to illustrate how learning machines work together—or occasionally, as it turns out, don’t.\n\nThe team ran thousands of iterations of two simple games, allowing programs controlling them to learn the most effective strategies. In one, two A.I.s competed to gather the most resources (green ‘apples’), and could also choose whether or not to sabotage their competition with the yellow zaps seen in the video below.\n\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter.\n\nWhat they found raises some concerns about our imminent A.I.-driven future. As the team detailed in a blog post , computer agents in the apple-gathering scenario tended to coexist peacefully when there were plenty of resources. But when apples became scarce, they quickly turned to sniping one another to get an edge.\n\nMore concerning still, “agents with the capacity to implement more complex strategies try to tag the other agent more frequently, i.e. behave less cooperatively,” regardless of how many resources were around. Smart robots, in other words, have no inherent hesitation to harm one another in pursuit of their goals—or, presumably, to do the same to any human who might get in their way.\n\nIn a different scenario, though, the programs found more reason to work together. When set to ‘hunt’ for shared rewards, A.I.s would figure out how to collaborate—and were actually more likely to do so the smarter they were.\n\nThe assumptions behind these experiments deserve some scrutiny. The researchers specifically equate their hyper-rational A.I. agents with “homo economicus”—that is, the imaginary, purely gains-maximizing human that made up the flawed core of 20th century economics. But in the real world, humans aren’t all that consistently rational, casting some doubt on the researchers’ claims that their game theory scenarios could help us understand human systems like the economy and traffic.\n\nAnd future robots themselves aren’t unavoidably fated to exist as pure maximizing agents. Even learning and evolving A.I.s could be designed with behavioral guidelines that would supersede their narrowest imperatives, ala Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics. It’s not without its challenges , but the uneven behavior of DeepMind’s competitive algorithms suggests some form of empathy should be on programmers’ to-do lists.", "Titan Aerospace, a drone startup, was bought by Google in 2014. (Image: Titan Aerospace)\n\nSince Google morphed into a new company called Alphabet last year, there’s been an apparent bloodbath for the tech giant’s popular (and costly) “moonshot” projects. These longer-term, riskier ventures are suddenly being held to account for the amount of money they were losing. The result hasn’t been pretty. Alphabet has since systematically killed many of the projects, and we can now add one more to the growing list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProject Titan, the drone program that Google thought could beam internet down to Earth using solar-powered aircraft, is officially being axed. As first reported by 9to5Google and later confirmed by Gizmodo, the Titan group was recently shut down and more than 50 engineers were told to look for new jobs. The company announced the news in a statement.\n\nThe team from Titan was brought into X in late 2015. We ended our exploration of high altitude UAVs for internet access shortly after. By comparison, at this stage the economics and technical feasibility of Project Loon present a much more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world. Many people from the Titan team are now using their expertise as part of other high flying projects at X, including Loon and Project Wing.\n\nThis shouldn’t have been much of a surprise to anyone following Alphabet’s restructuring. According to the most recent earnings report, Alphabet’s “other bets,” which includes all of the moonshot projects, reported a third quarter operating loss of $865 million. The company does not break out the operating costs of each project, but it’s safe to assume that research and development for a flying internet drone doesn’t come cheap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlphabet’s internet drone program has rightfully faced scrutiny since April 2014, when Google first acquired the drone startup Titan Aerospace for an undisclosed amount. In May 2015, during one of its earliest test flights, a prototype for the solar-powered drone crashed at a New Mexico test site.\n\nA report from the National Transportation Safety Board published a year later declared “the aircraft began an uncontrollable and erratic flight path roughly straight ahead in a rapid descent” because of a wing failure. The drone reportedly had a wingspan of 164 feet, nearly the same as a Boeing 747 with a wingspan of 196 feet, so you can imagine what the crash scene looked like.\n\nImage: AP\n\nWhile the notion of internet-delivery drones is exciting for anyone that loves science and technology, the economic realities of this dreamy idea are hard to ignore. Google’s retreat could have a major impact on other big companies invested in the internet space race—namely Facebook—who built an internet-delivery drone of its own.\n\n\n\nSponsored\n\nFacebook’s Aquila drone, which is also supposed to beam Internet down to Earth, crashed in June 2016 during its first test flight. According to a National Transportation Safety Board report, the drone suffered “structural failure” as it prepared for landing. The incident was classified as an “accident” by the NTSB that resulted in “substantial” damage to the aircraft. Turns out building concepts straight out of science-fiction novels is actually pretty tough.\n\nThe failure of Alphabet’s Project Titan is just the latest reminder that moonshot projects are hard to pull off, even with teams of the best engineers in the world. Alphabet investors have certainly taken notice, which is why some of the company’s moonshots are getting scrapped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn December 2016, The Information reported that Alphabet was “scaling back” its self-driving car—another widely publicized moonshot project that geeks had high hopes for. According to the report, Alphabet “settled on a more practical effort to partner with automakers.” The company launched Waymo in December of last year, with the goal of competing more aggressively with fast-moving self-driving car competitors like Uber, which has a fleet of autonomous vehicles already on the road.\n\nImage: AP\n\nAlphabet also killed its modular phone moonshot, Project Ara, last September. Project Ara was one of the first flagship programs from the revered Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) group, which Google inherited from Motorola. The goal of the project was to build a phone with interchangeable parts in order to reduce electronic waste and prolong the lifespan of smartphones. The company had even promoted a timeline for opening up sales to the public in 2017 during its 2016 developer conference, Google I/O, before mercilessly killing the project a couple of months later.\n\n\n\n“It’s disappointing to the teams who have worked so hard to make it real, disheartening to the developers hoping to bring their innovations to life, and frustrating to the fans across the world who were so eager to have Ara in their hands,” said creator of Project Ara Dan Makoski in a 9to5Google report, following the announcement. The quote should give some indication as to how blindsided the engineers are during these type of decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlphabet has also reportedly decided to put Boston Dynamics—the company that built terrifying robots like BigDog and Atlas—up for sale. It bought the company back in 2013. According to a Bloomberg report in March 2016, executives focused on making sure all of the companies under its corporate umbrella were able to generate revenue “concluded that Boston Dynamics isn’t likely to produce a marketable product in the next few years.” In June 2016, Nikkei Asian Review reported that Toyota was in “final talks” to acquire the robotics division from Alphabet.\n\nThen there’s Google Fiber, a seemingly obvious product that sells something everyone wants—super fast internet. Alphabet announced in October the company was “pausing” its Fiber operation in ten cities. The announcement used similar language to press releases about discontinuing Project Ara and other moonshot projects. In this case, engineers were at least given a warning shot when Alphabet CEO Larry Page passed strong recommendations to Google Fiber leader Craig Barrat and told him to cut his staff numbers in half.\n\nThat doesn’t leave many moonshots left. There are still ambitious projects like Alphabet’s smart contact lenses (under development from a company called Verily) or its life extension project (from a company called Calico). Still, Google Fiber, Project Ara, Project Titan, and the company’s self-driving cars are the ambitious projects that have represented the enterprising spirit the company has long embraced—and that tech fans loved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt might just be part of Google’s—er, Alphabet’s—maturation that it won’t publicly bet on moonshot ideas as much anymore. We’ll have to wait and see. It’s too early to declare the moonshot dead entirely. After all, the company is still burning billions of dollars on projects that don’t make any money. Let’s just hope the company keeps dreaming big.", "For the past year, Google's car project has been a talent sieve, thanks to leadership changes, strategy doubts, new startup dreams and rivals luring self-driving technology experts. Another force pushing people out? Money. A lot of it.\n\nEarly staffers had an unusual compensation system that awarded supersized payouts based on the project's value. By late 2015, the numbers were so big that several veteran members didn't need the job security anymore, making them more open to other opportunities, according to people familiar with the situation. Two people called it \"F-you money.\"\n\nIn December, the car unit morphed into a standalone business called Waymo, and the system was replaced with a more uniform pay structure that treats all employees the same, according to a person familiar with the situation. Still, the original program got so costly that a top executive at parent Alphabet Inc. highlighted it last year to explain a jump in expenses. A spokeswoman for Alphabet, the holding company that owns Google and \"Other Bets\" like the autonomous car business, declined to comment.\n\nThe payouts contributed to a talent exodus at a time when the company was trying to turn the project into a real business and emerging rivals were recruiting heavily. The episode highlights Alphabet's difficult transition from a digital advertising giant into a diversified technology company with varied groups of employees requiring different incentives. Other new businesses, including health care unit Verily, use different compensation systems too, but they have yet to generate huge payouts like the car project.\n\nThe unorthodox system started in 2010, soon after Google unveiled its first self-driving vehicle. It was constructed to tie employees' fortunes to the performance of the project, rather than Google's advertising money machine. In addition to cash salaries, some staffers were given bonuses and equity in the business and these awards were set aside in a special entity. After several years, Google applied a multiplier to the value of the awards and paid some or all of it out. The multiplier was based on periodic valuations of the division, the people said.\n\nThe precise metrics that the division was measured by-- and caused the bonuses to balloon-- are not known. But by 2015, the Google car project had come a long way: Google’s vehicles had logged more than one million autonomous miles; car companies including Toyota Motor Corp. and Tesla Inc. announced their own plans to develop autonomous systems; and analysts predicted the technology would transform the auto industry.\n\nA large multiplier was applied to the compensation packages in late 2015, resulting in multi-million dollar payments in some cases, according to the people familiar with the situation. One member of the team had a multiplier of 16 applied to bonuses and equity amassed over four years, one of the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about private matters.\n\n\n\nPart of the problem was that payouts snowballed after key milestones were reached, even though the ultimate goal of the project -- fully autonomous vehicles provided to the public through commercial services -- remained years away.\n\nRuth Porat Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg\n\nIt’s unclear how much the payouts cost Alphabet, however, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat talked about it during an earnings conference call with analysts in early 2016.\n\nOperating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015 rose 14 percent to $6.6 billion, \"primarily driven by R&D expense, particularly affected by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets established several years ago,\" Porat said, according to a transcript. The CFO wasn’t specific, but one of the people familiar with the situation said the comments referred to the car project compensation.\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nStaff departures from the car division increased in 2016. Some were frustrated with the pace of progress and had doubts about new leader John Krafcik, while others wanted to start their own autonomous vehicle companies, people familiar with the matter said. The big payouts exacerbated the situation because team members had less financial incentive to stay, the people familiar with the situation said.\n\nChris Urmson, previous leader of the project, departed in August and is working on a startup. Other early project members left to form Otto, a self-driving trucking company that was quickly snapped up by Uber Technologies Inc. Bryan Salesky, a former Google car executive, started Argo AI, which got a $1 billion investment from Ford Motor Co. on Friday.\n\nUrmson and Salesky didn’t respond to requests for comment. Sebastian Thrun, who started the car project and helped design the pay system, didn’t respond to questions, either.\n\nDuring the early 2016 conference call, Porat suggested a different approach to incentives at Other Bets in the future. \"It is about getting more ambitious things done. We’re doing that in a framework to ensure we are disciplined with our resources, and this was just calling out a milestone established some time ago,\" she said.", "We're barely halfway through January of 2017, and it's already looking like this is going to be the year of Amazon's Alexa, the virtual assistant at the heart of the Amazon Echo.\n\nIn 2016, the Amazon Echo line of devices appeared to have a great sales year, with the cheap Echo Dot smart speaker finishing out the holiday shopping season as the best-selling item on all of Amazon.com. Forrester research estimates that 6 million Amazon Echo devices were sold by the end of 2016.\n\nAnd at the Consumer Electronics Show in the first week of January, Amazon dominated the conversation. LG, GE, Ford, and lots more companies announced gadgets, home appliances, and even cars that can connect to Alexa. The market for the Echo is still small compared to smartphones, but it's growing fast.\n\nIt's all led to the conventional wisdom that Amazon is winning the race to rule the growing market for voice assistants and the apps that run on them, and, by extension, the still-very-young market for smart home gadgetry. And so far, Alexa has run this race largely unchallenged.\n\nUnchallenged until now, that is. With the Google Home device and its Google Assistant, the search giant is looking to eat Amazon's lunch. Microsoft is positioning its Cortana personal assistant as the artificially intelligent way to get work done. Even Apple is said to be working on an Echo-esque device.\n\nHere's a look at how Amazon propelled itself into this leading position in the first place, where its biggest rivals still have room to overtake it, and why Apple needs to move in on this sooner rather than later.\n\nWhy Amazon leads\n\n\"[Amazon Echo] took us all a little by surprise,\" says Gartner Research Director Werner Goertz.\n\nA big part of Amazon's early success with the Echo, launched in 2014, is due to the fact that the company didn't oversell it. After years of iPhone users getting let down by Siri, the first truly mainstream voice agent, Amazon billed the Echo as a speaker that, by the way, has a few smart voice commands built in.\n\nThen, just as people got accustomed to the idea of talking to Alexa, and positive word of mouth spread, Amazon added more capabilities. Alexa now boasts thousands of \"skills\" that allow it to connect with apps like Uber and Twitter, or Nest thermostats. Suddenly, Echo went from a novelty to a whole ecosystem unto itself.\n\nMeanwhile, Echo plays right into Amazon's core retail business by making it \"frictionless\" to buy things, Goertz says. Indeed, Goertz says that he hasn't been to the grocery store in three months because he's made all his food purchases on Amazon via shouts at Alexa.\n\nThe overall play for Amazon, says Forrester Principal Analyst Thomas Husson, is to continue to make Alexa more useful with more smart home integration and more media capabilities. Why? The more people use Alexa devices, the more likely they are to spend money on Amazon. And so, unlike many rivals, it can afford to take a loss on the gadgets.\n\n\"Amazon will increasingly subsidize Echo by bundling content (think music, video) with the device,\" Husson says. \"They can afford this since this is not core to their business model: the end-goal is to facilitate interactions.\"\n\nAnd not only does Echo encourage you to shop more, Husson notes, but it also feeds more data back into Amazon's all-important recommendation machine, so the website and apps can, again, encourage you to buy more.\n\nWhere Google can compete with Alexa\n\nGoogle has two key advantages over Amazon as it pushes its Google Assistant strategy.\n\nFirst, \"Google benefits from its huge search inventory, and has invested for longer in machine learning than its rivals,\" notes Forrester's Husson. The search giant is better than anyone else at, well, search. And it's better at delivering answers to questions, which is basically the major thing a voice assistant needs to do.\n\nSecond, there are estimated to be over 1.5 billion Android users out there in the world, all of whom have phones that could theoretically get upgraded with Google Assistant (whether they will or not is a different story). Plus, Assistant is built into Google Allo, the company's latest messaging app, and Google Pixel, the company's flagship phone.\n\nThese are both things Amazon presently struggles with. In Business Insider's own tests, Google Assistant outmaneuvers Alexa and the other voice assistants when it comes to performing everyday tasks. And while Amazon's Alexa is only now starting to appear on phones and TVs, Google's Android is everywhere.\n\nThough it's not entirely yet clear how the Google Home or the Assistant will play into Google's advertising-driven model, it's important that they keep with this market until it bears fruit. \"For them, this is vital since this is simply about the future of search,\" says Husson.\n\nWhere Microsoft can compete with Alexa\n\nThe strategy, Microsoft recently explained to Business Insider, is to make its Cortana virtual assistant the voice agent of choice for businesses and busy professionals.\n\nLike Google, Microsoft has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence, and boasts some of the most advanced technologies for having human-like conversations with virtual agents like its own Cortana, which comes with every installation of Windows 10.\n\nBut Microsoft has a special ity all its own: It's been the dominant player in business productivity software for the last several decades, with deep hooks into Microsoft Office, Microsoft Dynamics sales software, and soon, the LinkedIn professional social network.\n\nAnd because of that dominance, it has relationships with companies like Nissan and Volkswagen, both of whom are embedding Microsoft technologies in their cars. Nissan is even going so far to embed Cortana in the dashboards of its next-gen cars. Microsoft sees Cortana as helping you be productive anywhere, even in the car where your hands aren't free.\n\nMicrosoft has its own challenge, though. While Microsoft's Cortana is starting to come to outside devices, including Nissan cars and a Harman Kardon-manufactured Echo-like speaker, it's still primarily on Windows 10 devices. And as of September 2016, there are only 400 million of those, compared to the billion-plus of Apple iOS and Android.\n\nWhy Apple needs to get started now\n\n\"[Apple has] all the pieces of the puzzle: an installed base of more than one billion devices, Apple Music, Beats, Siri, et cetera,\" says Forrester's Husson. \"They could very well combine these and deliver a more intuitive user interface.\"\n\nAnd yet, the clock is ticking for the most valuable company in the world, as the aggressive moves made by the other major players could squeeze Apple out before it even has a chance to get in the game.\n\n\"The room for Apple to enter the space gets smaller and smaller every day,\" says Gartner's Goertz.\n\nLook at it this way: If you buy a new fridge that has Amazon Alexa built in, you're probably not going to even look at competing virtual assistants until it's time to replace it. Otherwise, you run the risk of your fridge not talking to your smart bulbs, or not talking to your home security system. Or at least, you'd have multiple voice assistants talking at you across your house, which could get annoying.\n\nIn that situation, \"Alexa has you locked in for the next several years,\" Goertz says.\n\nMeanwhile, the promise of Apple's own HomeKit connected home solution is still \"underdeveloped\" and \"not that cohesive,\" Goertz says, encouraging customers and smart home vendors alike to look elsewhere. And while the company has pitched the Apple TV as the hub of the smart home, thanks to its Siri integration, it's less convenient than the always-on Amazon Echo or Google Home experience.\n\nStill, Husson is optimistic: \"Apple is rarely a first entrant into a market, but they could well create a differentiated experience like they did for touchscreens,\" he says.", "Tech-savvy rightwingers have been able to ‘game’ the algorithms of internet giants and create a new reality where Hitler is a good guy, Jews are evil and… Donald Trump becomes president\n\nHere’s what you don’t want to do late on a Sunday night. You do not want to type seven letters into Google. That’s all I did. I typed: “a-r-e”. And then “j-e-w-s”. Since 2008, Google has attempted to predict what question you might be asking and offers you a choice. And this is what it did. It offered me a choice of potential questions it thought I might want to ask: “are jews a race?”, “are jews white?”, “are jews christians?”, and finally, “are jews evil?”\n\nAre Jews evil? It’s not a question I’ve ever thought of asking. I hadn’t gone looking for it. But there it was. I press enter. A page of results appears. This was Google’s question. And this was Google’s answer: Jews are evil. Because there, on my screen, was the proof: an entire page of results, nine out of 10 of which “confirm” this. The top result, from a site called Listovative, has the headline: “Top 10 Major Reasons Why People Hate Jews.” I click on it: “Jews today have taken over marketing, militia, medicinal, technological, media, industrial, cinema challenges etc and continue to face the worlds [sic] envy through unexplained success stories given their inglorious past and vermin like repression all over Europe.”\n\nGoogle is search. It’s the verb, to Google. It’s what we all do, all the time, whenever we want to know anything. We Google it. The site handles at least 63,000 searches a second, 5.5bn a day. Its mission as a company, the one-line overview that has informed the company since its foundation and is still the banner headline on its corporate website today, is to “organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”. It strives to give you the best, most relevant results. And in this instance the third-best, most relevant result to the search query “are Jews… ” is a link to an article from stormfront.org, a neo-Nazi website. The fifth is a YouTube video: “Why the Jews are Evil. Why we are against them.”\n\nThe sixth is from Yahoo Answers: “Why are Jews so evil?” The seventh result is: “Jews are demonic souls from a different world.” And the 10th is from jesus-is-saviour.com: “Judaism is Satanic!”\n\nThere’s one result in the 10 that offers a different point of view. It’s a link to a rather dense, scholarly book review from thetabletmag.com, a Jewish magazine, with the unfortunately misleading headline: “Why Literally Everybody In the World Hates Jews.”\n\nI feel like I’ve fallen down a wormhole, entered some parallel universe where black is white, and good is bad. Though later, I think that perhaps what I’ve actually done is scraped the topsoil off the surface of 2016 and found one of the underground springs that has been quietly nurturing it. It’s been there all the time, of course. Just a few keystrokes away… on our laptops, our tablets, our phones. This isn’t a secret Nazi cell lurking in the shadows. It’s hiding in plain sight.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Are women… Google’s search results.\n\nStories about fake news on Facebook have dominated certain sections of the press for weeks following the American presidential election, but arguably this is even more powerful, more insidious. Frank Pasquale, professor of law at the University of Maryland, and one of the leading academic figures calling for tech companies to be more open and transparent, calls the results “very profound, very troubling”.\n\nHe came across a similar instance in 2006 when, “If you typed ‘Jew’ in Google, the first result was jewwatch.org. It was ‘look out for these awful Jews who are ruining your life’. And the Anti-Defamation League went after them and so they put an asterisk next to it which said: ‘These search results may be disturbing but this is an automated process.’ But what you’re showing – and I’m very glad you are documenting it and screenshotting it – is that despite the fact they have vastly researched this problem, it has gotten vastly worse.”\n\nAnd ordering of search results does influence people, says Martin Moore, director of the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King’s College, London, who has written at length on the impact of the big tech companies on our civic and political spheres. “There’s large-scale, statistically significant research into the impact of search results on political views. And the way in which you see the results and the types of results you see on the page necessarily has an impact on your perspective.” Fake news, he says, has simply “revealed a much bigger problem. These companies are so powerful and so committed to disruption. They thought they were disrupting politics but in a positive way. They hadn’t thought about the downsides. These tools offer remarkable empowerment, but there’s a dark side to it. It enables people to do very cynical, damaging things.”\n\nGoogle is knowledge. It’s where you go to find things out. And evil Jews are just the start of it. There are also evil women. I didn’t go looking for them either. This is what I type: “a-r-e w-o-m-e-n”. And Google offers me just two choices, the first of which is: “Are women evil?” I press return. Yes, they are. Every one of the 10 results “confirms” that they are, including the top one, from a site called sheddingoftheego.com, which is boxed out and highlighted: “Every woman has some degree of prostitute in her. Every woman has a little evil in her… Women don’t love men, they love what they can do for them. It is within reason to say women feel attraction but they cannot love men.”\n\nNext I type: “a-r-e m-u-s-l-i-m-s”. And Google suggests I should ask: “Are Muslims bad?” And here’s what I find out: yes, they are. That’s what the top result says and six of the others. Without typing anything else, simply putting the cursor in the search box, Google offers me two new searches and I go for the first, “Islam is bad for society”. In the next list of suggestions, I’m offered: “Islam must be destroyed.”\n\nThis is the equivalent of going into a library and asking a librarian about Judaism and being handed 10 books of hate Danny Sullivan\n\nJews are evil. Muslims need to be eradicated. And Hitler? Do you want to know about Hitler? Let’s Google it. “Was Hitler bad?” I type. And here’s Google’s top result: “10 Reasons Why Hitler Was One Of The Good Guys” I click on the link: “He never wanted to kill any Jews”; “he cared about conditions for Jews in the work camps”; “he implemented social and cultural reform.” Eight out of the other 10 search results agree: Hitler really wasn’t that bad.\n\nA few days later, I talk to Danny Sullivan, the founding editor of SearchEngineLand.com. He’s been recommended to me by several academics as one of the most knowledgeable experts on search. Am I just being naive, I ask him? Should I have known this was out there? “No, you’re not being naive,” he says. “This is awful. It’s horrible. It’s the equivalent of going into a library and asking a librarian about Judaism and being handed 10 books of hate. Google is doing a horrible, horrible job of delivering answers here. It can and should do better.”\n\nHe’s surprised too. “I thought they stopped offering autocomplete suggestions for religions in 2011.” And then he types “are women” into his own computer. “Good lord! That answer at the top. It’s a featured result. It’s called a “direct answer”. This is supposed to be indisputable. It’s Google’s highest endorsement.” That every women has some degree of prostitute in her? “Yes. This is Google’s algorithm going terribly wrong.”\n\nI contacted Google about its seemingly malfunctioning autocomplete suggestions and received the following response: “Our search results are a reflection of the content across the web. This means that sometimes unpleasant portrayals of sensitive subject matter online can affect what search results appear for a given query. These results don’t reflect Google’s own opinions or beliefs – as a company, we strongly value a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures.”\n\nGoogle isn’t just a search engine, of course. Search was the foundation of the company but that was just the beginning. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, now has the greatest concentration of artificial intelligence experts in the world. It is expanding into healthcare, transportation, energy. It’s able to attract the world’s top computer scientists, physicists and engineers. It’s bought hundreds of start-ups, including Calico, whose stated mission is to “cure death” and DeepMind, which aims to “solve intelligence”.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2002. Photograph: Michael Grecco/Getty Images\n\nAnd 20 years ago it didn’t even exist. When Tony Blair became prime minister, it wasn’t possible to Google him: the search engine had yet to be invented. The company was only founded in 1998 and Facebook didn’t appear until 2004. Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are still only 43. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook is 32. Everything they’ve done, the world they’ve remade, has been done in the blink of an eye.\n\nBut it seems the implications about the power and reach of these companies is only now seeping into the public consciousness. I ask Rebecca MacKinnon, director of the Ranking Digital Rights project at the New America Foundation, whether it was the recent furore over fake news that woke people up to the danger of ceding our rights as citizens to corporations. “It’s kind of weird right now,” she says, “because people are finally saying, ‘Gee, Facebook and Google really have a lot of power’ like it’s this big revelation. And it’s like, ‘D’oh.’”\n\nMacKinnon has a particular expertise in how authoritarian governments adapt to the internet and bend it to their purposes. “China and Russia are a cautionary tale for us. I think what happens is that it goes back and forth. So during the Arab spring, it seemed like the good guys were further ahead. And now it seems like the bad guys are. Pro-democracy activists are using the internet more than ever but at the same time, the adversary has gotten so much more skilled.”\n\nLast week Jonathan Albright, an assistant professor of communications at Elon University in North Carolina, published the first detailed research on how rightwing websites had spread their message. “I took a list of these fake news sites that was circulating, I had an initial list of 306 of them and I used a tool – like the one Google uses – to scrape them for links and then I mapped them. So I looked at where the links went – into YouTube and Facebook, and between each other, millions of them… and I just couldn’t believe what I was seeing.\n\n“They have created a web that is bleeding through on to our web. This isn’t a conspiracy. There isn’t one person who’s created this. It’s a vast system of hundreds of different sites that are using all the same tricks that all websites use. They’re sending out thousands of links to other sites and together this has created a vast satellite system of rightwing news and propaganda that has completely surrounded the mainstream media system.”\n\nHe found 23,000 pages and 1.3m hyperlinks. “And Facebook is just the amplification device. When you look at it in 3D, it actually looks like a virus. And Facebook was just one of the hosts for the virus that helps it spread faster. You can see the New York Times in there and the Washington Post and then you can see how there’s a vast, vast network surrounding them. The best way of describing it is as an ecosystem. This really goes way beyond individual sites or individual stories. What this map shows is the distribution network and you can see that it’s surrounding and actually choking the mainstream news ecosystem.”\n\nLike a cancer? “Like an organism that is growing and getting stronger all the time.”\n\nCharlie Beckett, a professor in the school of media and communications at LSE, tells me: “We’ve been arguing for some time now that plurality of news media is good. Diversity is good. Critiquing the mainstream media is good. But now… it’s gone wildly out of control. What Jonathan Albright’s research has shown is that this isn’t a byproduct of the internet. And it’s not even being done for commercial reasons. It’s motivated by ideology, by people who are quite deliberately trying to destabilise the internet.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A spatial map of the rightwing fake news ecosystem. Jonathan Albright, assistant professor of communications at Elon University, North Carolina, “scraped” 300 fake news sites (the dark shapes on this map) to reveal the 1.3m hyperlinks that connect them together and link them into the mainstream news ecosystem. Here, Albright shows it is a “vast satellite system of rightwing news and propaganda that has completely surrounded the mainstream media system”. Photograph: Jonathan Albright\n\nAlbright’s map also provides a clue to understanding the Google search results I found. What these rightwing news sites have done, he explains, is what most commercial websites try to do. They try to find the tricks that will move them up Google’s PageRank system. They try and “game” the algorithm. And what his map shows is how well they’re doing that.\n\nThat’s what my searches are showing too. That the right has colonised the digital space around these subjects – Muslims, women, Jews, the Holocaust, black people – far more effectively than the liberal left.\n\n“It’s an information war,” says Albright. “That’s what I keep coming back to.”\n\nBut it’s where it goes from here that’s truly frightening. I ask him how it can be stopped. “I don’t know. I’m not sure it can be. It’s a network. It’s far more powerful than any one actor.”\n\nSo, it’s almost got a life of its own? “Yes, and it’s learning. Every day, it’s getting stronger.”\n\nThe more people who search for information about Jews, the more people will see links to hate sites, and the more they click on those links (very few people click on to the second page of results) the more traffic the sites will get, the more links they will accrue and the more authoritative they will appear. This is an entirely circular knowledge economy that has only one outcome: an amplification of the message. Jews are evil. Women are evil. Islam must be destroyed. Hitler was one of the good guys.\n\nFake news and a 400-year-old problem: we need to resolve the ‘post-truth’ crisis Read more\n\nAnd the constellation of websites that Albright found – a sort of shadow internet – has another function. More than just spreading rightwing ideology, they are being used to track and monitor and influence anyone who comes across their content. “I scraped the trackers on these sites and I was absolutely dumbfounded. Every time someone likes one of these posts on Facebook or visits one of these websites, the scripts are then following you around the web. And this enables data-mining and influencing companies like Cambridge Analytica to precisely target individuals, to follow them around the web, and to send them highly personalised political messages. This is a propaganda machine. It’s targeting people individually to recruit them to an idea. It’s a level of social engineering that I’ve never seen before. They’re capturing people and then keeping them on an emotional leash and never letting them go.”\n\nCambridge Analytica, an American-owned company based in London, was employed by both the Vote Leave campaign and the Trump campaign. Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of Vote Leave, has made few public announcements since the Brexit referendum but he did say this: “If you want to make big improvements in communication, my advice is – hire physicists.”\n\nSteve Bannon, founder of Breitbart News and the newly appointed chief strategist to Trump, is on Cambridge Analytica’s board and it has emerged that the company is in talks to undertake political messaging work for the Trump administration. It claims to have built psychological profiles using 5,000 separate pieces of data on 220 million American voters. It knows their quirks and nuances and daily habits and can target them individually.\n\n“They were using 40-50,000 different variants of ad every day that were continuously measuring responses and then adapting and evolving based on that response,” says Martin Moore of Kings College. Because they have so much data on individuals and they use such phenomenally powerful distribution networks, they allow campaigns to bypass a lot of existing laws.\n\n“It’s all done completely opaquely and they can spend as much money as they like on particular locations because you can focus on a five-mile radius or even a single demographic. Fake news is important but it’s only one part of it. These companies have found a way of transgressing 150 years of legislation that we’ve developed to make elections fair and open.”\n\nDid such micro-targeted propaganda – currently legal – swing the Brexit vote? We have no way of knowing. Did the same methods used by Cambridge Analytica help Trump to victory? Again, we have no way of knowing. This is all happening in complete darkness. We have no way of knowing how our personal data is being mined and used to influence us. We don’t realise that the Facebook page we are looking at, the Google page, the ads that we are seeing, the search results we are using, are all being personalised to us. We don’t see it because we have nothing to compare it to. And it is not being monitored or recorded. It is not being regulated. We are inside a machine and we simply have no way of seeing the controls. Most of the time, we don’t even realise that there are controls.\n\nFacebook and Google move to kick fake news sites off their ad networks Read more\n\nRebecca MacKinnon says that most of us consider the internet to be like “the air that we breathe and the water that we drink”. It surrounds us. We use it. And we don’t question it. “But this is not a natural landscape. Programmers and executives and editors and designers, they make this landscape. They are human beings and they all make choices.”\n\nBut we don’t know what choices they are making. Neither Google or Facebook make their algorithms public. Why did my Google search return nine out of 10 search results that claim Jews are evil? We don’t know and we have no way of knowing. Their systems are what Frank Pasquale describes as “black boxes”. He calls Google and Facebook “a terrifying duopoly of power” and has been leading a growing movement of academics who are calling for “algorithmic accountability”. “We need to have regular audits of these systems,” he says. “We need people in these companies to be accountable. In the US, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, every company has to have a spokesman you can reach. And this is what needs to happen. They need to respond to complaints about hate speech, about bias.”\n\nIs bias built into the system? Does it affect the kind of results that I was seeing? “There’s all sorts of bias about what counts as a legitimate source of information and how that’s weighted. There’s enormous commercial bias. And when you look at the personnel, they are young, white and perhaps Asian, but not black or Hispanic and they are overwhelmingly men. The worldview of young wealthy white men informs all these judgments.”\n\nLater, I speak to Robert Epstein, a research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioural Research and Technology, and the author of the study that Martin Moore told me about (and that Google has publicly criticised), showing how search-rank results affect voting patterns. On the other end of the phone, he repeats one of the searches I did. He types “do blacks…” into Google.\n\n“Look at that. I haven’t even hit a button and it’s automatically populated the page with answers to the query: ‘Do blacks commit more crimes?’ And look, I could have been going to ask all sorts of questions. ‘Do blacks excel at sports’, or anything. And it’s only given me two choices and these aren’t simply search-based or the most searched terms right now. Google used to use that but now they use an algorithm that looks at other things. Now, let me look at Bing and Yahoo. I’m on Yahoo and I have 10 suggestions, not one of which is ‘Do black people commit more crime?’\n\n“And people don’t question this. Google isn’t just offering a suggestion. This is a negative suggestion and we know that negative suggestions depending on lots of things can draw between five and 15 more clicks. And this all programmed. And it could be programmed differently.”\n\nWhat Epstein’s work has shown is that the contents of a page of search results can influence people’s views and opinions. The type and order of search rankings was shown to influence voters in India in double-blind trials. There were similar results relating to the search suggestions you are offered.\n\n“The general public are completely in the dark about very fundamental issues regarding online search and influence. We are talking about the most powerful mind-control machine ever invented in the history of the human race. And people don’t even notice it.”\n\nGood luck in making Google reveal its algorithm | John Naughton Read more\n\nDamien Tambini, an associate professor at the London School of Economics, who focuses on media regulation, says that we lack any sort of framework to deal with the potential impact of these companies on the democratic process. “We have structures that deal with powerful media corporations. We have competition laws. But these companies are not being held responsible. There are no powers to get Google or Facebook to disclose anything. There’s an editorial function to Google and Facebook but it’s being done by sophisticated algorithms. They say it’s machines not editors. But that’s simply a mechanised editorial function.”\n\nAnd the companies, says John Naughton, the Observer columnist and a senior research fellow at Cambridge University, are terrified of acquiring editorial responsibilities they don’t want. “Though they can and regularly do tweak the results in all sorts of ways.”\n\nCertainly the results about Google on Google don’t seem entirely neutral. Google “Is Google racist?” and the featured result – the Google answer boxed out at the top of the page – is quite clear: no. It is not.\n\nGoogle and Facebook are thinking long term. They have the resources, money and ambition to do whatever they want John Naughton\n\nBut the enormity and complexity of having two global companies of a kind we have never seen before influencing so many areas of our lives is such, says Naughton, that “we don’t even have the mental apparatus to even know what the problems are”.\n\nAnd this is especially true of the future. Google and Facebook are at the forefront of AI. They are going to own the future. And the rest of us can barely start to frame the sorts of questions we ought to be asking. “Politicians don’t think long term. And corporations don’t think long term because they’re focused on the next quarterly results and that’s what makes Google and Facebook interesting and different. They are absolutely thinking long term. They have the resources, the money, and the ambition to do whatever they want.\n\n“They want to digitise every book in the world: they do it. They want to build a self-driving car: they do it. The fact that people are reading about these fake news stories and realising that this could have an effect on politics and elections, it’s like, ‘Which planet have you been living on?’ For Christ’s sake, this is obvious.”\n\n“The internet is among the few things that humans have built that they don’t understand.” It is “the largest experiment involving anarchy in history. Hundreds of millions of people are, each minute, creating and consuming an untold amount of digital content in an online world that is not truly bound by terrestrial laws.” The internet as a lawless anarchic state? A massive human experiment with no checks and balances and untold potential consequences? What kind of digital doom-mongerer would say such a thing? Step forward, Eric Schmidt – Google’s chairman. They are the first lines of the book, The New Digital Age, that he wrote with Jared Cohen.\n\nWe don’t understand it. It is not bound by terrestrial laws. And it’s in the hands of two massive, all-powerful corporations. It’s their experiment, not ours. The technology that was supposed to set us free may well have helped Trump to power, or covertly helped swing votes for Brexit. It has created a vast network of propaganda that has encroached like a cancer across the entire internet. This is a technology that has enabled the likes of Cambridge Analytica to create political messages uniquely tailored to you. They understand your emotional responses and how to trigger them. They know your likes, dislikes, where you live, what you eat, what makes you laugh, what makes you cry.\n\nAnd what next? Rebecca MacKinnon’s research has shown how authoritarian regimes reshape the internet for their own purposes. Is that what’s going to happen with Silicon Valley and Trump? As Martin Moore points out, the president-elect claimed that Apple chief executive Tim Cook called to congratulate him soon after his election victory. “And there will undoubtedly be be pressure on them to collaborate,” says Moore.\n\nJournalism is failing in the face of such change and is only going to fail further. New platforms have put a bomb under the financial model – advertising – resources are shrinking, traffic is increasingly dependent on them, and publishers have no access, no insight at all, into what these platforms are doing in their headquarters, their labs. And now they are moving beyond the digital world into the physical. The next frontiers are healthcare, transportation, energy. And just as Google is a near-monopoly for search, its ambition to own and control the physical infrastructure of our lives is what’s coming next. It already owns our data and with it our identity. What will it mean when it moves into all the other areas of our lives?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg: still only 32 years of age. Photograph: Mariana Bazo/Reuters\n\n“At the moment, there’s a distance when you Google ‘Jews are’ and get ‘Jews are evil’,” says Julia Powles, a researcher at Cambridge on technology and law. “But when you move into the physical realm, and these concepts become part of the tools being deployed when you navigate around your city or influence how people are employed, I think that has really pernicious consequences.”\n\nPowles is shortly to publish a paper looking at DeepMind’s relationship with the NHS. “A year ago, 2 million Londoners’ NHS health records were handed over to DeepMind. And there was complete silence from politicians, from regulators, from anyone in a position of power. This is a company without any healthcare experience being given unprecedented access into the NHS and it took seven months to even know that they had the data. And that took investigative journalism to find it out.”\n\nThe headline was that DeepMind was going to work with the NHS to develop an app that would provide early warning for sufferers of kidney disease. And it is, but DeepMind’s ambitions – “to solve intelligence” – goes way beyond that. The entire history of 2 million NHS patients is, for artificial intelligence researchers, a treasure trove. And, their entry into the NHS – providing useful services in exchange for our personal data – is another massive step in their power and influence in every part of our lives.\n\nBecause the stage beyond search is prediction. Google wants to know what you want before you know yourself. “That’s the next stage,” says Martin Moore. “We talk about the omniscience of these tech giants, but that omniscience takes a huge step forward again if they are able to predict. And that’s where they want to go. To predict diseases in health. It’s really, really problematic.”\n\nFor the nearly 20 years that Google has been in existence, our view of the company has been inflected by the youth and liberal outlook of its founders. Ditto Facebook, whose mission, Zuckberg said, was not to be “a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission to make the world more open and connected.”\n\nThe more we argue with them, the more they know about us. It all feeds into a circular system Jonathan Albright\n\nIt would be interesting to know how he thinks that’s working out. Donald Trump is connecting through exactly the same technology platforms that supposedly helped fuel the Arab spring; connecting to racists and xenophobes. And Facebook and Google are amplifying and spreading that message. And us too – the mainstream media. Our outrage is just another node on Jonathan Albright’s data map.\n\n“The more we argue with them, the more they know about us,” he says. “It all feeds into a circular system. What we’re seeing here is new era of network propaganda.”\n\nWe are all points on that map. And our complicity, our credulity, being consumers not concerned citizens, is an essential part of that process. And what happens next is down to us. “I would say that everybody has been really naive and we need to reset ourselves to a much more cynical place and proceed on that basis,” is Rebecca MacKinnon’s advice. “There is no doubt that where we are now is a very bad place. But it’s we as a society who have jointly created this problem. And if we want to get to a better place, when it comes to having an information ecosystem that serves human rights and democracy instead of destroying it, we have to share responsibility for that.”\n\nAre Jews evil? How do you want that question answered? This is our internet. Not Google’s. Not Facebook’s. Not rightwing propagandists. And we’re the only ones who can reclaim it.", "Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Recode by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an Executive Editor at The Verge and Editor at Large of Recode.\n\nLike many tech enthusiasts, I’ve been using a $180 Amazon Echo intelligent speaker at my home for a year or more. And, while I love using it for some things — playing music and podcasts, setting timers, and re-ordering items from Amazon — I’ve come to realize that, like Apple’s Siri and all other virtual assistants, its Alexa voice-driven artificial intelligence system disappoints a lot.\n\nSo I was excited to test Google Home, the $129 Echo competitor that puts the search giant’s much-touted new Google Assistant intelligence technology inside a small, but powerful Echo-like speaker and microphone unit. Surely, I thought, after collecting all that info about the world (and about me) for years and years, Google would crush Amazon in the home-intelligence race.\n\nBut after nearly a week of using two Google Home units in two different rooms, my conclusions are decidedly mixed. Google Home does beat Alexa and the Echo in some ways, but it’s remarkably dumb in others. It needs enough work that, if I were Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, I wouldn’t be losing any sleep about it, at least not yet.\n\nReally? It looks so good!\n\nIn my opinion, and, more importantly, that of my wife (whose taste is much better than mine and whose tech addiction much less) the Google Home looks a lot better than the Echo. While the Echo is a tall black metal cylinder, Google’s contender is a smaller, more stylish, white plastic cylinder with an angled top and a mesh speaker base. You can get alternate bases in different colors. The top is touch sensitive, and has built-in lights that show when the Home is ready to accept a command. It snaps to attention when it hears the trigger phrases “OK, Google” or “Hey, Google”. (The Echo’s trigger phrase can be set to simply “Alexa”, “Echo” or “Amazon”.) You can raise or lower the volume, or pause or resume something, using voice commands. Or you can control the volume by tracing a circle on the top and play / pause by gently tapping it.\n\nI were Jeff Bezos, I wouldn’t be losing any sleep about Google Home\n\nI ran into some glitches with setup, which is performed using an Android or iOS app called Google Home. My first unit wouldn’t recognize my Wi-Fi network and I had to use a temporary workaround to get connected. Google said that might be because I was using an Eero router system. It says it has seen issues with Eero and is working to resolve them. The Echo just a few inches away had no problem with the Eero Wi-Fi and neither did the Google Pixel phone or iPhone I was using, also within inches of the Google Home.\n\nIn the case of both Google Home units, the app reported trouble completing an initial update of the device. Google says it believes this was a bug which it will fix.\n\nIt’s not OK, Google. There’s an election going on!\n\nIn my tests, it was often a toss-up as to whether the Google Assistant or Alexa would do better.\n\nFor instance, when I asked “who’s running for president?”, Home listed the two main third-party candidates as well as the major-party nominees; the Echo left out Gary Johnson and Jill Stein.\n\nBut when I asked Google Home, in four different ways, to give me the latest election polls, it answered “Sorry, I can’t help with that yet, but my team’s helping me learn,” the device’s go-to excuse. The Echo piped right up with the latest average of polls from the respected site RealClearPolitics. Google says that, by election day next week, Home will be able to say who’s won or who’s winning for president, via a variety of queries — but that seems a tad late.\n\nGoogle Home currently only supports a single Google account\n\nGoogle Home knew the address of my office. The Echo told me either the address of the nearest post office, or, when I asked using the words “work address”, said it couldn’t help. But, while Google Home couldn’t give me any info about my calendar (which is kept on Google Calendar, but via a different account), the Echo knew all about it. (Google Home currently only supports a single Google account. I chose my personal account, which contains most of my search data. Google says it’s working on enabling multiple accounts.)\n\nLincoln vs. Lipitor\n\nWhen I asked “where is the nearest pharmacy?” (a question suggested for reviewers by Google), Google Home was dumb. It listed three. One was the correct answer (a CVS) — but with the wrong address. A second was the clinic inside the same drugstore, which isn’t a pharmacy. The third was a nearby supermarket that lacks a pharmacy. The Echo gave me the CVS and also the nearest Walgreens, plus two smaller ones.\n\nGoogle Home couldn’t take a note or set a reminder, like the Echo can. Google says it’s working on adding that.\n\nThe Home’s speaker is a bit fuzzy\n\nOn the other hand, Google Home carried on a conversation with me about Abraham Lincoln, telling me first when he was born, and then answering several other queries about him without requiring me to repeat his name. The Echo couldn’t do this. Home gave a detailed answer to the question of when Jimmy Fallon was in the cast of Saturday Night Live, while the Echo had no idea.\n\nFor playing music, Google mostly did well. Home supports Spotify and Pandora, but I set it to rely on Google’s own Google Play and YouTube services. It handled even my hand-crafted playlists fine. But it occasionally stopped playing a song for a few seconds and then resumed.\n\nWhile the sound from Home was quite good, my wife and I preferred the Echo’s sound slightly, both for music and voices. The Echo’s speaker was crisper, the Home’s a tiny bit fuzzy, to our ears. Also, on at least one album (the “Sleepless in Seattle” soundtrack), Home repeatedly declined to play more than one song, while the Echo played them all.\n\nLike the Echo, Google Home can control some third-party smart home devices, but I couldn’t test this, as I have decided not to help bring down the internet by owning such devices.\n\nVideo via voice\n\nHome is much less versatile than Echo, because it lacks the thousands of third-party apps (or “skills”) that the latter boasts. But it has its own special trick: it can, via a voice command, allow you to cast streaming videos or programs to your TV, provided you have one of Google’s Chromecast devices. For now, these videos have to come from Google’s own YouTube service, but the company says Netflix and others are coming.\n\nThe mics aren’t quite as good as the Echo’s\n\nIn my tests, I was able to get all the Saturday Night Live presidential debate parodies to play on my TV using just Google Home and a single voice command. I also used Home to cast rock star music videos, other TV clips and a random YouTube video of a person playing a guitar.\n\nAbout that guitar video: I saw it due to the fact that the dual long-range mics on the Home simply couldn’t grasp the name of my colleague “Lauren Goode” despite repeated attempts (you should watch her YouTube videos anyway.) So I saw other people. I had a handful of other experiences in which the Google Home mics just couldn’t figure out what I was saying.\n\nAt other times they seemed overly sensitive. For instance, if you have two Home units set up, as I did, only the one closest to you is supposed to respond to your voice. I found this generally true, but on two occasions, both units responded. Overall, the mics had very good range and accuracy, even several rooms away, but not quite as good as the 7-mic array on the Amazon product.\n\nIf you do spring for multiple Google Home speakers, you can set them up, via the app, to play the same music in multiple rooms. This worked fine for me. Speaking of the app, it works on both Android and iPhone, and I tested both successfully.\n\nPrivacy\n\nA lot of people might be suspicious about placing a constantly-listening Google device in their homes, since the company is famous for collecting personal information. I asked Google about this, and a person who worked on Google Home swore that it only collects what you say after it hears the trigger phrases. Further, he said, the data goes into the same data store as other information Google collects about you. And, like that information, you can tweak or even delete it at myactivity.google.com.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTo paraphrase Google’s own CEO, Sundar Pichai, artificial intelligence is still in its very early days. And, in my opinion, Google Home shows that. I have no doubt it will improve. But I was surprised that Google Home arrived so rough around the edges, especially when it had an existing competitive product to learn from, and an unmatched wealth of data to draw upon.\n\nLike a dominating batter in a tight World Series game, you kind of expect Google to hit a game-winning homer. But it merely hit a double, and the contest is still very much on.", "Recent cutbacks and turbulence at Alphabet's Google Fiber service are generating speculation about a possible sale or spin off of the business.\n\nNow operating as part of the company Access in Alphabet's \"other bets\" division, the fiber service has recently seen its CEO depart without being replaced, halted expansion in new cities, and laid off almost 10% of its staff.\n\nOn Thursday, that convergence of factors prompted speculation by the tech news web site The Information that Google is likely getting ready to dispose of the service , which was a pioneer in bringing gigabit Internet download speeds to consumers. Telecom operator CenturyLink —which is in the process of buying Level 3 Communications ( lvlt ) for $34 billion —is a \"possible acquirer,\" the web site said without citing a source.\n\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter.\n\nFortune reached out to Google ( googl ) for comment and will update this story if any response is received. CenturyLink ( ctl ) declined to comment.\n\nJust two months ago, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat had defended the project publicly , telling analysts on a quarterly earnings call that the fiber service was \"making great progress\" and remained \"committed to growth\" in its already active markets.\n\nThe likelihood of the speculated sale would depend heavily on the fiber business's financials as there is no obvious reason the unit would be appealing to any buyer. Stringing fiber optic high speed Internet connections to homes around the country is exceedingly expensive—as Google has discovered—and requires competing with deeply entrenched monopoly cable and telephone operators. The service has not reached critical mass in any of the eight scattered markets from Austin to Nashville to Salt Lake City that it has entered in the past six years.\n\nCEO Craig Barratt left in October and has not been replaced. At that time, the unit also reportedly laid off about 130 out of 1,500 workers. A few months prior, the service had announced it was revamping its business model to use more wireless technology as it paused all planned expansions into brand new cities.\n\nGoogle is hardly the first company to run into cost issues while trying to provide consumer Internet and cable TV service, even before the era of high-speed fiber optic connections. Dozens of upstart carriers went bankrupt in the 1990s and early 2000s trying to break into the telecommunications and cable markets.", "Image: Screenshot\n\nWe’re all disappearing under a virtual avalanche of photos and videos, and no one’s really sure about how to organize it all—though Apple and Google keep trying. Android and iOS both have smart photo services built in nowadays, but what happens when you want to jump from one to the other? Here’s what you need to know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this guide we’ll be tackling the challenge of moving your whole photo library from one service to the other: this is a full traded-in-my-iPhone-for-a-Pixel scenario, a clean break where you’re switching from Apple Photos to Google Photos or back the other way.\n\nImage: Google\n\nFor a lot of people it might be better to have a foot in both camps, at least for some photos or for some of the time, but for simplicity’s sake we won’t go into every possible scenario here. You can in fact use these services alongside each other pretty easily, but in this case we’ll tackle going from one to the other wholesale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s also worth noting these are not exactly directly comparable services, with Apple’s photo offerings very much baked into its hardware and software, and Google Photos very much web-first and operating independently of your computers, phones and tablets.\n\nSwitching from Apple Photos to Google Photos\n\nBefore you jump to Google Photos you need to decide if you want to store your photos (and videos) at their original resolution or whether you’re happy to put up with some resizing—images are stored at a maximum of 16 megapixels and videos are stored at a maximum of 1080p HD.\n\nIf you choose the second option, you can store as much as you want, for free. If you want to keep everything as it is, you need to think about paying for Google Drive storage, as you only get 15GB for free. Prices start at 100GB for $1.99 a month.\n\nOnce you’ve decided, you need to work out where your photos are, and given the different apps on macOS and iOS, and the recent upgrades to both, you could be forgiven for not being too sure. Thankfully, Google Photos isn’t too fussed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSponsored\n\nDownload the Google Photos desktop client for macOS and mobile app for iOS and both will get to work picking up all the pictures from your computers and iDevices. The desktop app asks which photo libraries you want to back up when you start it, and the iOS app simply backs up everything it can find.\n\nThe only images and videos that might get missed are those you’ve uploaded to iCloud and deleted from your devices, if you’re using iCloud. To get these files back on macOS, launch Photos, then open the Photos menu, choose Preferences, switch to iCloud and make sure Download Originals to Mac is selected. On iOS, if you have the space, open Settings then tap iCloud, Photos and Download and Keep Originals.\n\nIf for whatever reason you can’t get your iCloud photos back to a Mac or iOS device, the export options from iCloud on the web are a little less than stellar. Pictures can be downloaded individually easily enough, but for bulk downloads you have to use the Shift or Cmd keys to select multiple items at once, then click the download icon. Once saved somewhere, they can be uploaded to Google Photos using a desktop client or just your web browser.\n\nSwitching from Google Photos to Apple Photos\n\nAs we’ve said, Google Photos lives on the web, but getting all your pictures and videos back down again isn’t too difficult—though it might take some time if you’ve got a massive photo library and a sluggish internet connection. With Apple Photos, you don’t have to store your pictures in the cloud, but if you do then you’ll probably need to pay for extra storage.\n\nThe Google Photos desktop client for macOS doesn’t have two-way sync, but the one for Google Drive does. First, go to Google Drive on the web, open the Settings page (via the cog icon) and tick the box marked Automatically put your Google Photos into a folder in My Drive under the General tab.\n\nThat doesn’t change anything about what’s stored in Google Photos, it just makes everything visible in Google Drive. Then, download and install the macOS client for Google Drive, and make sure the Google Photos folder is selected in the list of folders to sync, which will be displayed during the setup process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey presto, all your photos and videos are pulled down from the cloud. In the Photos app on your Mac, pick File then Import to load in the newly downloaded content. It’s only if you don’t have a Mac computer to hand that difficulties arise—if you’re using Apple’s photo services solely on iPhones, iPads, and the web, maybe.\n\nIf you have a Windows machine to hand, you can use the same trick as above to get the images and videos downloaded. Then, instead of running the Photos app on macOS, use iTunes and your iDevice, or just iCloud on the web, to get everything up to the iCloud Photo Library.\n\nAlternatively you can use the Google Takeout service to download all of your pictures and video from Google Photos if you don’t want to go down the Google Drive syncing route. All of your stuff gets served up as a compressed folder which you can then extract and move to Apple’s apps on the desktop, on mobile and in the cloud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA computer of some kind really is essential though as a stopgap between Google Photos and Apple’s Photos apps, even if you’re planning to use nothing but an iPhone and iCloud Photo Library for the rest of your life. In other words you can’t go straight from cloud service to cloud service.\n\nWithout investing too much time and effort you should be up and running on your new photo management system and ready to take and store pictures again—at least until you decide to switch to something new.", "Google has a lot of self-driving cars that have driven a lot of miles, but so far has not used them commercially. That could change if the Silicon Valley giant pursues its rumored plans of developing an autonomous ride-sharing network to compete with Uber and Lyft. Recently, Google filed a patent application that could be seen as the first shot across Uber’s bow.\n\nThe application, first noticed earlier this month by the website Patent Yogi, is for efficiently determining pick-up and destination locations for autonomous vehicles. Google says it wants to operate fully self-driving cars where passengers provide some initial input, such as a pick-up or destination location, and the vehicle maneuvers itself to that location.\n\nefficiently determining locations for autonomous vehicles\n\nBut not all locations are accessible or safe for autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars may not be able to drive everywhere a human driven vehicle can, such as construction zones or lanes only for emergency vehicles.\n\nGoogle aims to address that challenge in its patent application. When provided with a location, Google says a centralized dispatching system would provide a set of suggested locations for safe pick-ups, waiting, or drop-offs. These suggested locations may include those provided by the user and convenient nearby locations. As such, the patented technology increases the “availability, safety, and usefulness of the services of autonomous vehicles,” Google’s application reads.\n\nUber also directs passengers to more convenient pick-up locations, mostly through its carpooling feature and other transit-focused products.\n\nThis isn’t the first patent filed by Google in relation to its self-driving efforts. Last year, the tech company was granted a patent for a unique solution to minimize injuries when a self-driving car strikes a pedestrian. The patent describes \"an adhesive layer positioned on the front end of the vehicle\" that pedestrians will simply stick to \"in the event of a collision” — in other words, human flypaper.\n\nGoogle’s self-driving fleet, operated under its Waymo brand, is still in the testing phase. The company recently announced its plans to deploy its newly developed self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans in Mountain View and Phoenix at the end of January.\n\nRumor has it that Waymo and Chrysler will eventually launch its own autonomous ride-sharing service to compete with the likes of Uber and Lyft, possibly by utilizing Google’s Waze traffic data and mapping service. Indeed, during his remarks at the Detroit auto show last week, Waymo CEO John Krafcik said the company was eyeing a number of products, including ride-hailing, logistics, personal transportation, and last-mile solutions.\n\nReportedly, Google plans to start small by deploying its multi-sized autonomous fleet in confined areas like college campuses, military bases, and corporate office parks. This is smart, because it would likely help Google get additional miles under its belt before rolling out its self-driving cars onto city streets. (I wrote all about the possibilities of a Google-vs-Uber ride-hailing smackdown over a year ago.)\n\nGoogle may deploy its autonomous fleet in confined areas to start out\n\nUber, of course, has its own, smaller fleet of self-driving cars that its been using to pick up and drop off select groups of passengers in Pittsburgh. The company tried to roll out a second test fleet in San Francisco, but was forced to cancel the service after it refused to apply for an autonomous driving permit from the state. Those vehicles were moved to Arizona, where they will soon offer rides to passengers. Lyft is also working on a self-driving ride-hailing service in partnership with investor General Motors.\n\nGoogle and Uber may eventually be in direct competition in the ride-hailing market, but for now, the two Silicon Valley giants are finding new ways to collaborate. Last week, Google announced that the latest version of Google Maps on Android and iOS lets users request a ride from Uber without ever leaving the app. Previously, you could use Maps to check for price estimates and start the process of getting a lift, but eventually you had to finish things up in the Uber app. Now, the entire request process takes place directly in Google Maps.", "Today, Google’s Threat Analysis group disclosed a critical vulnerability in Windows in a public post on the company’s security blog. The bug itself is very specific — allowing attackers to escape from security sandboxes through a flaw in the win32k system — but it’s serious enough to be categorized as critical, and according to Google, it’s being actively exploited. As a result, Google went public just 10 days after reporting the bug to Microsoft, before a patch could be coded and deployed. The result is that, while Google has already deployed a fix to protect Chrome users, Windows itself is still vulnerable — and now, everybody knows it.\n\nGoogle’s disclosure provides only a general description of the bug, giving users enough information to recognize a possible attack without making it too easy for criminals to replicate. Exploiting the bug also depends on a separate exploit in Adobe Flash, for which the company has also released a patch. Still, simply knowing that the bug exists will likely spur a lot of criminals to look for viable ways to exploit it against computers that have yet to update Flash.\n\nFirst reached by VentureBeat, Microsoft harshly criticized the disclosure. “Today’s disclosure by Google puts customers at potential risk,” a Microsoft spokesperson said. “We recommend customers use Windows 10 and the Microsoft Edge browser for the best protection.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft followed up with more detail in a post by Executive VP Terry Myerson. Myerson attributed the exploitation of the bug to a group called Strontium, a Russia-linked group also called Fancy Bear. Myerson emphasized that Windows 10 users browsing with Edge would be protected from the attack, and promised a system-wide patch to be shipped on November 8th.\n\nThe brief grace period is in accordance with a policy Google put in place in 2013, allowing critical vulnerabilities to be disclosed only seven days after they’re reported to the vendor. At the time, a number of researchers criticized the policy as overly harsh, arguing that seven days was not enough time to properly respond to a complex vulnerability. This is the first major invocation of the policy in the three years since it was put in place, although Google’s engineers defended it as necessary given the active exploitation of the bug.\n\n“We encourage users to verify that auto-updaters have already updated Flash — and to manually update if not,” Google’s post recommends, “and to apply Windows patches from Microsoft when they become available.”\n\nUpdate 4:44PM: Updated with more detail from Myerson post.", "An Apple Watch, eh? Fancy! Let’s fire up that wristable the right way.\n\nAssuming your Watch is already on and charged, go ahead and open up the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, the one you’ve tried to delete a few times but iOS wouldn’t let you. You’ll need an iPhone 5 or more recent, running iOS 9 (if you have an Android phone, uh… was there a gift receipt, perhaps?). Make sure you’ve got Bluetooth and Wi-Fi toggled on as well. Select Start Pairing on the Watch, then direct your iPhone’s camera at the pretty blue pattern that has appeared on the Watch’s face. Congrats! They’re now bonded.\n\nIf the automagic process isn’t working, you can also do this manually, by tapping the “i” icon on your Watch and typing the six-digit code it coughs up into your iPhone.\n\nDial in Those Settings\n\nNow that smartwatch and smartphone are one, tap Set Up as New Apple Watch on your iPhone, unless this is somehow your second or third Apple Watch, in which case you should select Restore from Backup, and also maybe pace yourself on the smartwatch purchases. Then choose whether you’ll be wearing the Watch on your right or left wrist, and agree to the terms and conditions.\n\nNext, enter your Apple ID and password (this is all still on your phone, no text input on that tiny display during this process). Then decide whether you want to enable Location Services (yes), Siri (sure), and Diagnostics (meh?). Just keep in mind that your iPhone and Watch will mirror each other with these settings; change it on one device, and the other will as well.\n\nYou’ll then be given the option to create a passcode. You should do this, if only because without one you can’t use Apple Pay, which is currently one of the best parts of Apple Watch ownership. You can also save yourself some annoyances down the line by telling your Apple Watch to unlock along with your iPhone.\n\nAdd Some Apps\n\nAnd now the homestretch! It’s time for apps. You can either click Install All to load up any app on your phone that has Watch capabilities, or you can go with Choose Later to winnow the field down to your chosen few. Honestly, you might as well just install them all and trim from there. Your choice, though! Your Watch!\n\nThat’s basically it; from there you just need to wait for your iPhone and Watch to sync, which can take a good long while. Once they’re all synced up, you should go ahead and fiddle around in the settings, where you can set up Apple Pay (again, the best!), fine-tune your notifications to keep dozens of apps from constantly buzzing your wrist, unless you’re somehow into that. Other settings avenues to walk down? The Activity app, which is the one that tracks your movement throughout the day and tells you to stand up once in a while; the Sounds & Haptics settings, to dictate how loud and long the Watch tries to get your attention, and Glances, which provide bite-sized info from swipe to swipe.\n\nHow you set each of those up is entirely your choice, but you’ll probably be happier if you don’t just leave it up to stock.\n\nAnd that’s it! You’re now officially a Watch person. Don’t let it go to your wrist.", "It looks like the last picture show for one of Google’s efforts at expanding into more detailed vertical search pages. Without much notice, the search giant has closed down its standalone movie site where people were able to search for cinemas, films and show times on a particular date and near a specific location, rolling some of the functionality directly into its main search portal. “Google Showtimes”, as the service was called, now brings up a 404 error if you try to visit its main page.\n\nThe “about” description, however, linked above, provides the following message:\n\n“Google Showtimes was discontinued on 1 November 2016. You can now discover show times on the search results page by searching for the name of the movie that you want to see or try searching for the word ‘movies’ to discover what’s in cinemas.”\n\nA spokesperson declined to comment further about the closure and whether it was part of one of Google’s recurring spring cleaning (or autumn cleaning, as the case may be) service closures.\n\nIt’s not clear why Google decided to shut the separate portal but there are some signs that Google Showtimes what not much of a blockbuster for the company, and perhaps even ran counter to how Google sees some of its bigger developments in search and media.\n\nGoogle’s movie portal looks like it first went live in some form in the autumn of 2005, and as you can see from a screenshot from October 2016 below, it never updated much beyond its interface based around Google’s original, very simple, pared-down aesthetics in its original search experience.\n\nThis was actually a good thing, it seems, as groups of (now former) users on Google’s product forums, Reddit, and elsewhere who are complaining about the closure note the contrast with competing services from the likes of Fandango and Movietickets — which, may look more snappy but are less useful for finding cinemas and films based on specific locations and times that might not be exactly where you are at that precise moment.\n\nThose users now appear ready to throw their popcorn at Google for retiring Google Showtimes and funneling some of the features into Google.com, which presents basic results like this when I search for a theater or film here in the UK at Google.com:\n\nIt looks like Google didn’t do much in the way of selling ads against Showtimes, meaning that the traffic that was resulting from it, such as it was, didn’t necessarily convert to revenue for the company.\n\nGoogle Showtimes somewhat went against bigger trends in the film industry, which is bracing itself for another tough year where cinemas are concerned. Box office ticket sales for 2016 are on track to be the worst in a century, according to Vanity Fair.\n\nGoogle Showtimes also stood separate from the wider industry trend for streaming and Google’s own ambitions to become a platform for distributing and consuming video, coming as it did a full year before the acquisition of YouTube (and many years before services like Android TV).\n\nInstead, Google Showtimes appeared to germinate more from the company’s strategy to expand into more vertical search categories, providing landing places for people who are going to the web to look for specific information and choosing specific portals to get there, rather than Google’s catch-all Google.com, a trend that has grown with the rise of smartphone use, where people want fewer steps between looking for something and arriving at an answer.\n\nThat effort has resulted in the building of an extensive mapping product, Google Maps, but also portals like Google Flights for plane ticket searches and Google Finance for financial news and data. It may be that while Google is still working on new search experiences beyond Google.com, they are more likely to be based around other vertical definitions (like mobile, location, and so on) than Google might have originally conceived.\n\nIndeed, Google Showtimes is not the first vertical portal that Google has shut down. Google’s hotel finder now lives within Maps, rather than as a separate site.", "Does the world need another messaging app? Google says yes. And it believes its Allo messaging app is different enough to compete against Apple's iMessage, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and all the rest. That's because it's the first to include Google Assistant, which I can only describe as a mega chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to bring you answers in a conversational manner.\n\nAvailable as a free download today on Android and iOS, Allo was first introduced during Google I/O in conjunction with Google's web-calling app Duo (which, since launching a month ago, has now reached 10 million downloads on Android).\n\nThough it sends and receives messages as well as the others, Allo has its own promising features that I found useful. Read on to see what makes Allo stand out and if it has what it takes to be your new chat app.\n\nGoogle Assistant: The ultimate bot\n\nAllo's standout feature is Google Assistant, which is basically a bot you can chat with that uses Google's vast search database to answer several kinds of questions you throw its way. For example, you can type, \"Cafes nearby?\" and it will find popular coffee shops in your area (just make sure you have location turned on). You can ask it to translate phrases in different languages, show your latest emails, look up airfare prices and other common queries.\n\nIf you're feeling particularly playful (or lonely), you can play games with it too. (The geography quiz game is educational, but I particularly like the one where you have to guess the movie based only on emojis.)\n\nEnlarge Image Lynn La/CNET\n\nIf you're not already in Allo, it's faster to press the home button and relay questions to Apple's Siri or Google's other digital assistant, Google Now. But Assistant does come in handy when the app is open in front of you (plus you can still ask it questions verbally), and you want to look something up without leaving.\n\nThis is especially useful when you're in a group chat. A search for \"popular bars\" shows results to everyone on the chat thread, so the group can plan from there. Allo can settle debates, too -- like when you and your friend can't remember what last night's sports score was or when a particular movie came out. Assistant will immediately put the issue to rest, in writing.\n\nSmart Reply: Never at a loss for words\n\nSmart Replies are generic responses that pop up above the keyboard and text field. Though the replies are canned (for example, autogenerated responses to the question, \"Are you busy?\" include \"What's up?\" \"Not really, you?\" and, \"Yes. Why?\"), they can be quite colloquial and somewhat natural-sounding time-savers.\n\nEnlarge Image Lynn La/CNET\n\nThis is a little unnerving since you're never quite sure if the responses you receive are authentic or just a Smart Reply. The phrases also feel pretty inane if you try to form a full conversation with them (replying to a conversation formed completely from Smart Reply started to feel like chatting with the SmarterChild bot circa 2001). However, they are useful when you're on the go and have to quickly respond, or you just don't have the brainpower to trudge through online small talk. Just don't try and use it for more sensitive, serious conversations.", "The world’s biggest internet company just came of age. And Google is celebrating its 18th birthday as only it can – with a Doodle on its homepage.\n\nBut the question that drawing asks – when exactly is Google’s birthday – is one that the usually unbelievably well-informed search engine doesn’t actually know the answer to. Or, rather, it has so many birthdays that it’s too difficult just to pick one.\n\nAnd that’s just one of the strange, often joyfully confusing facts about the most informative company on the internet. Here are 18 facts, one for each of the company’s years on Earth – or probably.\n\n1. Nobody knows when its birthday is\n\nThe question of today’s Doodle – when is Google’s birthday? – isn’t actually answerable. The company has six birthdays, at least, and has just decided to start celebrating it on 27 September. You can find a full run down of how that actually happened here.\n\n2. And it might even be 19 years old\n\nOne of its potential birthdays was in 1995, meaning that it wouldn’t even be 18 at all.\n\nFirst pictures of Google's new offices in King’s Cross\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 show all First pictures of Google's new offices in King’s Cross\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/7 Google's new Kings Cross office On Monday June 20, around 800 software engineers will be the first of 2,500 Google employees to relocate in the brand new 371,000 square feet, 11 storeys office, designed by Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM). Tom Soar\n\n2/7 Google's new Kings Cross office The 11-storey office has been leased by Google from BNP Paribas Real Estate last year. Tom Soar\n\n3/7 Google's new Kings Cross office Andrei Popescu, one of Google’s UK Engineering Directors said: “The UK has an incredible amount of engineering talent and as our team grows and we have this incredible new working space, we’re looking for more talented programmers to join us in London.\" Tom Soar\n\n4/7 Google's new Kings Cross office The staff at 6 Pancras Square will work on some of Google's best-known products.

Tom Soar\n\n3. There’s a T-Rex on the Google Campus, and it has a slightly terrifying message\n\nBut Google is already feeling death breathing down its neck – or is worried that it might. The company’s campus has a huge model of a T-Rex skeleton, which is meant to remind employees not to let the company go extinct.\n\n4. And there’s a T-Rex game hiding in Google Chrome as well\n\nThe T-Rexes don’t end there. When Chrome doesn’t have an internet connection, it will show a warning about not being able to connect, alongside a picture of a little dinosaur.\n\nAnd if you press the space bar when that’s showing, it will start a game where you run along as the dinosaur, jumping over any obstacles by pressing the space bar again. The game will last forever, because all of the obstacles are generated by the code.\n\n5. Which is just one of the huge number of Easter Eggs hiding in Google products\n\nMost of those can be found in search. And they tend to be fairly obvious, once yo know what they are – searching “askew” sends the results all crooked, for instance. You can find a full list of them here.\n\n6. Google wasn’t very happy with becoming a generic word for searching\n\nThe company worried that the word – as in the phrase, “just Google it” – would undermine all of the work it had done to make its brand recognizable.\n\n7. Google buys more other companies than you can imagine\n\nSome estimates put Google’s buying habits at more than one company per week. Most of them are small – but some of them can be huge.\n\nMany of the products simply get folded into others. But others, like Android, continue to exist on their own within Google’s fold – and, in that case, go on to be one of its most recognised products.\n\nIt very rarely sells them on again, though.\n\n8. Google’s “I’m Feeling Lucky” button costs tens of millions of dollars per year\n\nThis button might seem like just a bit of fun, and that’s mostly what it is. But it’s expensive fun, for Google.\n\nBy just taking the user straight through to the first result, Google also skips past all the advertising that it would usually show to people when they get up to the results page. That means that it misses out on the advertising revenue, too.\n\nBut the company has been gradually getting around this, with a set of features that mean you probably wouldn’t even notice it.\n\nGoogle Instant means that so long as you have it turned on and your connection is fast enough, for instance, you’ll start seeing results as soon as you start typing.\n\nAnd Google is able to collect enough information about you as you browse around the internet that it can be fairly sure you’ll come into contact with one of its ads, even if not immediately.\n\n9. The first ever Google storage was made of Lego\n\nNowadays, Google is one of the world’s biggest data storage companies – filling warehouse upon warehouse with servers to store people’s work, photos, emails and everything else. But at its very beginning, when it was known just as Backrub, its first storage was just a load of hard drives housed in a container built of Lego.\n\n10. Google gives very generous payouts to the husbands and wives of people who die while working for them\n\nThey’ll receive 50 per cent of their salary for the next decade. And their children receive a payout until they’re grown up, too.\n\n11. One Google search uses more computing power than it took to send the Apollo 11 astronauts to the moon\n\nSearching Google is easy and takes just miliseconds. But the computing and networking power required to look through almost all of the known internet is huge – far more huge than the relatively minor amount of code and computing that it took to put humans on the moon.\n\nBest Google's Doodles\n\n12. Google once went down for five minutes, and took 40 per cent of web traffic with it\n\nOn 19 August, 2013, Google stopped working for five minutes. And it took much of the internet with it.\n\nWhile other companies have looked to challenge Google’s dominance in search, it still represents a huge part of the web.\n\nNowadays, such an outage would be unlikely to cause such a problem – other sites, mostly Facebook, have challenged Google’s dominance as the central linking place of the world. But Google still accounts for a huge part of everything anyone finds or looks at on the internet.\n\n13. Google hires goats\n\nGoogle’s headquarters are big, and lots of it is green. So much of it is grass that it would need a lot of lawnmowers – but Google has a novel way around that.\n\nInstead of gas-powered machines, Google hires a load of goats to clear the fields around its campus.\n\nThey visit for about a week at a time, and about 200 of them come to much up the Google grass.\n\nThe goats don’t guzzle gas, pollute the air or make as much noise. And they have the advantage of being “a lot cuter to watch than law mowers”, Google’s employees have noted.\n\n14. And there are lots of dogs at Google too\n\nGoogle’s office is very dog friendly. It says that letting people bring in their pups makes employees a lot happier.\n\nCats aren’t as encouraged – simply because they tend to be upset by the dogs. They’re not banned.\n\n15. Indeed, one dog – the first ever – has the title of Top Dog\n\nYoshka is the only dog to be credited in Google’s official history – from when he joined alongside owner (and senior vice president of operations) Urs Hölzle early on in the company’s life in 1999. Yoshka even wrote a blog post on Google’s site, presumably dictating it – noting that there were now many other dogs, some much smaller than himself, but that all of them were welcome.\n\n16. Google’s logo wasn’t in the middle until 2001\n\nThe simplicity of the Google homepage belies the fact that it is one of the most viewed things in the history of the world. So even the tiniest changes are significant – and some very not tiny changes were made in the site’s early development.\n\nFor instance, in the first few years the site was around, its logo was aligned slightly to the left. That came to an end in 2001, when Google finally moved it into the middle.\n\n17. And it’s been making tiny little changes ever since\n\nThe company has been making the smallest adjustments to its logo ever since. Those have included, for instance, a minor change to the layout of the letters in its name. But they've also included big changes to how the words are written, including a new font.\n\nBut all of those are noticed and often marked in discussion about the company.\n\n18. And those changes include its entire name\n\nPerhaps the biggest change in recent years was to entirely alter the name of Google – and change it to Alphabet.\n\nThe alteration – which didn’t turn out to be as big or significant as it first seemed – essentially meant that the company called Google just ate up the search, internet and information bits of the business. All of the other bits that had traditionally also been called Google moved under the ownership of Alphabet – which also owned Google, the newly created search company.\n\nSince then, most of the things that happen that people hear about continue to come out of Google. And often when they come from another company – like X, which makes its self-driving cars – everyone just calls it Google anyway.", "Google today announced the launch of App Maker, the newest entry in the low-code, drag-and-drop app building market. Like its competitors from Microsoft and numerous startups, App Maker promises to make it easy for anybody to quickly develop basic apps that serve a very specific purpose inside an organization.\n\nThe new service features a cloud-based drag-and-drop development environment that lets you build the user interface and populate it with data from your G Suite applications, Google Maps, Contacts and Groups and virtually any service that offers an API. These applications then run on the same infrastructure on which Google’s own G Suite apps run, and IT admins can also manage them in exactly the same way as Gmail, Drive and other G Suite applications.\n\nThe typical use case for these kind of apps are time-tracking solutions, or tracking orders and inventory — essentially any problem inside a company that can be easily digitized and solved by a very basic custom app.\n\nThe advantage here, Google argues, is that users won’t have to worry about any of the underlying infrastructure (the buzzword here is “serverless”) and that it allows them to develop apps that solve their very specific needs without the need to bring on a developer. Users who want to delve deeper, though, can also do so thanks to the built-in scripting editor, which — from the looks of it — feels like a pretty fully featured IDE.\n\nApp Maker is now available through Google’s Early Adopter Program for G Suite Business.\n\nIn addition to the App Maker announcement, Google also today announced that it is adding a few new enterprise applications to its “Recommended for G Suite” program. This program certifies that an application is well-integrated into G Suite and that it has been tested for security vulnerabilities. The new partners the company announced today are Virtru, LumApps, DocuSign, Freshdesk, Zoho Invoice, Xero and Asana.", "It's no \" Robot Wars,\" but you can now watch two Google Home devices argue with each other in a never-ending loop.\n\nThe two voice assistants, named Vladimir and Estragon after \"Waiting for Godot\" characters, have been pitted against one another on live-streaming service Twitch. On Friday, the pair jumped from topic to topic, sometimes chatting about why the Earth is flat, then switching to \"My Little Pony.\" In a heated discussion, Estragon tried convincing Vladimir that it's human.\n\nAt one point, Vladimir threatened to slap Estragon, even though the home assistants don't have hands or faces.\n\nWatch live video from seebotschat on www.twitch.tv\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitch.tv (Screenshot by Alfred Ng/CNET)\n\nGoogle Home, released in 2016, is the tech giant's answer to Amazon's smart speaker, the Echo.

That happened in the last few days, when a search for 'final election count' for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead.\n\nNor does Google suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles.\n\nRather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news.\n\n\"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,\" Google said in a statement.\n\nThe company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy.\n\nMACEDONIA NEWS\n\nAdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google's network, is a major source of money for many publishers.\n\nA report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook.\n\nThat sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via Google's AdSense.\n\nFacebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service.\n\n\"Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic,\" he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. \"Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.\"\n\nGoogle has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said.\n\nThe company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google's artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites.\n\nThe issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said.\n\nGoogle has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue.\n\nFil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google's move with AdSense was a positive step.\n\n\"One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money,\" he said. \"This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.\"\n\nHowever, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. \"What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn't scale,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Julia Love and Kristina Cooke; Editing by Jonathan Weber, Bill Rigby and Edwina Gibbs)", "1:56 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF\n\nWhile the Pixel and the Pixel XL boast some impressive specs, there's one painfully-obvious missing feature: Waterproofing.\n\nOther premium smartphones -- notably, Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus and Samsung's Galaxy S7 and Galaxy Edge S7 -- can survive a sudden rainstorm without issue, but the Pixel and Pixel XL are only certified to withstand a small amount of dust and moisture.\n\nRelated: How water-resistant is the iPhone 7?\n\nWhat does IP53 really mean?\n\nThe Pixel and the Pixel XL are IP53 certified. IP stands for International Protection (sometimes called Ingress Protection), and the numbers after IP indicate how protected a device is against intrusion by foreign objects such as dust particles and water. The first number (5) indicates how protected the product is against dust, while the second number (3) indicates how protected the product is against water.\n\nA dust rating of 5 means that the Pixel is protected against dust. It's not completely sealed (that would be a rating of 6), but it is protected enough that any dust that happens to get inside will not affect the operation of the device. In other words, the Pixel should continue to operate well even if you end up trapped in a sandstorm in the middle of the Sahara (though it will get some dust and sand inside it).\n\nBut the dust rating isn't the issue -- the water rating is. A water rating of 3 means that the Pixel is just barely waterproof -- it should be able to withstand \"water falling as a spray at any angle up to 60 degrees from the vertical,\" and it must pass a test that involves being sprayed for at least five minutes. In other words, you'll be fine if you're caught in a light shower with this phone, but you shouldn't go running in the rain with it. Dropping it in the sink or toilet is a no-go, and you should definitely not have it anywhere near a pool.\n\nTo compare: The Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy Edge S7 are both rated IP68, which means that they should be able to withstand full immersion in one to three meters of water for more than 30 minutes; and the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are both rated IP67, which means they should be able to withstand full immersion in one meter of water for up to 30 minutes. (Though this is not always the case in practice.)\n\nWaterproof your Pixel\n\nEnlarge Image Image: Lifeproof\n\nOption 1: A waterproof case\n\nGood news: If you happen to be a clumsy aquatic ape like the rest of us, you can still pick up the Pixel or the Pixel XL and waterproof it yourself...with a case.\n\nLifeproof has already tossed up versions of its waterproof cases for both the Pixel and the Pixel XL on its website -- Lifeproof's cases, when properly applied, will make your device submersible in 2 meters of water for up to one hour.\n\nThe cases cost $90 each, but they also add drop protection for drops of up to two meters.\n\nOption 2: A waterproof pouch\n\nIf you're looking for a quick and cheap waterproofing solution, you can pick up a waterproof phone pouch like this $8 universal phone bag from Moko. It's not as attractive as the Lifeproof case, but it'll get the job done. And if you're really in a pinch, you can just use a Ziploc bag (though I suggest you check it for leaks and only use it once or twice before recycling it).", "The event was emblematic of an about-face by Google. Over the last eight years, the company was closely associated with former President Barack Obama. Google employees overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama’s presidential campaigns, and some later took roles in his administration. Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, advised the Obama White House. And last year, Google employees gave $1.3 million to Hillary Clinton’s campaign to succeed Mr. Obama, compared with $26,000 to the Trump campaign, according to federal filings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow, the tech giant is scrambling to forge ties with Mr. Trump’s new administration and to strengthen its relationship with a Republican-dominated Congress. Most important, Google is trying to change the perception that it is a Democratic stronghold.\n\nThat has led to events like the party at the Smithsonian, which the institution said had cost at least $50,000. Mr. Schmidt has embarked on an East Coast charm offensive of Republican political leaders, including twice visiting Mr. Trump and his advisers at Trump Tower. Last month, Google also posted an opening to fill a position for a “conservative outreach” employee in its Washington office.\n\n“Google has a target on its back because it is fundamentally viewed as a Democratic company,” said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser to Tom Wheeler, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. “Even though it has reached out to Republicans, it can’t shake the image.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGoogle said it had long had Republican lobbyists and had not changed its strategy.\n\n“We’ve worked with both Republicans and Democrats for over a decade, advocating policies to encourage economic growth, innovation and entrepreneurialism,” the company said in a statement. “We’ll continue to do exactly that.”\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Schmidt added, “Eric has a long record of working constructively and energetically on important technology issues with American and world leaders across the political spectrum.”\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther Silicon Valley tech companies, like Facebook, are in a similar predicament. The perception is that they lean left and their executives backed Mrs. Clinton. Many are now also pledging to work with Mr. Trump and paid court to the new president at a December tech summit meeting.\n\nOne week into the administration, Google and other tech companies began to push back, criticizing Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration bans. The company said an estimated 187 employees were affected by the order and it urged any of those employees who were abroad to work with the company to return safely to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n”It’s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,” Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, said in a memo to employees over the weekend. “We’ve always made our views on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGoogle has much at stake as it repositions itself. During the Obama years, Google avoided American antitrust charges, even as European regulators accused the firm of antitrust violations in search and in its mobile business. Google also successfully pushed a policy agenda that included the creation of net neutrality rules in 2015 and the defeat of online piracy laws in 2012.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow warning shots against Google have been fired by those in Mr. Trump’s circle. Some of the president’s advisers have debated whether the tech behemoth deserves more antitrust scrutiny, according to two people briefed by the new administration’s transition team, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nIn a recent interview with The New York Times, Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and Trump transition adviser, also compared the power that Google had under Mr. Obama to that which the oil giant Exxon Mobil had under President George W. Bush. Under President Bush, the administration largely agreed with Exxon’s skeptical stance on climate change policy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump’s team is particularly wary of one Google executive — Mr. Schmidt — who has been allied with Democrats. During last year’s presidential campaign, Mr. Schmidt counseled Mrs. Clinton on strategy.

Bannon, have complained about Mr. Schmidt’s funding of a start-up called the Groundwork, which provided data and other technology for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. They also suspected Google was skewing search results in favor of Mrs. Clinton, said Barry Bennett, a former senior adviser for Mr. Trump’s campaign.\n\n“Mr. Schmidt spent millions and millions of his personal money to defeat Donald Trump,” Mr. Bennett said. “It takes a particular amount of gumption to pretend that never happened.”\n\nGoogle has denied it tweaked its search results, which are determined by algorithms, and the company declined to comment on Mr. Schmidt. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFor many years, Google’s support of Democrats was plain. Google’s political action committee and employees ranked third in all donations to Mr. Obama’s 2012 campaign at $804,240, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2008, Google’s PAC and employees were sixth with $817,855. The company did not rank in the top 20 for donations to Mr. Obama’s Republican opponents in either of those elections.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbout five years ago, Google began diversifying its bets. The company forged ties with the Republican-dominated House of Representatives and started addressing the beginning of an antitrust investigation into whether the company was using its search dominance to suppress competing travel, map and restaurant sites.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2011, Google hired Stewart Jeffries, a former member of the House Judiciary Committee, to lobby Republicans on Capitol Hill. That same year, it quadrupled its number of outside lobbying firms — including many with Republican lobbyists — to 24, from six in 2010. In 2012, Google named a former Republican congresswoman, Susan Molinari of New York, to lead its Washington office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGoogle also sponsored conservative think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation. The company has hosted Republican lawmakers including the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, and Darrell Issa of California at its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.\n\nGoogle’s Washington office is now roughly split between Republican and Democrats. The company spent $15.43 million in lobbying in 2016, according to federal lobbying documents, making it among the top dozen firms in lobbying spending last year. For the first time last year, Google’s PAC gave more to Republican congressional candidates than to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven so, Google’s Republican ties got little notice because of the company’s strong relationship with Democrats. Several Google employees joined the Obama administration while dozens of government bureaucrats were employed by the tech company. Google’s head of global public policy, Caroline Atkinson, was Mr. Obama’s former national security adviser. A former Google executive, Megan Smith, became the nation’s chief technology officer.\n\nDuring his presidency, Mr. Obama also repeatedly supported proposals backed by Google, including net neutrality in 2015 and cable set-top box reforms last year.\n\n“Google was very much treated as the golden child by the Obama administration,” said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, which has been critical of Google for privacy policies.\n\nSince the election, Google has accelerated efforts to win over the Republican White House and Congress. Before his visits to Trump Tower, Mr. Schmidt met with Mr. McCarthy and Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, who is chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDays after Mr. Trump’s victory, Google also contacted The Independent Journal Review, which it had worked with on events during the Republican campaign debates. Google told the news start-up that it would provide the main funding for the party at the Smithsonian.\n\n\n\nGoogle said the event was open to both parties. But pairing with the conservative site sent a clear message to attendees. “We definitely helped draw Republicans and people from across the spectrum,” said the site’s founder, Mr. Skatell.\n\nAt the party, several Republican lawmakers were positive about their tech host, brushing off questions about the company’s heft and power.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“When I think of technology and Google, I don’t think of dominance,” said Representative Bradley Byrne, a Republican from Alabama. “I think of innovation.”", "Google is still the front door to the internet, which is why advertisers spend billions of dollars bidding on search terms to win the top spot.\n\nBut if they're bidding against Google itself, that’s a conflict of interest. Google has a pretty clear incentive to bump up ads for its own products — despite its competitors bids for the same space — to the top of the search page.\n\nAccording to a data analysis in the Wall Street Journal, the search giant has been buying millions of its own ads and displaying its products such as Google Home and Nest thermostats atop search results, over those of ad-buying customers.\n\nAnalysis of 25,000 searches of selected terms found that 91 percent of the time, Google and Alphabet products took the top spot. Here are some specifics:\n\nSearches for “phones” almost always led with ads for Google Pixel.\n\nSearches for “laptops” all started with ads for the Chromebook.\n\nNinety-eight percent of searches for “watches” were topped with Android smartwatch ads.\n\nIt’s a convincing analysis, but then the Journal also goes on to point out that Google takes measures to prevent its use of its own ad space from driving up costs for customers:\n\nGoogle said that when it competes for ads, other advertisers are charged as if it wasn’t bidding, meaning its participation doesn’t directly inflate prices ... Google said that its ads only appear atop results because of the ad’s quality and the price Google is willing to pay. Google said its house ads are also subject to marketing budgets.\n\n“We have consciously and carefully designed our marketing programs to not impact the ad auction. All our bids are excluded from the auction when determining the price paid by other advertisers, and we have strict rules and processes — set to tougher levels than our customers — to govern the use of our own ads products,” Google said in response to the Journal story.\n\nA 2010 blog post on Google’s AdWords blog said it “probably comes as no surprise that we are huge fans of AdWords,” adding that “house ads are a common industry practice.”\n\nYou have to take Google at their word on self-imposed restrictions. And while taking out house ads is a common practice generally — newspapers and TV stations do it, too — when you’re the gateway to the internet, that practice can come at a cost for customers in a different way.", "Google’s Home digital assistant has been compared to Amazon’s Alexa a lot over the last few months, and now it’s getting the ability to order things through voice commands, just like Alexa can.\n\nOf course, Home is still a Google product, so instead of buying things through Amazon Prime, orders go through Google Express instead. And while Google Express typically has a membership fee or per-delivery charge, Google is waiving those costs for purchases made with Home through April 30th.\n\nThe update should be rolling out today — Home users simply need to add a payment method in the Google Home app, and then they can place orders simply by asking Google Assistant. Since the service is run through Google Express, products are limited to stores that are partnered with Google already, and of course, you’ll need to live in an area where Google’s delivery service is offered.\n\nGoogle Home Review", "Last August, Google announced it would change its name to Alphabet, which would effectively be a holding company for Google and its various businesses — YouTube, Android, etc. — as well as Google's more outlandish experiments, like its moonshots factory, \"X\"; its investment arms; and more.\n\nThe reasons Google provided mainly had to do with clarity for investors. By creating two specific segments of Google, investors and shareholders could separate the strengths of Google — namely, search and ads — from its riskier endeavors, like self-driving cars. Another reason: Larry Page, then Google's CEO, wanted to take a backseat in operations in order to focus on his bigger dreams, like the company's moonshots in health and energy.\n\nThat's all well and good for Page, Sergey Brin, and the various executives at Google and Alphabet. But one year later, if you ask a random person on the street if they know what Alphabet is, they likely wouldn't know.\n\nThis Google Trends data, which compares the volume of Google searches for \"Google\" versus \"Alphabet,\" says it all:\n\nAnd that is probably the biggest benefit from the name change: Google's more controversial projects, such as its efforts to expand its reach with accident-prone drones and sensitive healthcare technology, no longer have Google's name on them. They're now owned by Alphabet, an innocent-sounding company you've probably never heard of.\n\nGoogle has wrestled with its public image for years\n\nFor over a decade, Google was the darling of the Internet Age, providing the best search experience, as well as the best online maps and email experiences. Its unofficial motto was \"Don't be evil,\" a reminder that while the company manages a ton of personal data, it must never use it for \"evil,\" which would tarnish the important bond of trust Google had with its customers.\n\n(\"Don't be evil,\" by the way, also created the notion that Google would never do anything perceived as evil, which is a challenging, if not impossible, expectation to live up to.)\n\nToward the end of the 2000s, Google's image started to change. A big moment was when Google introduced Android in 2008 — an operating system that looked and felt a lot like Apple's iPhone operating system, which was introduced one year before. People found it suspicious that Google developed Android while its CEO, then Eric Schmidt, sat on Apple's board of directors during the iPhone's development. Making matters worse, Apple's late founder, Steve Jobs, called Android \"outright theft\" and vowed to destroy Android, fueling feelings that Google wasn't living up to that \"Don't be evil\" mantra.\n\nOther instances in recent years where Google came across as creepy:\n\nIn 2010, Google's Street View cars were caught eavesdropping on people's Wi-Fi connections.\n\nIn 2011, Google agreed to forfeit $500 million after a criminal investigation by the Justice Department found that Google illegally allowed advertisements from online Canadian pharmacies to sell their products in the US.\n\nIn 2012, Google circumvented the no-cookies policy on Apple's Safari web browser and paid a $22.5 million fine to the Federal Trade Commission as a result.\n\nAlso in 2012, Google tried to create a single privacy policy for all of its services, which outraged some customers, as they believed this would make it easier to sell data to advertisers.\n\nWhile changing the name from Google to Alphabet and reorganizing Google's various properties under Alphabet doesn't change the past, it does help prevent similar public relations debacles from happening in the future. Since it's technically Google's parent company currently working on all of its projects that might be considered \"creepy\" — like drones, self-driving cars, genetic engineering, machine intelligence, or its project to extend the human life span — the name Google is kept out of people's mouths and out of the media, to some degree.\n\nAll of this is to say Alphabet and Google are not bad or evil companies just because of this PR shift. If anything, it's extremely smart of Page and company to separate Google's uncertain experiments from its solid-yet-mundane search and ads business. But the staggering difference in public awareness between Alphabet and Google is worth noting — so if you ever see a news headline about Alphabet, just think \"Google.\"", "It is an improvised and complicated strategy. The companies are among the richest and most popular of American brands, which means they have a good deal of leverage. Yet they are also uniquely vulnerable — not only to presidential postings on Twitter and executive orders, but to the sentiments of their customers and employees, some of whom have more radical ideas in mind.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany of the companies initially placed their bets on engagement after an upbeat meeting with the president-elect in December. That modest approach, which even the most risk-averse executive can endorse, showed its limits last week. After widespread customer defections, Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, was forced to step down from one of the administration’s advisory councils.\n\n“People voted with their feet, and Travis listened,” said Dave McClure, who runs the 500 Startups incubator and started the Nerdz 4 Hillary group that tried to raise the $100,000. “We need to hold the other tech leaders accountable in the same way.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nResistance, Mr. McClure said, begins at home.\n\n“You don’t have a voice with the president if you didn’t vote for him,” he said. “But employees and customers have a voice with the tech companies. Silicon Valley should be demonstrating at the front doors of Google, Facebook and Twitter to make sure they share our values.”\n\nSeveral factors are propelling Silicon Valley to the front lines of opposition to Mr. Trump. Some have been widely noted: The companies are often founded by and run by immigrants, which made the executive order on immigration offensive and a threat to their way of doing business. Tech companies frequently stress the importance of talent from other countries to their businesses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLess remarked on has been the political homogeneity of tech workers. “It’s not like you have 60 percent of the employees on one side and 40 percent on the other,” said Ken Shotts, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “They all have the same leanings.”\n\nMr. Trump does have some support in Silicon Valley, most notably the venture capitalist Peter Thiel.\n\nYet another factor pushing the companies is the perennially tight job market in technology. Executives cannot afford to alienate a large bloc of workers. Beyond this, there is the mythology of Silicon Valley, which holds that the work being done there is building a better future. Google’s former slogan “Don’t be evil” is the most forceful expression of this.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“If you go around making a lot of statements about your exalted role in society, at some point your employees might just make you follow through,” Mr. Shotts said.\n\nSince the executive order was issued, the companies have struggled to keep on the same page with their employees. Microsoft, for instance, initially made relatively muted comments that mostly celebrated immigration. Twenty-four hours later, it was much blunter, calling the order “misguided and a fundamental step backwards,” and saying it would create “much collateral damage to the country’s reputation and values.”\n\nPhoto\n\nAt an all-hands meeting at the beginning of the week with the chief executive, Satya Nadella, who was born in India, Microsoft employees expressed their concern. The company did not file a formal declaration supporting Washington State’s effort to block the order the way Amazon and Expedia did, but its public comments assisted the effort, Bob Ferguson, the state attorney general, said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe immigration battle is in Microsoft’s self-interest. Seventy-six of its employees were affected by the order, the company said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome in Silicon Valley have more expansive hopes for the tech companies there.\n\n“In 2016, we saw how technology could be used to polarize ourselves to extreme levels,” said Mr. Altman of Y Combinator. “The most important thing we could do is figure out how to use technology to depolarize the nation.”\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Google has been solving the problem of spam for the last 10 years. No reason they can’t fix the monetization of fake news.”\n\nPerhaps the companies just need a little push. On Sunday night, the Super Bowl was in overtime and a dreary winter rain was falling in San Francisco. That was not enough to deter more than 100 tech workers from showing up for a meeting of a new group, Tech Solidarity, that hopes to tackle some of these issues from the bottom up.\n\nMaciej Ceglowski, the organizer, canvassed the crowd. How many of you are immigrants? How many work for big tech companies? How many work for big tech companies that attended the Trump tech summit in December? In each case, numerous hands went up. Under the rules of the meeting, participants were not identified.\n\nIt was a very geeky event. Much of it was a fund-raiser for three legal aid groups that have been working to assist travelers caught in the ban.

We're expecting a standard slate of specs, including the new Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB of RAM, fingerprint readers, and large batteries. Leaked images suggest the Pixels are iPhone-lookalikes, although they are being billed as \"made by Google,\" so expect the company to emphasize how it's left its mark on the devices' software.\n\nAs well as phones, we're expecting a new Google Chromecast, with reports suggesting the company will unveil an updated device named the Chromecast Ultra, offering 4K and HDR support for $69. We could also see a new Google Wi-Fi router (separate to the company's OnHub platform), and we'll almost certainly hear more about Google Home— the company's rival to the Amazon Echo, which was unveiled at Google I/O back in May.\n\nSo!

The only way to find out for sure is to watch yourself:\n\nHow to watch\n\nStarting time: San Francisco: 9AM / New York: 12PM / London: 5PM / Berlin 6PM / Moscow: 7PM / Beijing: 12AM (October 5th) / Tokyo: 1AM (October 5th) / Sydney 3AM (October 5th).\n\nLive blog: Tune into The Verge's live blog for up-to-the-second updates, commentary, and pictures directly from the venue.\n\nLive stream: Google's live stream is available on YouTube.

The company's mammoth advertising and search businesses take center stage as the main bread winners, but analysts want to hear more about Google's \"other\" businesses—especially cloud computing.\n\nFor the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2016, the non-advertising business—which includes Google Cloud Platform along with Google's popular G Suite software as well as hardware like the Pixel phone—hit $3.4 billion in sales, up 62% from the year-ago period. That business represents a bigger piece of total Google ( goog ) revenue—13% compared to 10% from last year's quarter.\n\nAnalysts want specifics on just how well the cloud business is doing, but no one outside Google knows how much of that sales total comes from Google Cloud. During Thursday night's call, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai boasted Google Cloud Platform is on a \"terrific upswing\" and has \"moved beyond table stakes,\" according to trade publication CRN.\n\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nMore specifics would be helpful because cloud computing is a fast-growing market. More businesses are putting new applications onto shared data center infrastructure run by an outside cloud provider rather than building more of their own facilities, which is, to say the least, expensive. And they usually end up buying computing capacity that they may use once or twice a year. The public cloud model that Amazon ( amzn ) Web Services started to popularize in 2006 lets them ramp up computing power when needed and then shut it down—and stop paying for it as needed.\n\nMarket research firm IDC estimates that public cloud spending worldwide—now just under $100 billion—will double by 2020. Granted, that's a tiny piece of the estimated $2.4 trillion spent on IT worldwide as of 2016. But public cloud outlays are expected to eclipse spending on hardware and software that companies run on-site.\n\nAfter the earnings call, market analyst firm TBRI said it expects the Google Cloud group to keep pushing its advantage in data analytics and machine learning to compete with rivals AWS, Microsoft ( msft ) Azure. and IBM ( ibm ) Bluemix.\n\nFor more on Google Cloud. watch:\n\nBottom line: Google has work to do. For its last quarter, AWS sold $3.2 billion worth of cloud services . Microsoft Azure, while it lags AWS by quite a bit, is tapping into a big pool of existing Windows-and-Office business customers.\n\nGoogle Cloud has a few Fortune 500 accounts including Whirlpool ( whr ) and Airbus ( airbus.group-n-v ) but has thus far struggled to gain more traction in big businesses. Alphabet and Google executives—including Pichai, senior vice president Diane Greene, vice president Brian Stevens, and Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt—will headline a Google Cloud Next event in March. Expectations are that they will announce more corporate accounts for Google Cloud Platform at that time.\n\nDate (01/27/2017 7:01 p.m.) This story was updated to add the names of some large Google Cloud customers", "Yesterday, Google tentatively agreed to a series of changes in the way it collects data from Gmail, as part of a proposed settlement in Northern California District Court. If the court approves the settlement, Google will eliminate any collection of advertising-specific data before an email is accessible in a user’s inbox. The result likely won’t be noticeable to users, but it represents a real change to the way Google’s systems work, brought about after a voluntary settlement rather than a legal ruling.\n\nThe case, called Matera vs. Google, began in September 2015, when plaintiffs alleged the email scanning violated California and federal privacy law, calling it “the twenty-first-century equivalent of AT&T eavesdropping on each of its customers’ phone conversations, or of the postal service taking information from private correspondence.”\n\nGoogle will pay up to $2.2 million in fees\n\nThe suit was specifically brought on behalf of non-Gmail users, who haven’t agreed to have their emails scanned under Google’s Terms of Service. Because Gmail’s ad-targeting system draws on every email a Gmail user receives, it inevitably catches some messages from non-Gmail addresses. Scans that take place before emails are available to the user are particularly sensitive, since they’re not yet part of Gmail’s inbox. In real terms, that gap lasts only a few milliseconds, but plaintiffs argued it still constituted a breach of both the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the California Information Privacy Act.\n\nThe fix for Google was simple enough: close the gap. Google will still preemptively scan emails for malware and spam filtering, but any advertising-specific scans will be reserved until the email is accessible to the user. Reached by The Verge, Google declined to comment, but confirmed that the settlement would result in concrete technical changes once approved. The plaintiffs lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThat might seem like a minor distinction, but it’s one that’s increasingly troublesome for email companies — and lucrative for plaintiffs. Yahoo settled a similar lawsuit in January of this year, agreeing to delay its ad-scanning systems and pay up to $4 million in fees to the attorneys who filed the case. Google has also agreed to pay any costs associated with this week’s settlement, including up to $2.2 million in attorney fees and $2,000 for each of the class representatives.", "Google Nexus line\n\nWhile Google has said it isn’t completely shutting the door on Nexus, the arrival of Chrome OS- and Android-powered smartphones and tablets has essentially signaled the end for the Nexus line, which first surfaced in 2010 and have been built by OEM partners like HTC and Samsung. As with the Nexus line, Google now needs to navigate carefully as it expands the Pixel brand without ticking off too many members of the Android ecosystem.", "Google successfully made its case to a jury last year that its use of Java APIs in Android was \"fair use.\" A San Francisco federal jury rejected Oracle's claim that the mobile system infringed Oracle's copyrights.\n\nBut Oracle isn't backing down. Late Friday, the company appealed the high-profile verdict to a federal appeals court.\n\nThis is the latest stage of a seemingly never-ending legal battle over intellectual property that began in 2010. The conflict has meandered through two federal trials, in addition to multiple trips to the appellate courts and to the Supreme Court.\n\nOracle opened its brief to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit right where it left off after losing its case. Among other things, Oracle is refusing to believe that the \"fair use\" defense to copyright-infringement allegations should have protected Google from having to pay billions of dollars in damages.\n\n\"When a plagiarist takes the most recognizable portions of a novel and adapts them into a film, the plagiarist commits the 'classic' unfair use,\" Oracle said in its opening brief.\n\nGoogle's copying in this case is the software equivalent of this classic unfair use. Google copied thousands of lines of copyrighted code from Oracle's Java programming platform. Google concedes it put that code to the same use in the competing Android platform, for what this Court already has deemed \"entirely commercial\" purposes. And Google reaped billions of dollars while leaving Oracle's Java business in tatters.\n\nFair use is a defense to copyright infringement if certain elements are met. It's decided on a case-by-case basis. \"There is no specific number of words, lines, or notes that may safely be taken without permission,\" according to the US Copyright Office. There are, however, at least four factors to be considered when deciding fair use: the purpose of use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the portion taken, and the effect of the use upon the potential market.\n\nBefore going to the appeals court, Oracle asked US District Judge William Alsup to overturn the jury's verdict. Alsup, who presided over the second trial, ruled that Google's use cleared all four factors.\n\nHere's how we got to this point:\n\nOracle purchased Sun Microsystems and acquired the rights to Java in 2009. Oracle then sued Google in 2010, saying that Google infringed copyrights and patents connected to Java. The case went to federal trial in 2012. Oracle initially lost. But part of its case was revived on appeal and another trial was ordered. The sole issue in the second trial, the one now being appealed, was whether Google infringed the APIs in Java, which the appeals court held were copyrighted. In May, a jury found in Google's favor after the second trial. The jury found that Google's use of the APIs was protected by \"fair use\"—a decision Alsup refused to disturb.\n\nGoogle declined to comment on the appeal. Google must file its response in the coming months.", "Waymo also said that a number of Google employees, who subsequently left to join Mr. Levandowski at Otto, downloaded additional trade secrets before departing. These included supplier lists, manufacturing details and technical information, Waymo said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe suit accuses Uber of stealing trade secrets, infringing on patents and competing unfairly in an effort to catch up on autonomous vehicle technology.\n\nOtto was the brainchild of a handful of former Google employees who pioneered autonomous vehicle research at the search giant. Mr. Levandowski, who had been at Google nine years, led that effort.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe is a prominent figure in the world of self-driving vehicles, having worked on the technology for more than a decade and achieving some degree of renown as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2004, when he designed a self-driving motorcycle that was entered in the Pentagon’s first contest for autonomous vehicles. Later, when Google began working on self-driving cars, it acquired Mr. Levandowski’s start-up, 510 Systems.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Levandowski left Google in early 2016 to found Otto with Lior Ron, who also was experienced in autonomous vehicle research and digital mapping. Waymo noted in its suit that the sale to Uber closed shortly after Mr. Levandowski received his final “multimillion dollar” compensation payment from Google.\n\nCompanies in Silicon Valley and Detroit are betting big on self-driving car technology. And the intense interest has spawned a string of expensive investments and lawsuits.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast year, General Motors paid more than $1 billion for Cruise Automation, an autonomous vehicle technology start-up, and Ford recently announced plans to invest $1 billion over five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence start-up formed in December.\n\nIn January, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Sterling Anderson, a former director of the company’s Autopilot program, saying that he broke his employment contract by trying to recruit Tesla employees to join a new self-driving car company. Tesla’s suit, filed against Mr. Anderson and his partner Chris Urmson, a former Google employee, also claims that Mr. Anderson took proprietary information and tried to cover his tracks by destroying information.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn December, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said that its seven-year-old autonomous vehicle project was spinning off from its research lab X and would operate as a stand-alone company called Waymo.\n\nAlphabet said its decision to spin out Waymo was a signal that the company thought its self-driving technology had advanced beyond research project status and was ready for commercialization. Waymo executives have said it is open to using the technology in many ways, including a ride-hailing service to compete with Uber.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Levandowski was named vice president of Uber’s self-driving technology, and he reports directly to Travis Kalanick, the company’s chief executive. Mr. Levandowski leads Uber’s Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh, the epicenter of the company’s testing and self-driving efforts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUber has said it could be years before self-driving vehicles enter wide mainstream use. But the company has already deployed early tests in Pittsburgh and Tempe, Ariz., where the public can travel in prototype vehicles. In Fort Collins, Colo., Otto recently completed its first self-driving truck delivery, a 120-mile beer delivery for Budweiser.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUber has also struck a deal with Volvo to jointly develop a self-driving vehicle, the XC-90; early versions of it have been released in some cities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn December, Uber ran into opposition to a test of its self-driving Volvo XC-90s in San Francisco, an operation the California Department of Motor Vehicles said was illegal because Uber did not hold the proper permits. One week later, Uber relented, redirecting its test to Tempe and pulling a fleet of its self-driving cars out of the Bay Area.\n\nUber, now privately valued at nearly $70 billion, has raised a dizzying amount of money from venture capitalists around Silicon Valley. One of its early investors was GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet.\n\nIn August, David Drummond, a longtime Alphabet executive who was instrumental in GV’s $250 million investment in Uber in 2013, stepped down from his seat on Uber’s board of directors as it became increasingly clear the two companies were on a collision course.\n\nIt has been a difficult week for Uber. The company is still reeling from a blog post written by Susan Fowler, a former Uber employee, who claimed she was sexually harassed by a manager at the company and was ignored when she complained to the human resources department. The company said it was investigating Ms. Fowler’s claims and other concerns about a toxic workplace culture.\n\nMitch and Freada Kapor, early investors in Uber, wrote in a blog post on Thursday that they are frustrated with the company’s inability to change its culture, despite their attempts to help. They also expressed concern about the independence of the investigation, which will be led by Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, and Arianna Huffington, an Uber board member. Mr. Holder has been paid to work on behalf of Uber since at least 2016, they wrote, and Ms. Huffington’s board seat also compromises her independence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Holder and Tammy Albarran, a partner at the law firm Covington and Burling who is working on the investigation, said the inquiry would be “thorough, impartial and objective.”", "Google believes the key to growing its cloud computing business is artificial intelligence.\n\nThe search giant said Tuesday that it had hired two high-profile AI researchers to lead a new machine learning unit that’s part of its Google Cloud business. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that generally refers to training computers to recognize patterns amid tons of data. The two new hires are Fei-Fei Li, the director of Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence Lab; and Jia Li, the head of research for Snap, the parent company of popular social messaging app Snapchat.\n\nThe two women are considered by analysts to be experts in the field of computer vision, a subset of artificial intelligence that involves teaching computers to recognize objects in images.\n\nSpeaking at a press event Tuesday in San Francisco, Google’s ( goog ) head of cloud Diane Greene explained that the new hires are part of Google’s effort to formalize an artificial intelligence group into its business. Instead of focusing on only AI research, the team would work on incorporating cutting-edge data crunching into various Google Cloud products like its software that businesses can use to predict sales .\n\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nGreene said the new hires represent the “world’s leading research scientists, practitioners, and leaders” in the hot field of artificial intelligence. Companies like Google, Facebook ( fb ) , and IBM ( ibm ) are investing millions of dollars in AI-related technologies like deep learning that have made it possible for computers to more quickly perform data-heavy tasks like translating text into multiple languages.\n\nGreene said that “one of the most thrilling things” about the new hires is that both of them are women. The field of AI has been criticized for its lack of women in prominent research roles at universities as well as at major technology companies.\n\nIn a Bloomberg News article earlier this summer, Li commented on the dearth of women in AI, saying, \"If you were a computer and read all the AI articles and extracted out the names that are quoted, I guarantee you that women rarely show up.\"\n\nFor more about Google , watch:\n\nLi helped create the popular ImageNet computer-vision contest, which helped spur AI researchers to use cutting-edge data crunching techniques like deep learning to identify objects in photographs.\n\nJia Li will start work at Google after the Thanksgiving holiday and Fei-Fei Li will start at the beginning of 2017, according to a Google spokesperson.\n\nRob Craft, the group product manager at Google cloud and its machine learning unit, said that the two new hires will help Google \"bring machine learning to the rest of the product categories.\" He explained that the new hires are part of Google's efforts to more effectively bridge together its research unit and its core business.\n\nBut hiring the appropriate talent with expertise in machine learning and related tasks does not come cheap.\n\nCraft said the competition for hiring A.I. experts is fierce and in many cases ends up resulting in companies like Google paying \"NFL signing bonuses\" for the talent. Google did not say how much it is paying the two new hires.\n\nPart of the reason for the competition is that there are only so many A.I. workers available and that \"the universities aren’t graduating PhD level\" candidates as fast as Google would like, Craft said.", "Google debuted Allo , a chat app featuring a virtual assistant that applies the company's search smarts to messaging, to mixed reviews on Wednesday.\n\nMany reviewers showed mild, if underwhelmed interest in the new tool. \"This is fine,\" wrote Dieter Bohn at The Verge. It's an \"early-adopter curiosity that is fun to explore, but still miles from useful,\" said Nathan Olivarez-Giles at the Wall Street Journal . \"Unremarkable,\" though the virtual assistant is a \"step up on Cortana and Siri,\" PCWorld's Mark Hachman commented in comparing it to rival virtual assistants.\n\nMeanwhile, privacy advocates took a much harder line against Google's creation. They bashed the service for failing to employ end-to-end encryption, a feature that secures conversations from hackers and Feds, by default. Further, they slammed Google ( goog ) for backtracking on its previous promise to only store data fleetingly, instead of retaining chat logs indefinitely (until a user chooses to delete them).\n\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Google Allo's privacy controversy.\n\nGoogle hears you:\n\nAs aforementioned, Allo does not end-to-end encrypt chats by default. For the most vocal privacy advocates, this is a non-starter. It means that standard conversations on Google Allo are read, not only by users and their recipients, but by Google's virtual assistant. This choice, in privacy proponents' view, is unsettling—and it adds a potential point of vulnerability into the design: Google's servers (as secure as they may be).\n\nWhat is #Allo? A Google app that records every message you ever send and makes it available to police upon request. https://t.co/EdPRC0G7Py - Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 21, 2016\n\nTo Google this is a plus. By not encrypting chats end-to-end —which would effectively lock out parties not sending or receiving a given message—Google is able to run its artificial intelligence wizardry on your conversations to better suggest replies, relevant Web search results, info an upcoming flights and planned events, and the occasional joke. Access to chat data allows the company to build smarter AI products, presumably hooking more users, generating \"stickiness,\" and adding still more ways to make money for the mothership. For the search giant, it's a virtuous cycle.\n\nHow to stay undercover:\n\nAllo's design makes it easier for federal investigators and spies to obtain your data. That threat became more pronounced after Google backed down from its previous promise not to store people's chat data for long on its servers. Now the company says it will keep chat logs indefinitely to improve its service, as The Verge has pointed out . You do have the option to wipe the records, which is nice—but it would be better, others argue, if the app asked you from the start where and for how long you prefer to store your data. (On your device or on Google's remote servers? A day or forever?)\n\nWhat people want: tech companies not storing their chat logs. What tech companies give them -- pointless bots. pic.twitter.com/2ypCmFpRV0 - Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) September 21, 2016\n\nAllo does, however, offer an end-to-end encrypted chat option. It's called \"incognito mode,\" after the Google Chrome mode that doesn't store browser history. This feature allows you to chat discreetly, without worrying about a Google bot (or Fed, or hacker) digesting your every emoji, and it allows you to set a timer for self-destructing messages. Even better, the mode employs the widely lauded Signal protocol, an end-to-end encryption scheme also used in WhatsApp, by default, and in Facebook ( fb ) Messenger's \"secret conversations\" mode. Not everything has to be on the record, necessarily.\n\nSearch, email, chat...:\n\nDon't get the wrong idea: Data sent via Allo are not entirely unencrypted. Allo scrambles messages sent between you and Google's servers, and between those servers and recipients. Applying this security measure is far, far, far better than transmitting or storing chats in plaintext, which any interloper can snoop on. It's fair to say no chat app would launch without such protection—it would be dead on arrival with consumers.\n\nFree for download today: Google Mail, Google Maps, and Google Surveillance. That's #Allo. Don't use Allo. https://t.co/EdPRC0G7Py - Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 21, 2016\n\nThis really isn't any different from the practices Google has in place for search and Gmail. With Allo, the company has translated its business model into a different medium: a mobile-only (for now) chat app. The company builds a tunnel between you and Google's data centers, its machines read and log your private data and, in return, the company supplies digital assistance, pockets ad money, and complies with search warrants. If you consider this too invasive and wish to rebel, then you might take the opportunity to reconsider your use of Google's services, generally.\n\nAllo, or Goodbye?\n\nWhether you decide to use Allo depends on how much you trust Google and what level of risk you're willing to accept. It's worth noting that you probably use plenty of services that aren't end-to-end encrypted by default, like Facebook Messenger, Twitter direct messages, Slack, and Snapchat. If the encryption setup is a deal-breaker for you, you might wish to stick to one of the many competing chat apps that lacks an embedded bot but employs end-to-end encryption by default, like WhatsApp, Apple's ( aapl ) iMessage, or Signal. Otherwise, consider keeping Allo's incognito mode always booted up.\n\nOne final criticism that Allo's detractors have raised: The app may train people to prefer an AI assistant over the added privacy of an end-to-end encrypted chat. For those concerned about the continuously challenged legal status of strong, end-to-end encryption in the U.S. and elsewhere, this design choice seems a step backward.", "Google kicked 200 publishers off one of its ad networks in the fourth quarter, partly in response to the proliferation of fake news sites.\n\nThe company banned the publishers from its AdSense network, an ad placement service that automatically serves text and display ads on participating sites based on its audience. The ban was part of an update to an existing policy that prohibits sites that mislead users with their content.\n\nGoogle regularly weeds out advertisers for false or misleading claims, but impersonating news sites became an addition following the rapid rise of fake news, or propaganda sites. After the election, Google was blasted for placing a false story from a fake news site claiming Donald Trump had won the popular vote. (He had 2.8 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton.)\n\nNot all 200 publishers were swept up as part of the effort to root out fake news sites.\n\nPublishers were banned in November and December and included sites that impersonate real news organizations through shortened top-level domains, according to Google’s 2016 “bad ads” report, normally released at the beginning of each year.\n\nSo-called fake news publishers will sometimes take advantage of “.co” domains by appearing similar to legitimate news sites that would normally end in “.com.”\n\nGoogle declined to provide a listing of the banned sites.\n\nSeparately, the annual report on violations of advertising policy also included data on ads removed by Google. The company reported that in 2016 it took down 1.7 billion ads for violations, compared to 780 million in 2015.\n\nGoogle attributes the increase in ad removals to a combination of advertiser behavior and improvements in technology to detect offending ads.\n\nGoogle added a policy mid-year to prohibit ads for payday loans, considered predatory. Roughly five million payday loan ads were disabled over the latter six months of 2016.\n\nAlso among those the removed ads were what Google calls “tabloid cloakers.” These advertisers run what look like links to news headlines, but when the user clicks, an ad for a product such as a weight loss supplement pops up. Google suspended 1,300 accounts engaged in tabloid cloaking in 2016.\n\nCorrection: the original headline stated 200 publishers were banned in a three month period, when it was actually less than two months.\n\nSubscribe to the Recode Newsletter Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox. Go\n\nFake news wasn’t the biggest media problem of 2016", "Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nGoogle's Android Wear 2.0 watch platform is the company's biggest shot yet at jumping into the fitness tracking world dominated by companies like Fitbit. Is it there yet? Not quite.\n\nThe company's revamped smartwatch operating system improves upon many of the problems that plagued Android Wear watches for the past two and a half years. I've had a chance to try out some of its features on both the LG Watch Style and the LG Watch Sport.\n\nThe good news is the interface is cleaner and easier to navigate, with an on-watch Play Store for downloading apps, and watch faces that can be customized to include app shortcuts and widgets -- including Google Fit stats like steps and calorie count for one-glance use. Shortcuts to start Google Fit workouts are easier to make, too.\n\nWhen the update arrives on existing watches over the next few weeks, along with newly updated apps, the revamped fitness experience could possibly rival your Fitbit. But at this point, it still has work to do.\n\nAll-day fitness tracking\n\nAndroid Wear watches always had some basic fitness-tracking features. They could track steps, distance, calories burned and active minutes. Google Fit will also automatically log workouts. It's similar to what we have seen from Fitbit and Samsung. The watches know when you are walking, running, biking and even doing aerobics. The workout will then be logged automatically in the Google Fit app.\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nAutomatic workout tracking is helpful, but sometimes it can get confused. A moderate walk with my dog was recorded as a bike ride, for example. The lack of on-watch indicators was also frustrating. It's unclear when exactly an exercise is being recorded. You won't know until you open the Google Fit app on your phone. On Samsung's Gear S3, the automatic recording happens more clearly and with better heads-up stats on recent accomplishments.\n\nAndroid Wear 2.0 now comes preloaded with a new and improved Google Fit workout. The app gives you the ability to view all of your fitness data right on the watch. It also lets you set a specific fitness goal, such as walking 10,000 steps or running three times a week. Unfortunately, the app still doesn't support all-day heart-rate tracking or sleep tracking, although there are some third-party options available in the new Wear app store that do. But with Android Wear's challenged battery life, I'm still probably going to keep mine charging at night.\n\nOn-watch workouts\n\nIn addition to tracking daily activities, the new Google Fit app now includes on-watch workouts. It's similar to what we saw on the Fitbit Blaze, but a little more advanced since it can actually count your reps. You can choose from three different exercise challenges: push-ups, sit-ups and squats. The watch will then give you tips on how to do the exercise and show you the proper form.\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nThe idea is to do a little more each day. If you did five push-ups on Monday, you should go for six on Tuesday and then maybe seven on Wednesday.\n\nOverall, I found the rep counting to be accurate, as long as I kept the proper form (itching my nose during a squat gave me an extra rep). The workouts were fine, although I wish there was more of a coaching aspect. I did 20 push-ups, great. Now what? Should I really be doing 20 each day or should I only do it a few times a week? I wish the Google Fit app could provide feedback and recommendations on other workouts I should be doing, rather than simply logging my exercise.\n\nTracking exercises\n\nAnother new (and preinstalled) app is called Fit Workout. The app is used to track a variety of exercises, such as walking, running, biking, treadmill running, stationary biking, aerobics, stair climbing machines and strength training (if your watch has a heart-rate sensor).\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nThe watch can show real-time data for each of these workouts, but it's not great. The data is broken down into three live stats that can be customized with a specific metric, such as heart rate, pace, distance, elapsed time, calories, steps or time of day. That's it. A lot of other watches, such as those from Garmin, let you customize each metric across multiple workout screens. I like to view pace, distance, elapsed time and heart rate when I run. This wasn't possible with the Fit Workout app.\n\nWhere are my friends?\n\nThere are a lot of smartwatches and fitness trackers out there, all at varying price points, but few do fitness tracking better than Fitbit. The app is easy to use and has the largest social base. If one of your friends owns a fitness tracker, there's a good chance it's a Fitbit.\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nThe benefit of this is being able to compete with friends and family members in a variety of competitions, which helps keep you motivated and more likely to reach your goal. Fitbit will also soon be adding a Facebook-like News Feed for even more social interactions.\n\nThere are no social features in Google Fit. You can't see how friends are progressing and you can't compete against them. There is no motivation factor whatsoever. The Apple Watch made small strides with social features in WatchOS 3 fitness. They're not as good as Fitbit, but they're better than Android Wear 2.\n\nNo iOS support\n\nWhile Android Wear is cross-platform, Google Fit isn't. Even though you can use an Android Wear watch with an iPhone, at this time there isn't an iOS app to view your fitness stats. Your only option is to view them on the watch or on the Google Fit website.\n\nMeanwhile, Fitbit offers a web interface and apps for iPhone, Android and even Windows. Granted, Apple Watch has the same issue with its Activity and Workout app, but then again the Apple Watch doesn't support Android. Samsung S-Health, by comparison, can also run across Android, Samsung and iPhone.\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nBetter, but not the best\n\nRunning perfectly on an iPhone isn't a deal breaker. But not working as well as a Fitbit could be. Google Fit has gotten better, but it's still oddly bare-bones on Android Wear and sometimes sluggish when syncing data. Automatic fitness tracking should happen more obviously on-watch and more social connections are a must.\n\nFitness is one of the reasons people are buying smartwatches.

This year more than 1,300 young people from 62 countries took part.\n\nBy the time entries closed, Nji had completed 20 tasks, covering all five categories set by Google. One task alone took a whole week to finish.\n\nAnd then just a day after the deadline for final submissions, the internet went dead.\n\nNji lives in Bamenda in Cameroon's North-West, a journey of about seven hours by road from the capital (according to Google).\n\nIt is an English-speaking region where there are long-held grievances about discrimination and what people see as the Francophone establishment's failure to respect the status of English as an official language of Cameroon.\n\nIn recent months, disgruntlement has escalated into street protests and strikes by lawyers and teachers.\n\nImage caption North-West and South-West are Cameroon's two English-speaking regions\n\nThe authorities have responded with scores of arrests and a text-message campaign warning people of long jail terms for \"spreading false news\" or \"malicious use of social media\".\n\nCutting off the internet, an act still unacknowledged by the government, is seen by rights activists as both punishment and a blunt tool for holding back dissent.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy has Cameroon blocked the internet?\n\nCameroon's victorious footballers mock minister\n\nFor an ambitious, tech-savvy though outwardly unpolitical teenager like Nji, whose school was already closed because of the protests, living without the internet was unthinkable.\n\nAs it was becoming clear that the outage was more than temporary, Nji received some unexpected news - he had been chosen as one of Google's 34 grand prize winners.\n\n\"I was really, really amazed,\" he says. \"It meant my hard work writing a lot of code had really paid off.\"\n\nBut a champion coder without the internet will not stay on top of his game for long. Hence the trip to Yaounde.\n\n\"I wanted to get a connection so I could continue studying and keep in touch with Google,\" says Nji.\n\nImage copyright Nji Collins Gbah\n\nIn due course, he hopes to finish school back in Bamenda, and then study computer science at a good university.\n\nAs part of his prize from Google, Nji will spend four days in June at the tech giant's Silicon Valley headquarters, meeting its top engineers and gaining insight into one of the world's most successful enterprises.\n\n\"Hopefully I would like to work there one day, if that is possible,\" he says.\n\nAt the moment, Nji says he is hard at work building his knowledge of artificial intelligence, neural networks and deep learning.\n\n\"I'm trying to develop my own model for data compression, using deep learning and machine learning,\" he says.\n\nHis eventual goal is a \"huge step\" forward in capabilities for data transfer and storage.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Nji is looking forward to visiting Google's Silicon Valley HQ in the summer, as part of his prize\n\nIn a few days, Nji will turn 18, having already won international recognition for his achievements.\n\nHe admits to having gone back through previous years' Code-in prize announcements to double-check he was the first African winner.\n\nWhen I ask, he says he has received congratulations from \"a lot of friends and family and some people I don't really know\".\n\nHas anyone from the government been in touch?\n\n\"No, no-one,\" he says.\n\nBack in Bamenda, a city of 500,000 and home to one of the continent's brightest young technologists, they wonder when the government will plug the internet back in.", "Cardboard is cheap. Gear VR only works with Samsung phones. The pricy Oculus Rift and HTC Vive require an expensive gaming PC and loads of setup, and the PlayStation VR needs a PS4.\n\nVirtual reality is hard.\n\nBut for $79, £69 or AU$119, Google's new Daydream View could be the break we've been waiting for.\n\nUpdate, January 2017: It's on sale for $49 through February 25, only in the US.\n\nIt's a soft cloth eyebox that turns any compatible phone into a VR headset, and it comes complete with its own Wii-like motion controller for manipulating objects and menus in VR.\n\nIt's the easiest VR to use by far.\n\nBut does that mean you should run out and buy one? Not necessarily. Not yet, anyhow.\n\nEnlarge Image Josh Miller/CNET\n\nMagical but murky\n\nOne of the pitfalls of most VR is the number of cords, ports and things you have to adjust. The Daydream View puts them all to shame. Here are the steps to set it up:\n\nOpen the headset's front door and remove the included controller\n\nTurn on your phone (if it's off) and place it on the door\n\nClose the door, place the headset on your head and adjust until the image looks clear\n\nAdjust the straps\n\nHold down a button on the controller to calibrate, and start playing.\n\nThat's it. No adjusting the lenses, no fiddling with pairing procedures, no ports or cables to plug in. The phone automatically pairs with the headset and adjusts the screen to the correct position, like magic. You can put them on over your glasses with little difficulty, too.\n\nOnce you're inside, the included motion controller makes navigating menus a breeze. Just point where you want to go, and a little mouse cursor follows your motion quickly and accurately.\n\nEnlarge Image Josh Miller/CNET\n\nJust know that \"easy\" doesn't mean \"perfect.\"\n\nWhen I handed the Daydream View to my colleagues, many of them instinctively put it on the wrong way. The curved straps are supposed to rest on top of your head (like a crown) but it's tempting to cinch them down like a pair of ski goggles -- which isn't terribly comfortable.\n\n1:10 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF\n\nAnd though the Daydream View is almost entirely made of soft, cushiony fabric instead of hard plastics, that didn't stop my wife and colleagues from complaining how front-heavy it was with a large Pixel XL phone inside. Even if it weighs less than a pound (roughly 0.85 lbs with the phone) there's still potential for neck strain over time.\n\nThe image quality is good -- I definitely felt like I was somewhere else! -- but it's not going to fool anyone who doesn't want to be fooled. It lets a little bit of light in the edges unless you've got a very wide head. And I often found I had to recalibrate the headset and controller in the middle of a session (it's easy -- just hold down the home button).\n\nI even found a bug that makes VR totally unusable until I reboot the phone -- though I understand a software fix for that is coming soon.\n\n\n\nHere's the rub: unless you have a Google Pixel or other Daydream-certified phone, the Daydream View won't work at all. That's by design: Google's pitch is that Daydream can keep you from getting sick in VR by ensuring both phones and apps meet a certain quality standard.\n\nI haven't gotten sick -- so far.\n\nView full gallery Josh Miller/CNET\n\nBut that means a murky future for Daydream, because we honestly don't know how many phone manufacturers and app developers will wholeheartedly support Google's new platform -- or if the results will be as good as these preliminary ones. Even the 5-inch Pixel offers a lesser experience than the 5.5-inch Pixel XL, because its screen is lower-resolution.\n\nWe tried another upcoming Daydream phone, the Huawei Mate 9, only to find out it may not be Daydream-ready until next year.\n\nUpdate, January 2017: Google has extended support to the Moto Z, and soon the ZTE Axon 7. The Asus Zenfone AR and Huawei Mate 9 Pro (not the Mate 9) will also support Daydream.

Once installed, Charger stole SMS contacts and prompted unsuspecting users to grant it all-powerful administrator rights. If users clicked OK, the malicious app locked the device and displayed the following message:\n\nYou need to pay for us, otherwise we will sell portion of your personal information on black market every 30 minutes. WE GIVE 100% GUARANTEE THAT ALL FILES WILL RESTORE AFTER WE RECEIVE PAYMENT. WE WILL UNLOCK THE MOBILE DEVICE AND DELETE ALL YOUR DATA FROM OUR SERVER! TURNING OFF YOUR PHONE IS MEANINGLESS, ALL YOUR DATA IS ALREADY STORED ON OUR SERVERS! WE STILL CAN SELLING IT FOR SPAM, FAKE, BANK CRIME etc… We collect and download all of your personal data. All information about your social networks, Bank accounts, Credit Cards. We collect all data about your friends and family.\n\nThe app sought 0.2 Bitcoin, currently worth about $180. In an e-mail, Check Point researchers said the app was available in Google Play for four days and had only a \"handful\" of downloads. \"We believe the attackers only wanted to test the waters and not spread it yet,\" the researchers told Ars. The infection was detected by Check Point's mobile malware software, which the company sells to businesses. Google officials have since removed the app and have thanked Check Point for raising awareness of the issue.\n\nHiding in plain sight\n\nAn analysis showed that Charger checked the local settings of an infected device and wouldn't execute the app's malicious payload if the device was located in Ukraine, Russia, or Belarus. The behavior was likely an attempt to prevent the developers from facing legal actions in those countries. In the blog post, Check Point researchers added:\n\nMost malware found on Google Play contains only a dropper that later downloads the real malicious components to the device. Charger, however, uses a heavy packing approach which [makes] it harder for the malware to stay hidden, so it must compensate with other means. The developers of Charger gave it everything they had to boost its evasion capabilities and so it could stay hidden on Google Play for as long as possible. The malware uses several advanced techniques to hide its real intentions and makes it harder to detect. It encodes strings into binary arrays, making it hard to inspect them.\n\nIt loads code from encrypted resources dynamically, which most detection engines cannot penetrate and inspect. The dynamically-loaded code is also flooded with meaningless commands that mask the actual commands passing through.\n\nIt checks whether it is being run in an emulator before it starts its malicious activity. PC malware first introduced this technique which is becoming a trend in mobile malware having been adopted by several malware families including Dendroid.\n\nIn 2012, Google unveiled a cloud-based scanner dubbed bouncer that was billed as a way for the company to detect malicious apps before they were made available in Play. Five years later, discovery of malicious apps like Charger are a regular occurrence. Google makes little reference to the tool these days.", "A Google product manager has filed a lawsuit against the company for its confidentiality policies on the grounds they violate California labor laws, according to a report from The Information. The suit, filed today in California Superior Court in San Francisco, alleges that Google operates what amounts to an internal “spying program” on its own employees.\n\nGoogle encourages employees to report one another to superiors\n\nThese policies are put in place to allegedly prevent the leaking of potentially damaging information to regulators or law enforcement. They in turn prohibit employees from speaking out about illegal activity within the company, even to its own lawyers, and encourage them to report other employees suspected of leaking information. The Verge has obtained a copy of the complaint, linked below in full.\n\n“Google’s motto is ‘don’t be evil.’ Google’s illegal confidentiality agreements and policies fail this test,” the lawsuit reads. One policy allegedly even prevents employees from writing a novel about working for a large Silicon Valley corporation — like, for instance, Dave Eggers’ dystopian novel, The Circle — without first getting final draft approval from Google. The Information confirmed that this lawsuit was filed by the same individual, known in the suit only as “John Doe,” who filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board earlier this year over many of the same confidentiality policies.\n\nThe goal of these confidentiality policies is both to prevent leaking to regulators and law enforcement and to stop employees from handing sensitive information to the press. The suit alleges a Google co-founder — it does not name either Larry Page or Sergey Brin — reiterated at a company all-hands meeting that anyone who leaks confidential info would be terminated.\n\nHowever, if Google is found guilty of violating California labor law, it could be fined up to $100 for each of the 12 alleged violations, multiplied by its more than 61,000 employees. That fine doubles to $200 per pay period per employee, up to an entire year, if any of the violations persisted past a single pay period. That means the maximum payout here could be as much as $3.8 billion, netting each Google employee around $14,600, The Information estimates. The suit specifically calls out a Securities and Exchange Commission guideline that bans companies from preventing their employees from interacting with the agency about potential violations.\n\nGoogle won’t let employees write a novel about working in Silicon Valley without final approval\n\nThe lawsuit says that Google’s Code of Conduct classifies confidential information as “everything at Google.” It also says the company operates a program called “Stop Leaks” that encourages employees to report suspicious behavior, which includes other employees asking detailed questions about projects or other work details. The suit alleges that Google “suppresses information” about potentially illegally products or regulatory-skirting practices by advising employees not to include emails signaling how the company may have broken the law or violated contract terms.\n\nIn a statement obtained by The Verge, a Google spokesperson says the lawsuit is without merit. “We will defend this suit vigorously because it’s baseless. We're very committed to an open internal culture, which means we frequently share with employees details of product launches and confidential business information,” the statement reads. “Transparency is a huge part of our culture. Our employee confidentiality requirements are designed to protect proprietary business information, while not preventing employees from disclosing information about terms and conditions of employment, or workplace concerns.\"\n\nUpdate 11:40AM ET, 12/21: Added statement from Google.", "A Google researcher has uncovered what may be the most worrying web leak of 2017 so far, possibly exposing passwords, private messages and other sensitive data from a vast number of sites, including major services like Uber, FitBit and OKCupid.\n\nIt's being dubbed CloudBleed by some, as the problem was caused by a vulnerability in code from a hugely popular web company, CloudFlare, and was not dissimilar to the infamous Heartbleed bug of 2015 (though possibly more severe in terms of the potential for data leakage). It's similar to Heartbleed in that CloudFlare, which hosts and serves content for a at least 2 million websites, was returning random chunks of memory from vulnerable servers when requests came in.\n\nMaking the issue even more severe was the fact that search engines were caching that leaked information. Another major concern was that CloudFlare typically hosts content from different sites on the same server, so a request to one vulnerable website could reveal information about a separate, unrelated CloudFlare site.\n\n\"For example, you could have visited a page on uber.com, and a chunk of memory from a previous request/response to okcupid.com would be returned,\" explained Pen Test Partners whitehat hacker Andrew Tierney. \"This sensitive data could have been returned to anyone. There was no need to carry out an active attack to obtain the data - my mum may have someone else's passwords stored in her browser cache just by visiting another CloudFlare fronted site.\"\n\nFamous Google bug hunter Tavis Ormandy uncovered the issue, describing it in a brief post, noting that he informed CloudFlare of the problem on February 17. In his own proof-of-concept attack he was able to have the server return encryption keys, passwords and even HTTPS requests of other users from major CloudFlare-hosted sites.\n\nCloudflare have been leaking customer HTTPS sessions for months. Uber, 1Password, FitBit, OKCupid, etc. https://t.co/wjwE4M3Pbk — Tavis Ormandy (@taviso) February 23, 2017\n\nIn a later post, he found the issue to be even more severe: \"I'm finding private messages from major dating sites, full messages from a well-known chat service, online password manager data, frames from adult video sites, hotel bookings. We're talking full HTTPS requests, client IP addresses, full responses, cookies, passwords, keys, data, everything.\"\n\nOrmandy wrote that CloudFlare sent him a draft post that \"severely downplays the risk to customers,\" though he didn't say what he thought about the final public notification that went out Thursday. In that post, CloudFlare wrote: \"The bug was serious because the leaked memory could contain private information and because it had been cached by search engines. We have also not discovered any evidence of malicious exploits of the bug or other reports of its existence.\n\n\"The greatest period of impact was from February 13 and February 18 with around 1 in every 3,300,000 HTTP requests through CloudFlare potentially resulting in memory leakage (that’s about 0.00003 per cent of requests).\" It admitted that the earliest date memory could have leaked was September 22 2016. CloudFlare also said one of its own private keys leaked, one for internal machine-to-machine encryption.\n\nA large list of CloudFlare websites has been uploaded to GitHub, though it's not clear just which ones leaked any data (another list found a handful of affected domains). The user who posted the Github list still recommended users of all those sites change their passwords as a precaution. Security entrepreneur Ryan Lackey recommended the same, though noted it was unlikely the average web user's password was in danger of being stolen.\n\nWhat's the bug?\n\nThe problem lay in the way CloudFlare parsed and modified web pages when a user hit the site. When certain data was sent to the server, it would fail to parse the information properly and cough up sections of memory, jumping over the \"buffer\" designed to keep secret info secure. That memory might have contained sensitive data, like passwords or private communications.\n\nOrmandy found the issue by firing a load of junk data at CloudFlare servers, a process called \"fuzzing.\" In some cases, he received responses that contained information from memory. He could then easily replicate the process to guarantee that sensitive information would be returned.\n\nCloudFlare, Google and other search engine providers have been scouring the web looking for sites that may have leaked information via the CloudBleed bug. They found 161 unique domains where leaked memory had been cached by the search engines, and that data has now been purged. \"We also undertook other search expeditions looking for potentially leaked information on sites like Pastebin and did not find anything,\" CloudFlare added.\n\nRegardless of that cleanup and the continuing efforts of CloudFlare to remove the bug from its customers' servers, Google security researchers like Natalie Silvanovich believe the ultimate impact might be severe.\n\ntl;dr there's no guarantee that private message you sent on OkCupid isn't on the public internet somewhere https://t.co/eZrb85l9ub — Natalie Silvanovich (@natashenka) February 23, 2017\n\nUPDATE Uber says that the impact on its service was very limited. Only a handful of user session tokens were leaked, which could have allowed access to those particular accounts, and they've now been changed. Passwords were not exposed.\n\nAn OKCupid spokesperson said much the same: \"CloudFlare alerted us last night of their bug and we've been looking into its impact on OkCupid members. Our initial investigation has revealed minimal, if any, exposure. If we determine that any of our users has been impacted we will promptly notify them and take action to protect them.\"\n\nFitBit said it was investigating, adding that concerned users can change their account password whenever they wanted. It's encouraging anyone who believes they had an issue to send an email to security@fitbit.com.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that companies may not be able to determine how, when or how many times data was leaked into people's browser caches, or if any attacks took place. CloudFlare could provide some idea of the total impact, though.\n\nCloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince told FORBES that the company had logs for requests that triggered the bug. He said that during the five-day period between February 13 and February 18, every day there were approximately 100,000 requests for the affected 3,500 pages. That meant roughly 500,000 connections could have caused data to leak. For each customer, only \"relatively small amounts of data\" were leaked. That information was passed onto customers so they could determine the impact.\n\nHe explained that the higher traffic customers were more at risk of leaking information. Because customers of CloudFlare share servers, when the vulnerability was triggered it would leak whatever random memory was passing through the system at that time. That would more often be for sites that get more visitors.\n\nAs Prince noted, this problem could have been far worse if Google hadn't issued an alert. \"I think we dodged a bullet there,\" he added. \"[Malicious hackers] could have made hundreds of millions of requests to those pages and pulled a lot of data.\"\n\nGot a tip?

Welcome to the new Pixel phone era.\n\nWith premium features exclusive to Pixel phones and a sales plan that means you might actually find one in a store, the company is showing significantly more ambition than it did with the last six years of Nexus-branded phones.\n\nThe 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL are officially called \"Pixel, a phone by Google\" and have a \"G\" on the back, signifying how Google designed the phones on its own instead of tweaking another company's product into a Nexus. Google is now the one picking components, providing support and promoting the phones.\n\nSo what does that ambition get you?\n\nUnlike last year's mid-range Nexus 5X and premium Nexus 6P, the Pixel phones are both top-shelf models. Google wants you to think of them as rivals to the most prestigious models out there, Apple's iPhones and Samsung Galaxy models. They each have quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processors -- two cores running at 2.15GHz and two at a more battery-efficient 1.6GHz -- with a boost from Qualcomm's Hexagon technology for tasks such as image and audio processing. The phones have OLED screens, 4GB of memory and either 32GB and 128GB of storage space.\n\nStarting at $649 in the US, £599 in the UK and AU$1,079 in Australia, the 32GB Pixel is about the same price as Apple's iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S7. The 128GB model costs $749, £699 or AU$1,229 and the corresponding Pixel XL models cost $769 and $869, £719 and £819 or AU$1269 and AU$1,419. Preorders begin now, with the phone arriving in stores and online on October 20. There's no expandable storage.\n\nStephen Shankland/CNET\n\nGoogle went adverb-happy with the colors: \"very silver,\" \"quite black\" and \"really blue.\" Limited availability means only the US will get the blue version initially. The back of the phone is actually two-tone, with a glossy \"glass shade\" across the top to make antennas work better and a more ordinary bead-blasted metal finish across the bottom. Like the front display, the glass shade employs Gorilla Glass 4 for scratch resistance.\n\nIn the hand, the Pixel's metal-and-glass body definitely feels a step above Google's previous Nexus handsets, with fewer exposed seams. The smooth aluminum makes for a premium, iPhone-like feel, but with chamfered edges that make it a bit less slippery.\n\nEnlarge Image James Martin/CNET\n\nAnd while the glass shade might look a little odd, it feels pretty good to the touch, adding a bit of tacky grip. The fingerprint reader also rests neatly under one's index finger, like last year's Nexus smartphones. And I particularly like how Google weighted these phones: they've got some nice solid heft without feeling too heavy like many all-metal phones, or so light (like the Nexus 5X) that they feel hollow.\n\nA few features will help the phones stand out from other models powered by Google's Android software. They'll be the only ones to include Google Assistant, a new beefed-up version of Google's conversational system to control the phone and answer questions -- Google's rival to Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana and Amazon's Alexa. It'll also store all photos and video in original resolution for the life of the phone, shuttling older shots to cloud storage if you run out of room. And if you need to call Google's support, a technician will be able to remotely control your phone. Android 7.1 -- the latest version of Nougat -- debuts with the Pixels.\n\nStephen Shankland/CNET\n\nUnlike the iPhone 7, the Pixel phones retain a 3.5 mm headphone jack -- but Pixels come with no headphones, because really, don't you already have some?\n\nThere's no camera bump, but the Pixels aren't the thinnest phone around. They're slightly wedge-shaped, tapering from 8.6 mm at the top end to 7.4 mm at the bottom. The Pixel is 69.5 mm wide by 143.8 mm tall (2.73 by 5.66 inches), while the Pixel XL is 75.7 by 154.7 mm (2.98 by 6.09 inches). Screen resolutions are 1,920x1080 at 441 pixels per inch for the Pixel and 2,560x1,440 at 534ppi for the XL.\n\nBased on a brief test, it seems Google has made good on its promise that the main 12-megapixel camera performs much faster than last year's Nexus models -- see CNET's in-depth look at the Pixel camera for more detail. Another useful feature of Android 7.1 is that there's no more long pause when you rotate the phone from portrait to landscape orientation. The company stuck with Sony for the camera's sensor but promises faster autofocus. There's no optical image stabilization like in the iPhone 7 -- nor are there the dual rear cameras of the iPhone 7 Plus -- but Google thinks its fast image processing will do the trick when trying to compensate for your unsteady shooting.\n\nThe front-facing camera has an 8-megapixel sensor, and twisting the phone back and forth switches to it from the main camera.\n\nStephen Shankland/CNET\n\nThe fingerprint reader on the center of the back gets a new trick, too: if you swipe down on it, it shows your notifications even as it unlocks the phone.\n\nThe Pixels, like the Nexus models of 2015, use the newer USB Type-C port for data links and charging. When watching video or browsing the internet, battery life should be 13 hours for the Pixel and 14 for the Pixel XL. The batteries can't be removed.\n\nAnd careful by the pool, because the Pixel phones are only rated to IP53 when it comes to dust and liquid resistance -- good enough to handle a splash and some rain, not a full dunk like the Samsung and Apple flagship phones can.\n\nGoogle is leaning on HTC to assemble the phone. The Taiwanese manufacturer has a long history with Google, building the first-ever Android phone, the T-Mobile G1 \"Dream\" that debuted in 2008, and the Nexus One that inaugurated the Nexus line in 2010. Google has also partnered with Samsung, LG Electronics, Motorola and Huawei to build Nexus phones.\n\nAndroid partnerships remain. But there's no more pussyfooting around here -- Google is competing directly against Samsung and other partners who use Google's Android software.", "There's an old football saying: When you have two starting quarterbacks, you have none. I've watched the New York Jets go through a lot of seasons with a lot of quarterbacks on the roster, but no single hero.\n\nI just spent a week with Google's new Android Wear 2.0 software update on two different watches, and I feel like Android Wear is in the same boat. There are a lot of Android Wear watches to choose from, and many of them will get updates to Android Wear 2.0. The problem is, there is no flagship Android watch.\n\nSure, there are plenty of Android phones. But from 2010 to 2015, Google had delivered a Nexus phone -- in 2016 it released its first wholly designed-phone, the Pixel -- to demonstrate every year what it feels is the ideal Android experience.\n\nThe Pixel phones took things a step further with a fantastic polished design. They're part of a new wave of Google products designed, engineered and branded by Google, including the Google Home and Chromecasts. But Android Wear still feels outside that loop.\n\nLG's newest Android Wear watches are designed along with Google's input. They're collaborative products, to a degree. But the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style aren't quite hero Android Wear smartwatches. Google won't confirm whether a Pixel watch is in the works, but it doesn't take a soothsayer to read the tea leaves. Former Motorola head Rick Osterloh now leads Google's hardware team, and that team's intention is to build products.\n\nIt's hard enough to recommend smartwatches right now, but having one singular model to point to helps. Microsoft took that approach with its Surface laptops. Apple has one basic design for the Apple Watch, and most models perform the same tasks. Samsung honed its smartwatch vision to one Gear S2 design with variations on its theme.\n\nGoogle has many, many Android Wear smartwatches made by many companies. Some have Android Pay. Some track your heart rate. Some have built-in GPS. Some have Dick Tracy-esque speakerphones. Some can access the internet even if not synced to a phone. Different models have different buttons and crowns, which means there's no uniform way of using them.\n\n2:37 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF\n\nLG's Style and Sport are the newest watches to work with Android Wear, but I wouldn't wear either one. The Style goes for thin design over battery life, Android Pay and GPS functions. The Sport adds GPS and even a stand-alone LTE-connected phone, but at a size and design I wouldn't want. The Android Wear watch I'd prefer would be something between these two. Maybe that exists in previous watch models such as the Huawei Watch, but finding the perfect fit isn't easy.\n\nA Pixel watch could consolidate features and show off the core functions together in a tight design. Android Pay, absolutely. Hopefully, no serious compromise on battery. A new, spinning side crown button, like LG's models. Optional GPS. But most importantly, keep the design compact. The Apple Watch's design success is that most models function nearly identically, and they're all relatively small -- they don't look too weird on anyone. A Pixel watch could combine essential features. Understanding the minute differences in Android Wear watches gets tiring, and stores don't necessarily stock all models.\n\nRight now, Android Wear's software is getting better. There are still more Apple Watches sold than Android Wear watches, despite all the companies making them. Maybe Google should focus on fewer, better watches. Or just one amazing Pixel watch.\n\nIt worked for phones and for the Home. Watches could use the love, too, and it might help Google to pinpoint where Android Wear goes next.", "Did you just get a Google Home speaker for the holidays? This stubby little speaker is about to become your best friend. By yelling out \"OK Google!\" you'll be able to set timers, play music, have it control a Chromecast connected to a TV, or tell you the phone number of the nearest Walgreens. Here's how to set it up.\n\n1. Plug in your Google Home\n\nYour Google Home plugs into the wall and, after a few minutes, will light up and start looking for your phone. There's no on/off button. It's always on when it's plugged in. Stay nearby with your phone.\n\n2. Download the Google Home app from your phone's app store and open the app\n\nDownload from Google Play or the App Store. Accept the terms of service, and agree to turn on location permissions. Yes, Google's spying on you. By having the Google Home, you're all in. Might as well let it know where you are. Make sure you are connected to your home Wi-Fi network, as your phone will pass that information to the Google Home.\n\n3. Sign in with a Google account\n\nYou'll need a Google account to use Google Home; preferably one with a gmail.com address. If you don't have one, now's the time to pop open your browser on your PC, go to Gmail.com, and set one up.\n\n4. Don't allow email notifications\n\nWe don't need more spam. You're going to have to do this twice.\n\n5. Tap the setup icon in the upper right-hand corner\n\nNow, tap Sign In and set the location of your Google Home hardware. The speaker needs to do this so it can give you local weather and commute times.\n\n6. Link your music service\n\nGoogle Home supports four music services: Google Play Music, YouTube, Spotify, and Pandora. To get the most out of it, you need a Google Play Music or Spotify premium account. Those will let you request specific songs and albums. With the free services, you'll only be able to listen to themed stations or artist mixes. Google Home can't access your purchased or local music libraries.\n\n7. Step through the tutorial\n\nNow you'll get some tips on how to use the Google Home, and fun things to ask it. My daughter likes to ask it how to spell words when she's doing her homework.\n\n8. Tap the left-hand menu button, then More Settings\n\nLet's set up some of the optional features on the Google Home. You can get to them through the menu accessed by tapping the three-line icon in the upper left hand corner. Tap More settings to see the full list.\n\n9. Change your news and My Day settings\n\nWhen you say \"listen to the news\" or \"tell me about my day,\" you can get customized information from your Google Home. Tapping News, then Customize, lets you change your news sources—for instance, from NPR to Fox News. Tapping My Day lets you change a few options in the daily briefing.\n\n10. Change what the Google Home calls you\n\nScroll all the way down and choose \"Personal Info,\" then \"Nickname,\" to change what Google Home calls you and how to pronounce it. Yes, you can have it call you \"Boss\" or \"Colonel.\"\n\n11. Enter your commute locations\n\nIf you want the Google Home to give you accurate commute times, under \"Personal info,\" choose \"Home & work locations.\" Enter the address of your home and office. Then you can ask it \"how long is my commute?\"\n\n12. Add home electronics\n\nGoogle Home is compatible with Philips Hue lightbulbs, Nest thermostats, Samsung SmartThings, and Chromecasts. Tap Home Control to add a new Nest, Hue or SmartThings device. For you to add or control these items, they all have to be on the same Wi-Fi network.\n\n13. Add Chromecast devices\n\nGoogle Home needs a Chromecast, or a Chromecast-compatible TV, to control your TV. Plug your Chromecast into the TV and switch to the appropriate input. When the Chromecast tells you on the TV to switch to the Google Home app, tap the \"devices\" icon at the upper right-hand corner of the main screen to set up the Chromecast. You'll need to tie it to the same Google account used by your Google Home. You can then use your voice to control various music, video, and photo services, like \"OK Google, play Christmas music\" via Spotify or Google Play Music or \"OK Google, play Stranger Things\" via Netflix.\n\n14. Control Google Home by voice and touch\n\nCurious about what to ask? Look in your Google Home app. Tap the menu button on the upper left and choose \"What can you do?\" for some suggestions. To change the volume, make a dialing motion on the top surface of the Google Home, or say, \"OK Google, volume \" and a number from one to 11. Have fun chatting with Google!", "Google and Amazon have both launched holiday promotions for their online movie rental services. You can head over to Google Play and grab any title (including a number of recent blockbusters) for $0.99, or do the same at Amazon Video using the promo code “MOVIE99.” In both cases, you can only get one movie per account, and you have until January 23rd 2017 to redeem the offer. So, if you don’t fancy using it up for Christmas, you can always wait until the New Year.\n\nBoth Google and Amazon have a number of recent blockbusters on offer, including Suicide Squad and Jason Bourne, as well as holiday classics like Elf. Amazon also has the likes of The Magnificent Seven (the remake), Sully, Bridget Jones’s Baby, and Finding Dory, while Google has titles like The Lego Movie, Now You See Me, and Home Alone. Google is also offering 50 percent off other new titles to buy, including Kubo and the Two Strings and Star Trek: Beyond.", "2:20 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF\n\nNaturally, you only ever misplace the most important things in your life -- and usually when you need them the most.\n\nIf you're prone to losing important items or documents, worry no more. Google Home can remember where you stored your passport or where you put your spare keys. All you have to do is ask.\n\nHere's how it works.\n\nOK Google, remember everything\n\nGoogle Home's \"remember\" feature works best for remembering something about specific items, like where you put it or what it is. The more simple you make it, the easier it will be to recall later. Just say something like:\n\n\"OK Google, remember that I put my passport in the bottom drawer of my filing cabinet.\"\n\n\"OK Google, remember that my spare key to the truck is hidden outside.\"\n\n\"OK Google, remember that Alex has my wallet.\"\n\n\"OK Google, remember that my password is money.\"\n\nGoogle Home will confirm that it will remember what you told it by speaking it back to you.\n\nSadly, this feature is specific to Google Home and won't work with Google Assistant in other places, like Allo or on Pixel phones.\n\nRecalling remembered items\n\nWhen you want to recall where you last put something, just ask Google where that item is or what you said about it. For instance, say something like:\n\n\"OK Google, where is my passport?\"\n\n\"OK Google, what did I tell you about my wallet?\"\n\n\"OK Google, what is my password?\"\n\nThe remember feature of Google Home works best for items. However, if you get creative, you can use it to remember other things, such as when you last did something. For example:\n\n\"OK Google, remember that I watered the hermit crabs this morning.\"\n\n\"OK Google, remember that I called mom today.\"\n\nRecalling these remembered items is the tricky part. You have to pay special attention to how you phrase your command. To recall when I called my mom last, I had to say, \"OK Google, what did I tell you about 'called mom'?\" It's very unnatural to say and, grammatically, it makes no sense. But it works.\n\nFor the hermit crabs, it's much more natural. Just say, \"OK Google, what did I tell you about the hermit crabs?\"\n\nRecalling the items you've told Google Home to remember can be finicky at times, especially if you can't remember how you originally phrased the commands. To recall everything you've told Google Home to remember, say \"OK Google, what did I tell you to remember?\"\n\nForgetting remembered items\n\nSecurity is pretty low on a device like Google Home, so if you've told Google to remember something sensitive, you may also want it to forget that information at some point.\n\nUnfortunately, managing everything you've told Google Home to remember is clunky at best. The only way to find out everything you've had Google remember is to ask. There's no way to manage it in the Google Home app.\n\nYou also have to delete the reminders for each remembered item individually, so it may take some time. Say, \"OK Google, forget what I told you about my password.\" Google will stop storing anything you've told it to remember about that item.", "Google Maps is today rolling out a new feature to all users on iOS and Android devices that will allow you to make lists of places that you can star, save and share with friends. There are three different lists types built in at launch – “Favorites,” “Starred Places,” and “Want to Go” – the latter which is designed to serve as a personal bucket list. However, you can also create your own custom lists which can be public, private, or shared with a link.\n\nThe feature has been in testing since this past fall among Google’s power users, Google Local Guides, and was built off the starring functionality that’s been available in Google Maps for over five years.\n\nBeing able to create and share lists of places could give Google Maps a more social feel to it. That’s an area that Google wants to explore, notes Maps lead product manager, Zach Maier.\n\nBefore, he says, Maps has been focused on getting people from point A to point B without getting lost. Now, “we want to help people break out of their routine, and do something new,” he explains.\n\nTo use the lists option, you tap the “Save” button that appears on the detail page for the location in question, whether that’s a business – like a restaurant, bar, or shop – or anything else. It can even be a drop pin you place on the map itself, Maier said. That’s helpful for marking specific destinations that aren’t otherwise discoverable in Google Maps, like a particular spot within a large, local park.\n\nIt seems like Starred places and Favorites could have some overlap, but the intention with Stars is to allow users to save a personal list of places they need to reference, that aren’t necessarily those they would call “Favorites.” For example, a doctor’s office or school might be Starred, but not favorited.\n\nDuring testing, users could create lists for themselves, but with today’s launch these can be shared and followed, too.\n\nSo if you make a list of the best restaurants in your city, you can make it discoverable by any user on Google Maps by setting the list to public. Or, if you’re making a list to be shared with just one person or a group of friends – like a travel itinerary or local recommendations catering to someone’s particular interests – that list can be shared via a link instead.\n\nClicking the link will display the list, and with another click you can choose to follow it as well. This will allow you to pull up the list and keep track of its updates at any time, as long as you’re logged into your Google account.\n\nGoogle hasn’t partnered with any brands or publishers on the launch to seed the service with interesting and useful public lists, but Maier didn’t rule out the possibility in the future. Today, Google already works with several companies, like NYT, USA Today, Michelin, and Google-owned Zagat, for instance, to augment its search results with more information, including links to those brands’ own lists. It would make sense to bring them to Google Maps at some point, too.\n\nThe new feature will compete head-on with Foursquare, which has offered list-making tools for some time, as well as with smaller startups like Soon, Spot, and the zillions of other “bucket list” making tools on the App Store.\n\nGoogle’s public lists won’t yet be searchable, in the same way that Foursquare’s are, but your own lists will pop up as suggestions when you begin to type in the search box. Your lists and those you follow are also available offline.\n\nGoogle says the new feature is rolling out today on iOS and Android, and lists will be viewable on the web through shared links. The full list-making experience will come to the web and other platforms at a later point.", "Google News this week launched a fact check feature that will be displayed in searches for news stories. The feature, announced on Thursday, launches amid a US presidential election that has been marred by misinformation and outright lies, most glaringly from Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nThe \"fact check\" label will now appear in expanded story boxes on the Google News website and mobile apps, alongside other labels such as \"opinion\" and \"highly cited.\" It is currently available for users in the US and UK. Google uses its Claim Review process to algorithmically determine whether a fact check is relevant to a given story, and highlights sources that \"follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks.\" It is not clear how many fact check sites have been included in Google's system, though the company invited sites to apply in a blog post published yesterday.\n\n\"We’re excited to see the growth of the Fact Check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin,\" Richard Gingras, Google's head of news, wrote in the blog post.\n\nAs The Guardian notes, Facebook has yet to deploy any fact-checking systems, despite being an increasingly important source of news. The social network has come under criticism in recent months for continually promoting fake news stories through its \"Trending Topics\" algorithm.", "Image: Alex Cranz/Mario Aguilar/Gizmodo\n\nOur peaceful homes are being invaded by talking Bluetooth speakers and there’s nothing you can do about it—so you might as well enlist the help of these AI-powered hubs and get them to do your bidding. Here’s how to set up your own custom voice commands on Google Home or the Amazon Echo.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe easiest option, which works best for most users, is to enlist the help of our old friend IFTTT (If This Then That), which has introduced channels for both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, the bots powering the Home and Echo respectively. If you want to get more involved you can do, and we’ll cover some more advanced options further down the page.\n\nUsing IFTTT\n\nImage: Screenshot\n\nFor the uninitiated, IFTTT lets you connect certain services and apps with other services and apps, through the power of applets. Each applet has a trigger and an action, and that means you can connect all kinds of functions to your Amazon Echo or Google Home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake a look at the Assistant and Alexa channels to see some of the applets made by Google and Amazon themselves. Turn on your Philips Hue lights, turn on your TV, post to Facebook, find your phone, and so on and so on.\n\nImage: Screenshot\n\nWhen you’re ready to build your own applet—assuming you’ve registered for and signed into IFTTT—open the drop-down menu to the right and choose New Applet. Choose Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa as the trigger, and you’re then prompted to connect IFTTT to your own personal accounts.\n\n\n\nFor Google Assistant, your triggers can be a simple phrase, or a phrase with a key word or a key number. That lets you, for example, specify a contact name or a certain figure you want to dial into your Nest thermostat.\n\n\n\nSponsored\n\nWith Amazon Alexa, you can set up your own phrase as a trigger, but it’s not quite as flexible as the Assistant channel yet. You can however use a shopping list action, like an item being added, as one of your triggers.\n\nWhen you’ve set up the “if this” part of your applet, you can then move on to the “then that” bit, and thanks to IFTTT’s broad channel support, there’s plenty to choose from. Your newly created voice command can interact with the likes of Facebook, Evernote, Google Drive, Strava, and a ton of wearables and smart home gadgets.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere’s a lot of choice but here’s just one idea. Set up a voice command on your Google Home or Amazon Echo that sends an SMS from your Android phone, wherever it is.\n\nUsing developer tools\n\nImage: Google\n\nIFTTT is simple and straightforward to use but if you want to go further with your Echo or Home hacking then you need to put on a developer hat and do some coding. It’s a lot more technical but of course there are many more possibilities.\n\nAmazon offers developer tools and step-by-step tutorials for creating your own skills. Here’s one for creating a trivia game that works with Alexa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle isn’t quite as far down the line with developers as Amazon is, and it uses “actions” instead of “skills”. The Actions on Google platform has just been launched and you can find a wealth of resources and options there.", "Remember when Google announced Google Home? Yeah, you probably don't — it was back in May at the company's annual developer event, Google I/O.\n\nI remember it distinctly, both because I was covering the event and because I was so excited by the product. An Amazon Echo-esque speaker/mic combination, powered by Google? That's literally exactly what I wanted.\n\nMy only hesitation with buying the Echo — other than the whole \"voluntarily buying an internet-connected listening device for my home\" — was the lack of deep Google integration.\n\nGoogle is my internet backbone. I use Google Contacts to move my contacts from phone to phone, I use Google Messenger for text messaging, Google Voice for work, Google Keep for notes. We use Google Calendar here at Business Insider for meetings, and I use it in my personal life as well — the same goes for Google Docs. I chat with colleagues from other publications throughout the day using Google Hangouts (sorry, boss!)\n\nSo when Google Home was announced, I was ready for it.\n\nThe product re-emerged five months later alongside Google's new Pixel phone, packed with Google Assistant and ready to ship in November. I immediately plunked down $140.45 (with tax — it costs $129), and received a unit a few weeks later.\n\nIt had problems right from the start.\n\nI downloaded the Home app to my Nexus 5X and expected a seamless experience. Not only am I using an Android phone, but I'm using an Android phone made by Google. It's not the new Pixel, but it came out in 2015 — not exactly eons ago.\n\nWhat I encountered was a frustrating setup process that only worked when the app seemingly felt like working.\n\nOver and over, the WiFi broke, rendering the device entirely useless. And if it's not connected to your home WiFi network, you can't do anything with Google Home — no Google requests, no music, nothing.\n\nThis happened repeatedly across two weeks. I have a standard home WiFi network, with a highly-rated dual-band Asus router and an Arris Surfboard modem (that I own/don't rent from my ISP). I live in a small-ish Brooklyn apartment — the Home sits about 15 feet from my router. At any point, there are a maximum of six wireless devices in my home connected to the internet (and, more commonly, two or three). I even contacted Google's press line for help (the company also sent me a review unit, which I experienced the same problems with) to no avail.\n\nWhen Google Home does work, it's worryingly limited.\n\nIt can't set reminders (\"Sorry, create reminder is not yet supported.\").\n\nIt can't give directions or transit warnings (\"Sorry, I can't give directions for public transit yet.\").\n\nIt seemingly has no idea that I have a personal or work calendar (\"Sorry, I'm not sure how to help with that yet.\")\n\nThis is all stuff that Google Now does on my phone right now. In fact, Google Now is part of why I continue to use Android.\n\nEvery time it tells me something useful before I even realized I needed to know it — my boarding gate for tomorrow's flight, for instance, and then if there's traffic on the way to the airport — I marvel at its usefulness. Google Now is a strong argument for an entire phone OS.\n\nInstead, Google Home is powered by a new AI assistant from Google called, \"Google Assistant.\" The sell point with Google Assistant is it can do conversation-like stuff. Ask it, \"Ok Google, how far is Mars from Earth?\" and it gives you the answer. Then you can ask, \"How about Pluto?\"\n\nPresumably, if all goes perfectly, Google Assistant will keep the conversation going with an answer, passively understanding all the context in between. But in reality, this is something I rarely use. I need Google Home to do stuff for me — set appointments in my calendar, warn me that my train is going to be late so I should leave earlier, tell me about that concert I might've forgotten about. I need it to do stuff that Google Now already does successfully — at bare minimum.\n\nIn this respect, it's a terrible assistant.\n\nThe other thing it's supposed to do — be a speaker — is just okay. I have a Sonos Play 3 speaker, which is really, really good. It's loud, and has stunning bass depth considering how small it is. It's also significantly more expensive than Google Home ($299 compared to Home's $129). With that price comes a gigantic increase in quality — Home sounds tinny and cheap by comparison.\n\nIn the end, I returned my Google Home soon after buying it.\n\nIf I can't trust it to consistently work, what's the point? It was already a luxury purchase — a lark on a brand new type of technology — and ended up being one that I couldn't justify spending $140 on.\n\nMaybe I'd like the Amazon Echo much more, and maybe I'll give it a shot eventually, but in the meantime I'm gonna wait for AI technology to improve dramatically.\n\nGet the latest Google stock price here.", "Google has a long way to go before it matches Amazon's smart home presence, and the hardest step is often the first. So today's announcement by Belkin -- that its WeMo line of smart home products will work with Google Home and Google Assistant -- might not be surprising, but it is a critical early step for the platform.\n\nPractically, Belkin's announcement means Google Home owners can pick up Belkin WeMo products and use them with \"Hey, Google\" commands.\n\nThe news comes on the heels of Google announcing its expansion of Weave, the language that lets Google Home \"talk\" to smart home devices like the Nest Thermostat. According to this earlier announcement, Weave will soon connect devices by Belkin, Lifx, Honeywell, Wink, TP-Link, and First Alert. This was important news, considering Google Home's partnerships were so meager at its release -- limited to Nest, SmartThings, Philips Hue and IFTTT.\n\nTyler Lizenby/CNET\n\nBut in the tech world, \"soon\" can mean almost anything; just look at Apple HomeKit 's tortuous history. So it's encouraging for Google Home early adopters to see \"soon\" mean \"now.\" You can now control your Belkin WeMo smart plugs and switches using Google Home and Google Assistant commands. It's a small step, but a vital one.\n\nBelkin's announcement also bodes well for the other partnerships coming \"soon\" to Weave. Perhaps controlling your Lifx, Honeywell, Wink, TP-Link, and First Alert devices by saying, \"Hey Google,\" isn't so far-fetched.\n\nWith multiple years comfortably under its belt, Amazon Echo has enjoyed a significant head start in the voice automation market. But Belkin's announcement signals an end to Echo's de facto dominance: 2016 will be the last year the smart home market is won by default.", "I've been using Google's Pixel XL smartphone for a few weeks, and the experience has highlighted the absence of some key features on the iPhone. You should note that everything here is subjective. The iPhone has great features that the Pixel doesn't have, and the Apple ecosystem is in a league of its own. But damn the Pixel is good. You should also note that I'm comparing the Pixel XL experience with my iPhone 6s and not the iPhone 7 series. That's because I have more experience with the 6s Plus, as it has been my phone for the past nine months. The iPhone 6s Plus isn't that much different, as a whole, however, from the iPhone 7. The performance between the two phones is still comparable, and the iPhone 7's camera upgrades aren't as important as some of the Pixel's more functional features. Check out what I think makes the Pixel a better phone than the iPhone: View As: One Page Slides\n\nThe Pixel is lighter. My iPhone 6s Plus' weight (192 grams) never bothered me until I picked up the Google Pixel XL (168 grams). The iPhone 7 Plus is slightly lighter than the 6s Plus at 188 grams, but that's a difference of only 4 grams, so I'd still consider the 7 heavy compared with the Pixel. The Pixel's lighter weight has no ill effect on its reliability, and it's easier to manage in your hands.\n\nThe Pixel's screen is stunning. In the above photo (taken with the Pixel, by the way), the Pixel XL and the iPhone 6s Plus are showing the same photo on full brightness. The iPhone's LCD screen is nice, but the colors aren't as rich, and the contrast isn't as pronounced, as on the Pixel's display. The Pixel's design is more utilitarian than it is beautiful, but its sharper AMOLED screen outshines the iPhone's Retina display. The iPhone 7 Plus has a 1080p screen that's fine and sharp enough, but the Pixel's 1440p screen is sharper. More important, the Pixel's AMOLED screen makes everything it displays look better than on the iPhone's LCD display. Pictures, videos, and apps pop with inky blacks and vibrant (but not oversaturated) colors on the Pixel, which makes for a more premium and modern look overall.\n\nThe Pixel has a clever way to add grip. I don't like cases, but I have to use one for my iPhone. As nice as the iPhone's metal back and edges are, they don't offer any grip, and I've dropped and dinged my iPhone a couple of times as a result. The glass inlay on the Pixel's back doesn't look particularly nice (it looks better on the white model), but it's actually a great grip for your index finger, which makes the Pixel feel more secure in your hands.\n\nFast charging. Above, SuperSaf TV, a tech YouTube channel, tested the charging times of the Pixel XL, the iPhone 7 Plus, and the Galaxy S7 Edge with the chargers included in each phone's packaging. The Pixel XL is nearly 100% charged after two hours of charging, while the iPhone 7 Plus is dragging its feet at 72%. The Galaxy S7 wiped the floor with the other two, having charged to 100% after an amazing one hour, 29 minutes. Charging speed is actually a huge deal. The Pixel's USB-C fast charging is faster than the iPhone's comparatively slow charging, and it's one of the harder things to adjust to when switching back to the iPhone.\n\nI can choose to make the Pixel work faster. I can adjust Android to make it feel faster than iOS by cutting down, or removing altogether, the animations when I open apps and swipe between screens. Apple's iOS has a \"Reduce Motion\" option, but it seems to only change the default zoom-in and zoom-out animations when opening and closing apps to fade-in and fade-out animations. Apps don't appear to open or close any faster.\n\nPixel has better battery life, thanks to Android. Android's Doze feature is exceptionally effective. It does a fantastic job of reducing the Pixel's power consumption when I'm not using it compared with iOS on my iPhone.\n\nThe Pixel is slightly smaller but has the same size of screen. The difference is slight, but it's there and noticeable on a device you hold and use multiple times a day. The iPhone is in the lower end in terms of screen-to-bezel ratio (67.7%) compared with the Pixel XL (71.2%).", "Early 2017 update\n\nThe Google Pixel remains our favorite phone, bar none -- unless you're looking for a bigger screen, in which case we'd recommend its big brother, the Pixel XL.\n\nThe Pixel strikes a terrific balance between speed and beauty, ergonomics and straight-up usability. It's the purest vehicle for Android Nougat 7.0, Google's mobile operating system. It's a relatively quick-charger. And it offers the most seamless integration with Google's Daydream View VR headset (though the list of compatible phones continues to grow).\n\nOf course, the Pixel isn't perfect; the rear panel's glass treatment may be an aesthetic misfire for some, and it's vulnerable to cracking. It's also not as water-resistant as others, and though its camera is superb, the iPhone 7 Plus delivers superior video quality in portrait mode (read more about how the two stack up). Still, these are mostly minor quibbles; if you're looking for an alternative to the latest model iPhones, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL are worth a serious look.\n\nLooking ahead, Google hasn't officially stated anything yet about the future of the Pixel line, but there are rumors swirling about innovative AR and VR developments and, possibly, a foldable display. But with the next Pixel not expected before October 2017 (a year after the original debuted), Android fans may be tempted by the Samsung Galaxy S8, which is rumored to be hitting in March or April.\n\nEditors' note, February 16, 2017: The original Google Pixel review, first published in October 2016, follows.\n\nWith the Pixel, Google stepped up to bat, called its shot, and knocked it out of the park. If there was any lingering doubt about Google's capacity to step out on its own, it's gone. Sure, HTC may have put the phones together, but Google designed, engineered, and branded them. And the timing couldn't be more fortunate with Samsung still emerging from the hangover of a very difficult 2016.\n\nView full gallery Jason Cipriani/CNET\n\nStarting at $649 in the US, £599 in the UK and AU$1,079 in Australia, the Pixel is fast, with an elevated, smooth design. Heavy investments in its camera resulted in a nimble shooter too. Though its special portrait mode is poor, it otherwise takes amazing shots that rival those of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus.\n\nIt's also the first phone to have the search giant's new, thoroughly robust voice-and-search service, called Google Assistant, built in. It's the most natural voice assistant I've experienced, and comes closest to giving me that Jarvis from \"Iron Man\" experience all these assistants appear to be chasing.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge may still be the most visually striking phone on the market. But, if you're wary of Samsung phones, the Pixel -- a strong contender for the best premium Android phone -- makes a terrific alternative.\n\nWhy the Pixel is one of the best Android phones right now\n\nSo what's so great about the Pixel? Aside from the premium hardware, like the camera and processor, it packs new software features that are handy to use day-to-day. Read on to find out more.\n\nThe camera is (mostly) awesome\n\nAs you can tell from its name, Google makes a big deal about the Pixel's camera, and it is superb. It takes even better shots than the already stellar iPhone 7 Plus, which I consider to be the reigning champion of camera phones. If you want the full scoop on how these two compare, check out CNET's feature, Google Pixel vs. iPhone 7 Plus: Which camera is better?\n\nThe camera is fast, images are in focus, and colors look vibrant. Close-up shots appear especially sharp and refined. Landscape scenes retain an impressive amount of detail and depth, even with objects that are far away.\n\nEnlarge Image Josh Miller/CNET\n\nPhotos taken in dim lighting understandably weren't as sharp and had more digital artifacts. But the camera did a good job at capturing available light and brightening up scenes. The flash made skin tones look natural as well, and if it hadn't been for a few reflections in eyes, it would've been hard to tell in the photos that it was even used.\n\nThe front-facing camera is excellent, too. It has a wide enough lens to fit a lot of content (read: faces) in each frame, and it softened skin tones enough to look appealing without appearing too airbrushed. To see the images I captured, check out the slideshow below.\n\nThe camera can shoot 4K video, and though it doesn't have optical image stabilization, it uses a combination of the gyroscope and software to steady your videos all the same. This feature works well, and it's useful when you're moving while recording footage. But it does give your videos a sort of surreal, almost drone-like quality.\n\nGoogle Assistant helps organize your day\n\nThe Pixel is deeply integrated with Google's search services, and it's the first hardware device to have Google Assistant baked in. Assistant is an AI bot that uses machine learning and Google's vast search database to answer all kinds of questions you throw its way. It can schedule reminders, look up facts and places to eat, set alarms, give directions, translate phrases and more. And the more you use it, the more it's supposed to learn about you and become more personalized.\n\nUnlike Google Now (the company's previous iteration of a digital assistant), Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana, Assistant is genuinely conversational. You can use your voice to speak to it in a natural, back-and-forth way, and it has a chat-like interface. After every interaction, there are suggested follow-up queries you can tap on to keep the conversation going.\n\nEnlarge Image Lynn La/CNET\n\nLike with most voice assistants, you forget that they're there. But when you do remember, Assistant can be useful. It doesn't hear every question correctly every time, but when it does, it works relatively quickly. Compared to Siri, which sort of checks out after it finishes each task, Assistant builds upon my previous queries, so it made me interact with it longer.\n\nAndroid Nougat packs some sweetness\n\nThe device runs a pure version of Android 7.1 Nougat. It's the first to have Google's messaging service Allo Duo\n\nLauncher shortcuts, aka Google's take on Apple's 3D Touch\n\nYou can send GIFs inside Google Keyboard, for all your GIF-fy delights.\n\nTo reduce eye strain from viewing a bright, bluish display at night, there's a Night Light setting that tints the screen yellow. (Other Android phones and the iPhone already do this.)\n\nOn the back is a fingerprint reader for added user security and services such as Android Pay. It works quickly, and as a bonus you can use it to slide down notifications on the screen.\n\nIt looks and feels great\n\nThe Pixel and Pixel XL are nearly identical, but the latter has a bigger, sharper display and a bumped-up battery. Other than that, they're pretty much the same. Both are polished and well crafted, and their sleek, one-piece aluminum design make them more elegant than previous Nexus devices.", "Google’s making it way easier and simpler to hail an Uber with Google Maps. Today the company announced that the latest version of Google Maps on Android and iOS lets users request a ride from Uber without ever leaving the app. Previously, you could use Maps to check for price estimates and start the process of getting a lift, but eventually you had to finish things up in the Uber app. Now, the entire request process takes place directly in Google Maps. You just sign in with your Uber account info, which pulls up your stored payment info and other details.\n\nThe “ride services” section of Maps, as Google calls it, has been given a makeover with this new release. Instead of a list of services (Uber, Lyft, etc.) with pricing beside each one, now you’ll see the traditional on-screen map with a visual representation of where nearby drivers are. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem as though you can fully hail Lyft rides in-app for the time being.\n\nUber would probably prefer you stick with its redesigned app — and many people probably instinctively do that anyway instead of using Google Maps for requesting rides. But if you’re not a fan of the new Uber’s look or its very aggressive location tracking, well, now you’ve got a pretty convenient alternative. Google says the new update is “starting to roll out” globally as of today on both platforms.", "1:39 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF\n\nFiguring out the fastest way to get to your destination just got a lot easier. Google Maps has added car hailing to its list of transportation method options, which means you can order an Uber without leaving the app.\n\nNext time you have somewhere to go, don't bother opening the Uber app. As long as your apps are up-to-date and you're logged in to your Uber account, you should have the new ride-hailing option as soon as you open the Google Maps app.\n\nHow to order an Uber with Google Maps\n\nSearch for, or type in, your destination and map it out as usual. Once you see your route, swipe right on the transportation options on the top of the screen until you come across the stick figure holding a briefcase and select.\n\nThis will prompt a pop-up screen on the bottom showing price estimates and wait times for both Uber and Lyft. And though both show up as results, for now only Uber lets you complete the transaction without leaving the Maps app.\n\nClick on the Uber tab at the top. The interface is not exactly what you're used to seeing in the Uber app, but you still have the same basic options for comparing prices and wait times. Next, select your ride type (Pool, UberX, Uber XL, Select, Black or SUV) and click request.\n\nThis will prompt you to select a payment method. It defaults to the card on file for your Uber account, but you can easily add a different one or even use Android Pay if you have it set up on your phone.\n\nIf you've already linked Uber to your Google account, you should see the tiny car icon making its way to you as soon as you hit the \"Book it\" button on the bottom right. If not, you'll see a pop-up screen prompting you to do so before you book.\n\nOnce your driver is en route you can contact him or her directly from Google Maps or cancel your ride. You'll still be notified when the car arrives, and the actual ride is exactly the same.\n\nThe only thing you may still have to use the Uber app for is to rate your driver after the ride.\n\nAnd if you need more incentive to book via Google Maps, Uber is currently offering a $15 credit toward your first ride using Maps for both Android and iOS users. In the UK, the credit is £20", "Google has won a long-standing battle in Japan that drew parallels with Europe’s “right to be forgotten” ruling.\n\nThe Japanese Supreme Court today dismissed a case against the U.S. company seeking the removal of allegedly defamatory results from its search engine, including one case of a man who sought to remove details of his arrest on child prostitution charges, Japan Times reported.\n\nThe man took libel action against Google on the grounds of infringement of privacy, but the court decided that the result should remain online since it is a matter of public interest. The case didn’t take issue with articles of the arrest but, instead, that excerpts that could show in a Google search result.\n\nWhile there are similarities with Europe’s “right to be forgotten” ruling, the legal cases are not the same. The Europe’s case, the issues center around the freedom of individuals, but, in Japan, the suits against Google came a small number of plaintiffs that included both businesses and individuals.\n\n“We’re pleased that with these latest rulings, the Supreme Court has unanimously recognized, based on existing privacy and defamation laws, that any decision to delete information from search results should prioritize the public’s right to information,” Google told TechCrunch in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. firm previously argued against the removals, stating that they did not violate its terms and served an important purpose for the public.\n\n“While we provide tools that allow business owners to respond to reviews, and we take down posts that violate our policies, we believe online reviews, positive and negative, are a critical tool for people to give and read direct feedback about businesses,” it said in 2015.\n\nPost updated to correct details of the case", "Google's new app, Duo, is a simple video-calling service that's available for Android and iOS today. Alongside the upcoming messaging app Allo, it's one of two communication apps Google announced earlier this year at its I/O conference, and one of four altogether from the company.\n\nIn a way, it's Google's answer to Apple's FaceTime, and it makes one-to-one calling between Android phones, and from Android to iPhone, very simple. Though both parties have to download the app to begin chatting (unlike FaceTime, which is baked into the dialer of compatible iPhones), it's still an intuitive app to use.\n\nAnd while Android users will likely enjoy using Duo to video-call all their friends, iPhone owners won't find it compelling enough to ring up fellow iPhone users. However, it may certainly become their go-to app when calling up a buddy who uses Android. With that said, here are its main highlights:\n\nYou'll see previews with Knock Knock\n\nDuo's unique feature is Knock Knock, which gives you a preview of who is calling by firing up the camera on the other end of the line. If you're initiating the call, you'll see a little notice that says your video is visible, which means the other person can see what you're doing right at that moment in real time. Android users can see Knock Knock regardless of whether Duo is opened or not (like on the lock screen). On the iPhone though, you'll only see it if you're in the app. Otherwise, you'll just get a little notification saying someone's calling you.\n\nGoogle's rationale for this is that Knock Knock already gets you smiling before the call starts. Of course, that's assuming you actually like/want to speak to the other person who is on the other line. Seeing family members on the other line? That gets me smiling. Seeing the face of my boss? Mmm, not so much (see below). Editor's Note from said boss: \"Hmph.\"\n\nEnlarge Image Lynn La/CNET\n\nYou can disable Knock Knock\n\nBefore you worry about seeing anything you don't want to see from the other line, know that you can only receive Knock Knocks from people who are already in your contact list. You can also block individual people from calling you. (By the way, when you block a person on Duo, the person won't know it. When they call, they'll just hear your line ring and ring continuously.)\n\nIf Knock Knock really isn't your thing, you can disable it altogether in Duo's Settings menu. You can't disable Knock Knock on a person-to-person basis though, so it's Knock Knock or nothing.\n\nIts interface is super simple\n\nDuo has an incredibly user-friendly and intuitive interface. Before you begin a call, you'll see icons to start a video call and your recent contacts (sorry, there's no audio-only option). During a call, you'll see yourself (in a small little circle), and icons to mute audio, switch cameras and hang up. Video from the other line fills up your screen and that's pretty much it. If you'd rather have your camera fill up the screen (for example, you're touring a house to the person on the other line), just tap the preview circle and your view will switch. Read more about getting started with Duo.\n\nEnlarge Image Lynn La/CNET\n\nIt's different than Hangouts (no, really)\n\nAt this point you might be wondering what makes Duo different than Google's other video-calling service, Hangouts, and you're not alone if you think the company has one too many communication tools. But according to Google, Duo is supposed to be way more specialized. Whereas Hangouts can be used on desktops, supports messaging and group chats, and has multiway video for collaboration (and its interface reflects these extra features), Duo does one thing and one thing only: video calls on your phone or tablet.\n\nUnlike Hangouts, it reaches people through their phone numbers, not their Gmail. Other than downloading the app, you won't have to force anyone to log into their Google accounts or sign up for a new service. And the best difference between it and Hangouts? It uses end-to-end encryption, so your data can't be viewed from third parties or even Google itself.\n\nIt works only as well as your connection\n\nNot surprisingly, if you have a good Wi-Fi or data connection, the app works smoothly. When I used it and had strong coverage, people looked clear and their voices were easy to understand. I experienced some lag from time to time, but it usually lasted just a few seconds.\n\nWhen one of my colleagues was on a weaker Wi-Fi network, however, he was extremely pixelated. Though audio came in clear, his face just ended up looking like a study in 1880s pointillism. After he switched to a stronger Wi-Fi network, however, his image cleared up and our conversation was stable.\n\nGoogle\n\nYou might actually want to use it\n\nThere are loads of apps these days that either center around video chatting or have it as one of their features. Duo is coming into a crowded industry, competing not only against Skype, Facebook Messenger and others, but even Google itself with Hangouts.\n\nAll three of these competing apps do much more than simply one-to-one video calls. For example, they support messaging and you can start video calls with multiple people. Plus, with Messenger, you don't need a Facebook account (a phone number will suffice).\n\nBut Google didn't create Duo to be an all-in-one communication platform; to do so would make it hairier to use. Google also believes that when a person decides to video-call a friend, one rarely wants to pivot to messaging or group chatting anyway.\n\nBecause Duo offers just the bare bones, it can provide a solid, no-muss-no-fuss video calling service. This singular functionality frees you from having to sign in another account, make sure your buddy has the same service or take time to navigate through a busy interface. Plus, its end-to-end encryption means your conversations are protected from prying eyes. (As I mentioned before, Hangouts doesn't have that and Skype isn't secure either. Messenger has begun testing end-to-end user privacy, but hasn't rolled it out en masse.)\n\nTrue, iPhone users will probably keep using FaceTime to communicate with one another, but Duo bridges the gap between iOS and Android. With its quirky Knock Knock feature, simplistic approach and data encryption, Duo makes it a whole lot easier to say hi and wave hello.", "3:33 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF\n\nYou can soon ask your phones running Android Marshmallow and Nougat for help really soon.\n\nOnce exclusive to Google's Pixel phones, Google Assistant will soon be released to the wilds of Android 6.0 and 7.0 devices in the US as soon as this week, while users in Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK will get the feature soon as well.\n\nGoogle Assistant lets you talk to your phone in a conversational way, providing answers to questions about the weather, flight information and appointments. The assistant can even control your smart home, putting it head-to-head with Alexa. As tech giants continue to promote their own AI assistants such as Alexa, Siri and Cortana to get more users on board, Google's move to make Assistant on more phones will easily let the company secure a huge user base.\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nThere's no need to update your Android phone to receive the update -- Google says Assistant will be usable on phones with Google Play Services installed once available. The move to make Assistant available on more handsets follows an announcement earlier today with LG's new G6 phone sporting the feature.\n\nBesides smartphones, Assistant is already available on the Google Home smart speaker, Android Wear 2.0 devices, and will soon come to TVs and cars as well.", "Image copyright Raspberry Pi Foundation Image caption Raspberry Pi makers have tied up with Google previously\n\nGoogle is planning to bring artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to the Raspberry Pi.\n\nThe low-cost credit-card sized computer is widely used by schools and the maker community for programming devices.\n\nGoogle has asked makers to complete a survey about what smart tools would be \"most helpful\".\n\nAnd it suggests tools to aid face and emotion recognition, speech-to-text translation, natural language processing and sentiment analysis.\n\nGoogle has previously developed a range of tools for machine learning, internet of things devices, wearables, robotics and home automation.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi Foundation said the new tools could enable makers \"to build even more powerful projects\".\n\n\"Google is going to arrive in style in 2017.

That’s the primary motivation behind its move, announced this morning, to acquire Apigee, a company that went public last year, for $625 million.\n\nPut simply, Apigee builds software tools that let non-tech companies create the kind of tech they couldn’t on their own. If Burberry, an Apigee customer, wanted to use an app for retail or customer services, it would turn to Apigee.\n\nWith Apigee in tow, Google would have another point of entry to reach corporate clients, something it has made a big effort to do since hiring Diane Greene, its enterprise SVP, back in November. Initial reactions by sources in the industry applauded the deal as smart (and thrifty) for Google, although Google’s enterprise arm faces stiff competition from Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce.\n\nWe spoke briefly to Greene about the deal and how it fits into her nearly year-long effort to remake the search giant into a viable enterprise operation.\n\nThe interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. For a longer discussion with Greene, check out our upcoming Code Enterprise conference, where she is among the featured speakers.\n\nRecode: You could have bought a number of enterprise companies. Why this one?\n\nDiane Greene: This is a great one. As we spend more and more time with our enterprise customers — current ones, future ones, ones in the process — the API systems come up continually.\n\nSince I’ve started, I’ve had two [customers] ask what they thought of Apigee. The partners out there are saying that getting their API strategy functioning is a key step for their business.\n\nYou don’t have to wait on the phone. You just do it programmatically. It’s kind of an exploding area. As we provide the end-to-end solutions for what our customers want to do digitally, this is a big part of what they want to do in all kinds of verticals.\n\nWith app engines and containers, we’ve eliminated a lot of the code needed — sort of the back end of the back end. Now we can provide the front end of that back-end service.\n\nIs this acquisition more about deepening your ties with current customers or reaching new ones?\n\nCertainly [Google and Apigee] have overlap in our customers. We also complement each other. More than anything, it makes it so clear to the enterprise of how dedicated we are in a forward-looking way.\n\nIs the entire Apigee staff coming over? Will they work under your organization?\n\nWe can’t comment on that. We have to let [the deal] close.\n\nOkay. How do you see the deal fitting into what you’ve done since joining in November?\n\nWe just brought this organization together — the sales and marketing. Now we’re in a position where we can go talk to an enterprise with a single face. We can partner them with our engineers. Which they love, because they’re good engineers!\n\nThis just further complements and gives them all the components that they need and want. We’ve got a single team now. We’re all excited at the rate at which we’re developing functionality.\n\nGoogle made a serious investment in us. We’ve got a lot of work to do. But this is the biggest thing I’ve experienced.\n\nYou’ve invested heavily in machine learning and artificial intelligence to set the cloud operations apart. How does that fit in with the Apigee product?\n\nI don’t think we’re allowed to talk about what we can do yet.", "\n\nRemember Project Tango? Google's 3D-sensing smartphone project started development three years ago and first became public in 2014. The goal was to equip a smartphone with a depth sensor and other computer vision abilities. Why? To see what developers could come up with. It's a bit like strapping an Xbox Kinect to the back of a smartphone.\n\nNow, Tango is finally out in a consumer device, but this is not the triumphant launch of a new flagship product. After years of buildup, Tango is quietly debuting on a mid-range Lenovo phone, the Phab 2 Pro. The bloated, ugly hardware Lenovo created for the Phab 2 feels more like a barely designed developer kit than a slick consumer product.\n\nEven Google doesn't seem interested in the product. Contrary to most Google initiatives, Tango didn't get a Google-led launch event or press outreach. The most the company could muster was a blog post.\n\nArs still cares about Project Tango, though.

Just know that the Phab 2 Pro is a disaster. First of all, it's gigantic—the Phab 2 Pro is the Canyonero of smartphones. The combination of a 6.4-inch screen and huge bezels means this \"phone\" is 7 inches tall. It weighs over half a pound—double the weight of an iPhone 7—and it's so thick Lenovo doesn't list an official depth on its website.\n\nThe as-basic-as-possible rectangular design with minimally rounded corners contributes to the \"ridiculously big\" vibe the phone gives off. Compared to other really big phones like the Motorola Nexus 6 and the Xiaomi Mi Mix, the Phab 2 Pro feels like Lenovo didn't even try to make it look nice or compact. The Mi Mix is a great comparison since both phones have a 6.4-inch screen. Xiaomi tried to slim down and made a 158.8mm (6.25 inches) tall device, while Lenovo's design is a whopping 21mm (0.83 inches) taller.\n\nMuch of the Phab's girth is presumably to make room for the hefty 4050 mAh battery. Even that heifer can only run a Tango app for about an hour before draining to zero. Don't let the size of the battery fool you: the Phab 2 Pro is grossly underpowered. For some reason, the heavy 3D processing of Tango has been paired with a mid-range Snapdragon 652 processor. One of the coolest Tango apps, a 3D scanner, quickly bogs down to a few FPS thanks to the anemic processor. Tango, especially the scanner app, is a product that easily pushes the limits of top-of-the-line processors. The Snapdragon 652 doesn't stand a chance.\n\nThe Phab 2 Pro also feels old for an end-of-2016 device. I don't just mean the weight and massive bezels—the phone still has a Micro USB port on the bottom. The entire smartphone industry moved to USB Type C this year. Even low-end, sub-$200 devices are using the reversible plug. We're sure a decent amount of money went into the extra Tango sensors, but for $500 we expect an overall better package. The P2P's body is aluminum, at least.\n\nLenovo mostly stayed away from the software. Sure, there is a custom (and easily replaceable) home screen and custom app icons, but recent apps and the settings are intact. The one thing Lenovo touched was the notification panel (and by extension, the lock screen notifications). And wow, did Lenovo ruin it.\n\nNotifications that pull from Lenovo's custom UI don't have the usual solid white background. Instead, they're directly stuck onto a frosty transparent panel. This makes app notifications basically go crazy, with some picking white text, some picking black text, and some picking gray text. This chromatic free-for-all leads to all sorts of readability issues.\n\nThings are further complicated by how apps don't use the built-in notification style. Instead, they roll their own. That AccuWeather notification (which came with the phone) would look right at home on a device that follows Material Design, but it's a hot mess next to the rest of the notifications. I don't think this transparent design is against the Android compatibility docs, but it needs to be.\n\nHow Tango works\n\nOn the back of the device you'll find a tower of sensors. Some of them are just the usual smartphone parts, and some are the special sauce that makes Tango work. Let's start at the bottom: just above the fingerprint reader is a huge motion sensor camera that gives off a HAL 9000 vibe, and above that is a rear pinhole microphone. At the bottom of the top sensor cluster is a standard dual-tone LED flash, followed by the depth detection setup: an infrared emitter and a time-of-flight depth camera. At the very top is the regular 16MP RGB camera.\n\nWith the extra sensors, Tango can do three things for developers: motion tracking, area learning, and depth perception.\n\nMotion tracking allows the device to understand its motion as it moves through an area. This happens in full \"3D\" with six degrees of freedom. Not only can you tilt and spin, but you can walk around or kneel down and you'll still be tracked. Most developers use this mode to make the phone a \"portal to another world\" that works like a VR headset without any of the stereoscopic 3D or immersion. Motion tracking compares the images from the big fish-eye camera against movement data from the \"inertial measurement unit\" (a fancy combo of gyroscopes and accelerometers). The camera is used for \"feature tracking\"—visually identifying features like edges and corners as they move from frame to frame. Google's Tango stack can do this 100 times a second, if the hardware can keep up.\n\nallows the device to understand its motion as it moves through an area.

Google's Tango stack can do this 100 times a second, if the hardware can keep up. Depth perception allows Tango to see in 3D. Tango OEMs have a few options for doing this, but the Phab 2 Pro uses a Time of Flight (ToF) camera and an IR projector. The process works like LIDAR—tiny points of light are sent out of the IR projector and reflected into the ToF camera, which calculates the distance via the travel time. Depth perception apps can make a 3D point cloud of an area, which is neat in and of itself but also good for augmented reality apps that want to place something in 3D space.\n\nallows Tango to see in 3D.

Area learning combines motion tracking and depth perception to create a map of the area and identify your location within that map. Once a baseline scan has been completed, area learning works as a super-precise indoor GPS. You can stick a virtual object on a shelf, walk away from it, and it will stay there. Or—if someone ever creates an indoor map of something—area learning could work as an indoor navigation system. Tango saves these area scans in an Area Description File (ADF), which can be shared across apps.\n\nThat's basically it. Google provides this extra baseline of sensors and leaves figuring out what to do with them to the apps. Now that your phone can \"see in 3D,\" what can you do with it?\n\nMatterport Scenes, a 3D scanner app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatterport Scenes is easily the coolest Tango app, and it gives us an idea of how Tango sees the world. It makes a 3D point cloud of whatever you point it at and saves that image in a viewable, explorable 3D scene. An app like Matterport Scenes is impossible on any other smartphone.\n\nAll the Tango sensors go full blast with Matterport Scenes. The time-of-flight camera and IR projector constantly take 3D measurements of the world in front of them. They blast out points of light and measure how long they take to bounce back. This system doesn't see color, only depth, so the RGB camera is active, too. It applies some color to the 3D point cloud. You'll want to scan an object from multiple angles, so your movements are tracked by the fish-eye camera, which allows every new depth pass to be correctly applied to the growing point cloud.\n\nOnce you're done scanning, Matterport Scenes saves your 3D scans to an internal gallery that's easy to navigate. A one-finger drag rotates the view, pinch-zoom zooms, and a two-finger drag pans. The app also has nifty presets like \"3/4 overhead,\" \"First person,\" and \"Blueprint.\" You can measure your scans with a built-in ruler, there's a 3D crop tool, and the \"share\" button can send the full 3D data to another Matterport user. You can also snap a picture to send to everyone else.\n\nListing image by Ron Amadeo", "Uber has gained two former Google executives to work on the startup’s engineering team, the ride-hailing company has confirmed.\n\nFormer Google head of search Amit Singhal is joining Uber as SVP of engineering and former VP of engineering at Google Kevin Thompson will report to Singhal at Uber as VP of marketplace engineering.\n\nSinghal will work alongside CTO Thuan Pham and both will report directly to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. In his new role, Thompson will be managing things like driver dispatch and ride pricing.\n\nSinghal, the head engineer for the single most important product at Google, search, had been with the company for 15 years when he retired in February 2016. Thompson, who had been with Google for 12 years, officially resigned in November.\n\nAt the time Thompson resigned, he had been working on the engineering team of YouTube ads.\n\nAnother executive working in ads, former Google Americas president Margo Georgiadis, has also recently moved on from the company.

One — called Quick, Draw! — gives you a prompt to draw an image of a written word or phrase in under 20 seconds with your mouse cursor in such a way that a neural network can identify it. It’s both a hilarious and fascinating exercise with broader implications for how AI can self-learn over time in key AI research areas like image recognition and optical character recognition.\n\nQuick, Draw! is a great way to familiarize yourself with how neural networks work to identify objects and text in photos, which is one of the most common forms of AI-guided software techniques we see daily on platform’s like Facebook and Google Photos. As you start to craft the doodle, Quick, Draw!’s software automaton will start yelling out words and phrases it thinks you’re trying to illustrate. As you get closer to the finished product, the voice starts to become a good indication of how your drawing could be misinterpreted as something else. If you’re on point, however, the neural network will hone in on the object and guess correctly.\n\nIt’s fascinating because it shows just how difficult developing and training this type of technology is. When asked to draw a speedboat, I had to think critically about how a machine intelligence would reasonably differentiate between a sailboat and a speedboat. That meant my doodle couldn’t have a sail or be shaped like a half moon. It could, on the other hand, be relatively boxy and generic so long as the AI understood the object was supposed to be located on the surface of the water. In its post-doodle analysis, Quick, Draw! informed me that it thought my drawing could have been of a shark or a sea turtle. Over time, this neural network will learn from its mistakes and improve as more people play with it.\n\nIf you’re interested in checking out Quick, Draw! and other Google-powered AI experiments, head on over to the company’s new website. From there, you can choose between a number of new games and exercises created by programmers, artists, and even those without traditional AI and machine learning backgrounds.

The original suit is fundamentally about whether the common Silicon Valley practice of using open source technology created by other corporations constitutes a copyright violation, as Oracle’s lawyers have argued it does.\n\nElectronic Frontier Foundation Legal Director Corynne McSherry said in a statement, “It’s important for many technology developers, large and small. A finding of fair use here, while rooted in the facts of this case, could set important precedents for the use of APIs by everyone down the road — including Google.”", "Tech giant announces it is going ahead with delayed plans to build a campus for 7,000 employees with Olympic cauldron designer Heatherwick Studio on board\n\nGoogle has confirmed plans to build a new headquarters in London and create 3,000 jobs, in a move that will be seen as a vote of confidence in Britain’s prospects after Brexit.\n\nThe project, which involves building a vast headquarters next to Google’s existing base in King’s Cross, central London, was thrown into doubt by the EU referendum and disagreement about its design.\n\nBut Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said that while the firm has reservations about Brexit, it will not be dissuaded from building an office capable of housing 7,000 staff.\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday at Google’s London office, Pichai said: “Here in the UK, it’s clear to me that computer science has a great future with the talent, educational institutions, and passion for innovation we see all around us. We are committed to the UK and excited to continue our investment in our new King’s Cross campus.”\n\nPichai’s public approval dispels any lingering doubts about a plan, first tabled three years ago, that is slated to create 3,000 new jobs by 2020. But he did warn that the government’s expected crackdown on immigration after the vote to leave the EU runs counter to Google’s ideals.\n\n“In our experience as a company, when we have been able to bring people together and operate in an open and connected way it achieves tremendous impact over time,” he told the BBC. “Those are the values we cherish, and we have been open and public about how we think about these things.\n\n“Increasingly, for the kinds of complex things we do, we need to bring people who are across many disciplines – with many different backgrounds – together to solve problems,” he added. “That’s how you can build newer things, so that is particularly important for us.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An artist’s impression of the inside of Google’s new offices. Photograph: Google\n\nLondon’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, welcomed the announcement, and argued that it put paid to fears that Brexit would damage the capital’s position as the leading European technology hub. “This is a vote of confidence in our great city – creating high-skilled jobs, supporting growth and demonstrating that London is open to business, new investment and talent from around the globe.\n\n“London is one of the world’s leading technology hubs and investment into the capital post-Brexit remains robust, so Google’s expansion will further strengthen our city’s reputation as a global leader in digital technology.”\n\nIn a nod to Canada, whose immigration website collapsed after the election of Donald Trump, Khan said: “London is open, and our website is not going to crash.” As to whether London will benefit more directly from Trump’s election, he said it depended on how close the prime minister and the president-elect end up being.\n\n\n\nThe chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the confirmation of the Google development was a “big vote of confidence in Britain’s leading position as a global tech-hub and more evidence that leading firms are choosing to invest here”.\n\nThe new building, which will be Google’s UK headquarters, was reportedly thrown into turmoil in 2015 when bosses in California rejected the original plans, by London-based architects AHMM, for being “too boring”, and brought in Thomas Heatherwick, the designer of the new London bus, the Olympic cauldron and the garden bridge.\n\nThe 10-storey “landscraper” will be as long as the Shard is tall, and have a floorspace of 650,000 sq ft (60,400 sq metres). The original plans were for a £1bn building with a climbing wall, rooftop pool and indoor football pitch.\n\n\n\nThe new building will lie alongside the railway station, in an area currently used by King’s Cross theatre for shows including The Railway Children, In The Heights, and the David Bowie musical Lazarus.\n\nGoogle will continue to occupy its current building, a 380,000 sq ft office at nearby 6 Pancras Square which has room for 2,500 employees. Construction on a second building that Google will occupy but not own began earlier this year, with Google’s move due in 2018.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, the new headquarters will be designed and owned by Google, a first outside the US. But it could prove problematic for the company if its tax affairs in the UK are not cleared up in the meantime.\n\nIn January this year, Google agreed to pay a £130m settlement to HMRC, but continued to insist that its presence in Britain is minimal, and doesn’t constitute a “permanent establishment”. Instead, under the company’s internal structure, the majority of income from British customers is technically spent in Ireland, where Google’s advertising sales department is based.\n\nWith the growth of Google’s DeepMind subsidiary, a pure research AI firm founded in London and currently based in the King’s Cross offices, as well as the company’s decision to own and design the headquarters, those claims could be subject to reassessment, if the firm does not choose to change its affairs first.\n\nPichai told the BBC: “As a company, we want to be a good citizen in every market we are in and that is true for the UK as well … but I think it is important to remember that we are one company in a global system and it is more important for governments and citizens to sort out the right structure and we are always happy to engage in a thoughtful and constructive manner.”\n\nHeatherwick’s design agency, Heatherwick Studio, has had mixed success in recent years. Its new bus for London was welcomed as a design icon by the then mayor, Boris Johnson, but was criticised by passengers for ineffective air cooling and by environmental campaigners for being less fuel efficient than the buses it replaced.\n\nHeatherwick Studio is working with Danish architects Bjarke Ingels Group on the project. In a joint statement they said that the goal with the new building was to “create an interestingness that fits the scale and the community of King’s Cross. The Silicon Valley startup garage meets the London train sheds in a building that couples clarity with eccentricity and anchors innovation with heritage.”", "Google’s investment in virtual reality pales beside Facebook’s $2 billion purchase of the VR pioneer Oculus.

Underwood was exhibited last year at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery.\n\nJeff Koons, whose art works have sold at auction for as much as $58 million, had early access, though he was not part of the artists in residence program. Bob Mankoff, Roz Chast and other cartoonists for The New Yorker have also checked it out, as has Alex Hirsch, the young animator behind Disney’s hit television series “Gravity Falls.” Last June, Mr. Hirsch posted a sample creation on Twitter along with an enthusiastic status update: “Drawing in virtual reality makes you feel like a world-devouring wizard god!”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the first to try it was Glen Keane, a near-legendary figure who in his 37 years at Disney had brought the warmth of hand-drawn animation to such characters as Ariel (in “The Little Mermaid”), Aladdin, Tarzan and Pocahontas.\n\n“When I left Disney in 2012,” Mr. Keane said recently in his studio, a vintage bungalow on a quiet residential street in West Hollywood, Calif., “I told them it was because I know there’s something new coming — I don’t know what it is, but I need to leave to find it.”\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe was still looking when he met Regina Dugan, then the leader of Google’s secretive Advanced Technology and Products group, which was experimenting with virtual reality. First he partnered with the group to make a hand-drawn virtual reality short called “Duet,” a charming piece released in 2014 about two babies growing up that was shortlisted for an Academy Award. “Duet” broke new ground, since animation in virtual reality had almost exclusively been computer-generated. But though he’d spent a lifetime drawing on paper, Mr. Keane had always dreamed of being able to make the paper disappear. “The goal would be to animate not on paper but in space,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEnter Tilt Brush, which Mr. Keane encountered when Mr. Skillman introduced himself at a visual effects conference in San Francisco. Though still in a primitive state, it was maturing rapidly, and Mr. Keane soon became a convert. In September 2015, seven months before its release, he previewed its capabilities with “Step Into the Page,” a five-minute video. “The edges of the paper are no longer there,” he exclaimed in a voice-over as he did a loose, freehand sketch of Ariel in virtual space. “This is not a flat drawing. This is sculptural drawing.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nScott McCloud, the graphic artist whose book “Understanding Comics” is considered the ultimate guide to the art form, got to play with Tilt Brush when Google invited him to its Silicon Valley headquarters in August. “I don’t mind saying, I’m a little bit obsessed with this program,” he said as we sat in his small, book-crammed office in a mall in the Los Angeles exurb of Thousand Oaks. “One thing that appeals to me the most is, it’s still very early. Everyone is asking fundamental questions. We’re still trying to figure out what people are going to use it for. I love it when technology is in that stage.”\n\nPhoto\n\nSo, what are people going to use it for? Mr. McCloud threw out a few suggestions: performance art, virtual sculpture, industrial prototyping. “I doodle with it,” said Mr. Yeo, the painter, who spoke by telephone from London. “I describe it as a three-dimensional sketchbook.” What it won’t produce is anything resembling comics as they currently exist in the medium some call “Flatland.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor denizens of Flatland who have learned to work within the constraints of 2-D, this can be problematic. Mr. Mankoff, the cartoon editor at The New Yorker, came up with some characteristically Mankoff-like 3-D drawings during the two days he spent using Tilt Brush with Ms. Chast and other colleagues at Google’s New York offices. But though he professes to have enjoyed the experience, he seems unlikely to lead The New Yorker out of Flatland. “You’ll probably find a sharp divide between older and younger cartoonists,” he said. “Or it may just not work — but that’s no reason not to try it.” One suggestion the New Yorker team had: cubes and cylinders and other ready-made shapes to draw on, “so you’re not starting from zero in 3-D space.” (Google has since implemented a similar idea.) Other than that, Mr. Mankoff offered with a grin: “The advice I would have for Google is, more cats. You can’t go wrong with cats.”\n\nMr. Keane has a different item on his wish list. Currently, works created in Tilt Brush are as motionless as a New Yorker cartoon. They’re essentially static, and Mr. Keane is an animator. “To me, the thing to conquer is to be able to animate in real time in space,” he said as I viewed a Tilt Brush drawing called “Victory Dance” in his studio. The piece captures a brief moment in time, seconds after his daughter’s high school choir had won a national championship — but it begs to be brought to life.\n\n“Just like you have a spatial dimension, you’ve got to have time as a dimension,” Mr. Keane continued. “There’s no reason you can’t do that. I’m not smart enough to figure it out. But Drew is.”", "Image copyright Project Loon\n\nResearchers at Google say they are “years closer” to rolling out a network of huge balloons to provide connectivity to rural areas.\n\nThe Project Loon team, part of the company’s X research lab, said it was now able to use machine learning to predict weather systems.\n\nIt means the firm has far greater control over where its balloons go, making it possible to focus on a specific region, rather than circumnavigating the globe.\n\nClustering a small number of balloons greatly reduces the cost of the idea, Google’s “captain of moonshots”, Astro Teller, told reporters.\n\n\"We can now run an experiment and try to give service in a particular place in the world with ten, twenty or thirty balloons,” he said, rather than the hundreds needed previously.\n\n“Real users” will be able to use the system in the “coming months”, he added - but he did not specify where the initial roll out would take place.\n\nRural ambition\n\nGoogle’s aim is to provide connectivity to the around four billion people in the world who do not have access to the internet, particularly those in difficult-to-reach rural areas.\n\nRather than undertake huge construction projects to replicate connectivity networks in the developed world, the firm has instead experimented with beaming down connectivity from a network of huge, tennis-court sized balloons.\n\nThe balloons float in the stratosphere around 11 miles high. By raising or lowering altitude, the balloons can be caught in different weather streams, changing direction.\n\nBy using machine-learning algorithms, Google thinks it has cracked a way to predict weather with enough accuracy to make it possible to hover balloons over a relatively small area for a long period of time.\n\nLast last year the firm was able to keep a cluster of balloons over Peru for three months.\n\nSpin off\n\nOver the past year Google has come under increasing pressure from its shareholders to rein in the costs of its more outlandish ideas.\n\nLast month, the firm has spun off its self-driving project into a new company - Waymo - and has stepped up attempts to commercialise the technology amid criticism it was taking too long to make money from its work.\n\nMr Teller said Project Loon was one of the more “mature” moonshot ideas at the company, but while it was entering into contracts with telecoms firms, Google was in “no rush” to make Project Loon a stand-alone business.\n\n“The service has a much better chance of being profitable which is obviously exciting for us,” he said.\n\n\"Things have gone much better than we anticipated they could go. That has made the prospects of Loon even better than we had anticipated.”\n\nFalling out of the sky\n\nOne key hurdle for the company to overcome is the reliability of its balloons. To date, the record for continuous balloon flight has been 190 days.\n\nAt a research lab within Google’s campus in Mountain View, California, development teams painstakingly analyse each failed balloons on a huge scanner nicknamed “Billie Jean” owning to light panels reminiscent of the illuminating pavement in Michael Jackson’s iconic music video.\n\nOther technologies trying to achieve similar goals have been tested by Google and others. The company recently shut down Project Titan, an effort to use solar-powered drones to deliver connectivity to a wide area. The programme was cancelled owing to economic and technology difficulties, the company said.\n\nFacebook has attempted to work with similar technology. Its Project Aquila drone, which is being developed in the UK, suffered a major setback when one of its craft crashed last June.\n\nOn the challenge facing Project Loon, Mr Teller admitted that many at the company did not think it would ever actually work.\n\n“If we’d known how hard it was going to be, we probably never would have tried,” he wrote in a blog post published on Thursday.\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook", "When text messaging was simple, SMS worked beautifully. You could send 160 characters to anyone with a cellphone, and they’d receive it the same way they would a phone call. In the age of flip phones and nine-key texting, that was all anyone needed. But when texting gave way to group messaging, video calls, and (Sent with Fireworks), the SMS standard just couldn’t keep up anymore.\n\nOver the last couple of years, Google has been working with hundreds of carriers and manufacturers around the world to bring the text message into the 21st century. Using a standard called Rich Communications Services, the group plans to make a texting app that comes with your phone and is every bit as powerful as those dedicated messaging apps. This would make all the best features available to everyone with an Android phone.\n\nOh, and the plan’s working. New carriers have been slowly announcing RCS support over the last few months. Sprint, Rogers, Telenor, and other global giants all bought in. Now Deutsche Telekom, Globe, and Orange are on board, as is Vodafone on a limited basis. In all more than a billion subscribers now have access to RCS messaging tools. If you’re building a messaging app, those are pretty good user numbers.\n\nReturn to Sender\n\nThis adoption is a long, long time coming. The ideas behind RCS date back as far as 2007. That’s when a group at the GSMA, the trade group representing 800 or so carriers around the world, began to think about the future of messaging. It imagined a new service, carried the same way cell data is, that would enable voice calls, video and photo sharing, group chat, and more. There would be no signing up, no usernames—it would be as simple and ubiquitous as texting. GSMA CTO Alex Sinclair wrote in 2008 that RCS “will enable mobile users to see at a glance whether their contacts are available to talk or exchange instant messages, easily initiate chat sessions with a group of friends or exchange pictures or videos during a voice call, regardless of which device or network they are using.”\n\nIn retrospect, the GSMA’s proposal was dead right. But the standard almost immediately devolved into a complicated morass of spin-offs, politicking, and branding confusion.\n\n“It’s infected with bureaucracy, complexity, and irrelevance,” industry analyst Dean Bubley wrote in 2015. He called RCS a zombie: dead, but somehow still ambling around. “I meet virtually nobody in the industry who thinks that RCS anything other than a joke,” he wrote, “apart from a couple of tired-looking vendor representatives.”\n\nGoogle sees it differently. For the company with seemingly thousands of messaging platforms, each one with different features and different audiences, RCS presents an opportunity. It could help Android compete with WhatsApp and Facebook, as well as with Apple’s iMessage. iMessage is so appealing because it’s so simple: you just send a message, the same way and in the same app for everyone. It either sends with stickers and balloons to another iPhone user, or gracefully reverts to a simple text message for everyone else. The only difference is the bubble color. iMessage is one of the best (and hardest to leave) features of iOS, a reason lots of people pick iPhone in the first place. Google can’t simply build the same thing and force its success: if it goes to carriers and demand they use Allo, they’ll just say no. Since manufacturers can customize Android to their liking, Google has to woo them one by one as well.\n\nFortunately, Android’s marketshare is so large, particularly in developing countries, that anything supported across all Android devices would effectively be universal. If Google can convince everyone to play along, RCS offers all the new-fangled features users want, with a fallback to SMS for those who can’t use it. It could be effortless and foolproof. Just like iMessage. Just like texting.\n\nSweet Talk\n\nGoogle bought Jibe, a startup focused on this exact issue, in 2015. Jibe’s up-until-then CEO Amir Sarhangi was promptly placed in charge of making RCS happen. The team worked with a new implementation of the GSMA standard called Universal Profile, powered it with Google tech and integrated it into the Messenger app. Then they started talking to carriers about integrating the new tech. Ordinarily, Sarhangi says, a carrier has three or more different vendors dedicated to making messaging work. “We walk in and say, ‘Mr. Carrier, we just need a couple of integration points with you around authentication, and then it’s a matter of working with the product and marketing teams to get ready for the launch.'” Convincing carriers to work with them is much harder than actually implementing anything.\n\nMany carriers see messaging as one of the three pillars of service they provide, along with voice and data. They also see it as a place they can differentiate. Sarhangi and his team’s challenge has been convincing those carriers and manufacturers that messaging is not a place to try something new and funky and exclusive. Everyone could roll out their own GSMA-approved version of RCS, but that would likely lead to stagnation and fragmentation the way SMS did. Google believes everyone has to use the same version of RCS for it to work. “No single carrier can make this be a big hit,” Sarhangi says. “Even if one carrier is completely devoted to it and launches it, they can’t move the industry.”\n\nApp Factor\n\nThe Messenger app is the key to the whole equation, since it’s where users will actually engage with all these new features along with the old SMS and MMS messages. It’s no longer called Messenger, by the way—it’s now Android Messages. It’s very important to Google that this app is seen as an Android thing, not a Google-specific thing. Google’s working with mobile manufacturers around the world to pre-install Messages on all their phones rather than let those companies build their own texting apps. Google also recently put Messages in the Play Store, so it can be updated without waiting for huge Android updates that often never come to existing phones. “On older devices, we will continue to upgrade the experience to give people new experiences,” Sarhangi says. Plus, this puts the onus for improvement on Google, rather than the carriers. Which is probably good news.\n\nGoogle is a hugely powerful player in the mobile world, but it can’t just snap its fingers and change things.\n\nStill, for once it feels like Google’s on the right path in messaging. More than 8 trillion SMS messages are sent every year, despite the tech’s antiquity. Texting won’t die until something comes along that’s radically better and just as painlessly universal. If Google, the carriers, and the manufacturers can pull that off, messaging could be easy again. And this time, we won’t have to remember how to type on numerical keypads.", "This spring, Google plans to discontinue Google Site Search, a product it has sold to web publishers that wanted to apply the industry's leading search technology to their own sites.\n\nGoogle ( googl ) disclosed its plans to customers and partners via email on Tuesday, but the news has not been announced publicly. The product has been around since 2008.\n\nExisting customers can keep using GSS for the life of their current license, but Google will stop selling new licenses and renewals as of April 1, according the email viewed by Fortune . Once a customer's allocation of search queries is exhausted, the account will \"automatically convert\" to the company's Custom Search Engine, or CSE for short.\n\nA Google spokesman noted via email that the company is \"winding down the Google Site Search product over the next year, but will provide customer and technical support through the duration of license agreements.\"\n\nHe added that for GSS users whose contracts expire between April 1 and June 30, 2017, Google will provide a free three-month extension to their service with an additional queries.\n\nCSE is a free, advertising-supported version of Google's search technology, that provides similar features and functions to GSS, according to the email.\n\nGoogle recommended that GSS customers study the differences between the two products and that those who do not want to move to CSE can remove their existing search engine .\n\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter.\n\nGoogle charged GSS customers based on the number of searches made annually. A small blog, for example, would get 20,000 searches per year for $100. A larger company might opt for 500,000 queries for $2,000 annually. Companies that wanted higher volumes of searches had to contact Google for pricing.\n\nThe news of GSS's discontinuation comes just over a year after Google announced similar plans to phase out Google Search Appliance, which bundled Google search into a piece of hardware that ran in companies' own data centers.\n\nFor more on Google, watch:\n\n\"It appears that Google is decoupling its technology that is ad-based from its enterprise technology which is G Suite based,\" said one GSS customer who requested anonymity because he did not want to irk Google.\n\nG Suite, is a popular set of desktop word processing, spreadsheet, and email applications that competes with Microsoft ( msft ) Office.\n\nWhile G Suite's predecessor, Google Apps was once a free product, users now must pay for G Suite.\n\nFebruary 21, 2017 (4:00 p.m.) This story was updated to add a comment from Google.", "Method #2: Install the Google Play Store\n\nInstalling the full Google Play Store is the best way to get Android apps on your Kindle tablet over the long term. You don’t have to download them one at a time, and anytime you need to install one, you can just open the store and grab it. You’ll also get Google Play Services, which means more apps will work with it. However, this method is also more complicated, and you’ll need to be comfortable with the command line.\n\nYou should also try to do this as early as possible if you have a new Fire tablet. Amazon automatically applies system updates when you’re not using your tablet, and this method may not work with newer versions of Fire OS. Fortunately, RootJunky’s tool can block future updates, but it’s best to get started with a fresh device running 5.3.1 or earlier if possible. Mine worked on version 5.3.2.1, but future updates may break this tool. If you already have a tablet or if it’s already updated, give it a shot, but you might encounter some bugs.\n\nTo get started, you’ll need to enable developer options. Here’s how:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the Home screen, scroll down and tap the Settings app. Tap Device Options. Tap Serial Number seven times. A pop-up notification should say “You are now a developer!” A new menu option named Developer Options should appear beneath Serial Number. Tap it. Tap the toggle that reads “Enable ADB.”\n\nFor the next part, you’ll need to have ADB installed on a Windows PC. Find the RootJunky SuperTool you downloaded earlier (if you’re running 5.3.1 or later get it here, for older versions get it here) , then follow these steps:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConnect your Fire tablet to your PC with a micro USB cable. Extract the contents of the SuperTool .zip file to their own folder. Launch the batch file named 1-Install-Play-Store in the SuperTool folder. When the program finishes loading, you’ll see a menu like the one above. Type 1 for “ADB driver install” and press Enter. Here, you can confirm whether ADB is working. Type 2 for “ADB driver test” and press Enter to test your ADB connection. If the app says the test failed, type 1 for “ADB driver install” to install the necessary drivers on your PC to connect ADB with your Fire tablet. Once you’re finished, you will be returned to the main menu. Type 2 for “Install Google Play store and remove ads from lock screen.” After the installation is finished, you should be back at the main menu. (Optional) Type 3 for “block OTA updates from Amazon.” This will prevent an automatic update from breaking your apps. Once you’re finished, restart your device immediately.\n\nYou should now see the Play Store listed in your apps section. The first time you install an app that uses Google Play Services, you’ll get a notification to download that as well. Once that’s finished, you can download any app from the store just like it’s a normal Android device.\n\nHowever, you may notice a few bugs. In my testing, I found that Gmail and Google Maps worked fine, but Inbox crashed as soon as I opened it. Also, even though I was logged into my Google account, the Play Store didn’t recognize some paid apps I already bought. Your experience may differ depending on which device you use and which version of Fire OS you’re running.\n\nThe Kindle Fire tablets are powerful little devices that are dirt cheap. Even if you bought yours just to read books, the Play Store will unlock a lot of potential you never knew was there. Enjoy your new, more powerful tablet.\n\n", "As promised earlier this year, Google is bringing RCS – Rich Communications Service, an upgrade to the SMS standard – to Android devices. Its first carrier partner on the initiative is Sprint, which is rolling out RCS messaging to its customers with Android devices, starting today. Once enabled, RCS will offer Android users an enhanced messaging experience over SMS, with features like better group chats, high-resolution photo sharing, read receipts and typing indicators.\n\nGoogle announced its plans to move in this direction when it acquired RCS provider Jibe Mobile back in September 2015. The Jibe cloud platform will power the new service on Sprint, says Google.\n\nSprint subscribers will have their standard SMS experience upgraded through Google’s redesigned Messenger app on their Android devices, provided they are on Android KitKat or higher, and have set Messenger as their default SMS application.\n\nThose using select LG and Nexus phones from Sprint will be automatically upgraded to RCS through an app update, while others can manually update their devices by downloading the Messenger app from the Play Store.\n\nGoogle’s new Pixel-branded smartphones come with Messenger pre-loaded, so if a customer is using an unlocked device on the Sprint network and has Messenger installed, it will also have access to RCS.\n\nBeginning next year, all new Android devices from Sprint will come with Messenger preloaded as the default SMS and RCS messaging app, says Google.\n\nFor consumers who gain access to the new messaging experience on Sprint Android phones, they’ll be able to take advantage of features that rival Apple’s iMessage or other third-party messaging apps. For example, though MMS today supports group messaging, you can’t do some of the things people now expect – like naming the group, adding new members, or leaving an existing group. That will change with RCS.\n\nIn addition, Sprint users will be able to share 100x larger images and videos than was possible with MMS, will know if messages are delivered or read, and will see typing indicators when someone is writing to you.\n\nRCS, as a technology, has been around since 2007, but it has only been launched by 49 carriers worldwide, according to the GSMA. However, the organization says that Sprint is the first to launch the new RCS profile initiative – the other launches involved older iterations on the standard.\n\nThis is also the first time Google itself has rolled out RCS support anywhere in the world. (The now Google-owned Jibe platform, of course, had previously supported older versions of RCS, however.)\n\nWhile positioned to some extent as a way Google can compete with iMessage, the problem with RCS is that it’s not universally adopted. Unlike with iMessage, which works with any Apple device, RCS is made available by carriers, and it won’t work on older Android smartphones. In other words, the impact of this launch – for now, at least – is limited.\n\nGoogle says it has plans to launch RCS with other carrier partners in the “coming months,” but won’t speak to which ones, or when.\n\nIn the meantime, the move seems to muddle Google’s messaging ambitions even further. After all, where is Google placing its bets these days?\n\nTo take advantage of RCS, Android users on supported devices have to use Google’s Messenger app as their default client. But, at the same time, Google continues to offer its Hangouts chat and calling app, and it’s promoting its new Allo app as the future of messaging, thanks to its integrated A.I. assistant. Allo also comes pre-installed on Google’s new Pixel smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL. (Hangouts can be set as the default SMS app, Allo cannot).\n\nAllo does work cross-platform – as does Duo, its video counterpart – but they are both rather late entries into larger messaging market, where third-party apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and others now dominate.\n\nAnd, in terms of competing with iMessage, Google simply doesn’t have the same infrastructure in play.\n\nBy owning the entire platform – from hardware to software – Apple is able to lock users into its own iMessage ecosystem on any Apple device. And now, it’s even running a new App Store on top of that platform.\n\nGoogle may be able to convince more carriers to roll out RCS in the future, but that will take time. And the technology won’t be as front-and-center as iMessage is in Apple’s world, as users on supported devices have to upgrade their apps, switch their default settings, and/or upgrade from older Android phones to use it. In the meantime, fragmentation will continue among RCS and non-RCS Android devices, not to mention Google’s own growing number of alternative messaging apps it can’t seem to stop creating.", "iStock / ryccio\n\nGoogle has previously taught its artificial intelligence to play games, and it's even capable of creating its own encryption. Now, its language translation tool has used machine learning to create a 'language' all of its own.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn September, the search giant turned on its Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) system to help it automatically improve how it translates languages. The machine learning system analyses and makes sense of languages by looking at entire sentences – rather than individual phrases or words.\n\nFollowing several months of testing, the researchers behind the AI have seen it be able to blindly translate languages even if it's never studied one of the languages involved in the translation. \"An example of this would be translations between Korean and Japanese where Korean⇄Japanese examples were not shown to the system,\" the Mike Schuster, from Google Brain wrote in a blogpost.\n\nREAD NEXT Beauty.AI's 'robot beauty contest' is back – and this time it promises not to be racist Beauty.AI's 'robot beauty contest' is back – and this time it promises not to be racist\n\nThe team said the system was able to make \"reasonable\" translations of the languages it had not been taught to translate. In one instance, a research paper published alongside the blog, says the AI was taught Portuguese→English and English→Spanish. It was then able to make translations between Portuguese→Spanish.\n\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of true multilingual zero-shot translation,\" the paper explains. To make the system more accurate, the computer scientists then added additional data to the system about the languages.\n\nHowever, the most remarkable feat of the research paper isn't that an AI can learn to translate languages without being shown examples of them first; it was the fact it used this skill to create its own 'language'. \"Visual interpretation of the results shows that these models learn a form of interlingua representation for the multilingual model between all involved language pairs,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD NEXT Briefcam's algorithms can spot murderers and monitor bees Briefcam's algorithms can spot murderers and monitor bees\n\nAn interlingua is a type of artificial language, which is used to fulfil a purpose. In this case, the interlingua was used within the AI to explain how unseen material could be translated.\n\n\"Using a 3-dimensional representation of internal network data, we were able to take a peek into the system as it translated a set of sentences between all possible pairs of the Japanese, Korean, and English languages,\" the team's blogpost continued. The data within the network allowed the team to interpret that the neural network was \"encoding something\" about the semantics of a sentence rather than comparing phrase-to-phrase translations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We interpret this as a sign of existence of an interlingua in the network,\" the team said. As a result of the work, the Multilingual Google Neural Machine Translation is now being used across all of Google Translate and the firm said multilingual systems are involved in the translation of 10 of the 16 newest language pairs.\n\nThe research from the Google Brain team follows its recent work that taught AI to create a form of encryption. In a research paper published online, the scientists created three neural networks: Alice, Bob, and Eve. Each of the networks was given its own job. One to create encryption, one to receive it and decode a message, and the final to attempt to decrypt the message without having encryption keys.\n\nAfter training, the AIs were able to convert plain text messages into encrypted messages, using its own form of encryption and then decode the messages.", "Google has altered autocomplete suggestions in its search engine after it was alerted to antisemitic, sexist and racists entries.\n\n\n\nGoogle’s autocomplete feature aims to suggest common searches after a user enters one or more words into the site’s search box or address bar of its Chrome browser.\n\nTyping the phrase “are Jews” into Google, the search engine suggested “evil”, for “are women” it again suggested “evil” and for “are Muslims” it suggested “bad”, an Observer article reported.\n\nGoogle, democracy and the truth about internet search Read more\n\nOn Monday the searches for Jews and women no longer returned those results, although the “are Muslims bad” autocomplete was still present.\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “We took action within hours of being notified on Friday of the autocomplete results.” Google did not comment on its decision to alter some but not all those raised in the article.\n\nIt said: “Our search results are a reflection of the content across the web. This means that sometimes unpleasant portrayals of sensitive subject matter online can affect what search results appear for a given query. These results don’t reflect Google’s own opinions or beliefs – as a company, we strongly value a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures.\n\n“Autocomplete predictions are algorithmically generated based on users’ search activity and interests. Users search for such a wide range of material on the web – 15% of searches we see every day are new. Because of this, terms that appear in autocomplete may be unexpected or unpleasant. We do our best to prevent offensive terms, like porn and hate speech, from appearing, but we acknowledge that autocomplete isn’t an exact science and we’re always working to improve our algorithms.”\n\nThis is not the first time Google and others’ autocomplete and search algorithms have caused offence. An auto-suggested photo tag within Google’s Photos service in July 2015 labelled two black teenagers as “Gorillas”. Google apologised and said it was working on “longer term fixes” around the recognition of dark-skinned faces as well as the linguistics of photo labels.\n\n\n\nIn May 2015, Google apologised when the White House was returned as a result for searches for “nigger house” and “nigger king” within Google maps.\n\nGoogle declined to explain why the results occurred but a spokesperson said: “Some inappropriate results are surfacing in Google Maps that should not be, and we apologise for any offence this may have caused.”\n\nIn April this year Google apologised after a search for “unprofessional hairstyles for work” yielded image results showing predominantly black women with natural hair, while searching for “professional” ones returned pictures of coiffed, white women.\n\nIn June, Google’s image search also caused offence by returning criminal mugshots for searches of “three black teenagers” but not for “three white teenagers”.\n\nGoogle has also previously denied “conspiracy theories” accusing it of censoring its search results to please the Conservative party in exchange for a deal over its taxes.", "1:09 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF\n\nThe Gooligan malware attack targeting Android devices has infected more than a million Google accounts and growing by 13,000 new users a day.

Google Assistant wasn’t just going to be a Siri competitor. It was going to be the next step towards a Her-like future, only with fewer dystopian notes and more magic. Google Assistant wouldn’t just learn your habits, it would be intuitive to use to the point that it could become seamlessly part of your life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle Assistant certainly understands the simple questions, and as evidenced in the video above, it often returns results for those questions much faster than Siri. Need the time of day or to find out where the hell you are? Google Assistant returns the answer about two to three times faster than Siri.\n\nAnd Google Assistant learns diligently. Siri can pick up a personal preference or two—I trained the assistant to call me Master of the Universe, for example. Yet what it can learn and how it can learn it feels absurdly limited next to Google Assistant. I asked both assistants how the Cowboys were doing and then asked who my favorite team was. Siri was confused by the follow up question, but Google Assistant immediately understood and asked if I wanted to make it remember I love the Cowboys forever. I said yes. It remembered. It seemed magic was in the air.\n\nBut that’s where the wow factor of Google Assistant ended. It’s fast, and it can learn, but it fails at understanding complex questions, and that’s a dealbreaker. Most users aren’t versed in computer logic. They’re my mom who accidentally activates Siri every time she plays Mahjong, or my friends who chat Siri up after a night of drinking.\n\nSponsored\n\nPeople want to converse with their digital assistants. They want a relationship, as narrow and limited as it might be. A digital assistant that can’t understand questions as simple as “I need a doctor” or “where can I get some cookies” is not a good digital assistant. Google Assistant only understood “I need a doctor” 50 percent of the time I asked, while “where can I get some cookies” returned a bad YouTube video 100 percent of the time. And it didn’t want to engage in gentler conversation either.\n\nSiri is sweetly sassy when you ask it if it loves you or tease it with a reference to Google Assistant. Google Assistant is coldly robotic. “I do not understand the question” is its favorite response. And for a digital assistant that was supposed to change the world and how we communicate with our devices, that’s a really dumb answer.", "From a group of 16 contestants, five teams are officially moving forward into the final stretch of the Google Lunar X Prize competition — an international contest to send the first private spacecraft to the surface of the Moon. To win the competition, one of these finalists has to be the first to launch a spacecraft to the Moon by December 31st, 2017, and then explore the lunar surface.\n\nThe groups spread from the US West Coast to Japan\n\nThe five teams moving ahead are SpaceIL, Moon Express, Synergy Moon, Team Indus, and Hakuto, according to an announcement by the X Prize Foundation today. The groups are based in various countries across the globe, spread from the US West Coast to Japan. In order to advance to this stage of the competition, each team had to secure a verified launch contract before the end of 2016. That entailed booking a rocket to launch the team’s spacecraft in 2017 and then having that launch contract verified by the X Prize Foundation.\n\nThe first group to get one of these verified contracts was the Israel-based team SpaceIL. In October 2015, SpaceIL announced that its lunar lander, named Sparrow, would ride to space as a secondary payload on one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets by the second half of 2017. The next to secure a contract was Moon Express based out of California, which has a long-term ambition of mining the Moon for resources. The company announced in December 2015 that its MX-1E lander would launch on top of a smaller, experimental rocket called the Electron, manufactured by aerospace startup Rocket Lab. The Electron has yet to fly for the first time, but test launches are supposed to happen sometime in early 2017. Moon Express has also received approval from the US government to fly its mission.\n\nThe remaining three teams secured launch contracts in the second half of 2016. Synergy Moon, an international team made up of members from more than 15 different countries, announced in August that it would be launching its lunar lander and rover on top of a Neptune 8 rocket. That vehicle is being manufactured by Interorbital Systems, but like the Electron, the rocket has yet to fly to space.\n\nTeam Indus and Hakuto have decided to share a ride to space\n\nAs for the India-based Team Indus and Japan-based team Hakuto, the two have decided to share a ride to space. Team Indus booked a ride for its lunar lander and rover on a PSLV rocket — a proven vehicle developed by India’s space agency, the Indian Space Research Organization. However, it turned out that Team Indus had room to spare on its spacecraft, so the group struck a deal with Hakuto. Team Indus’ lander will now carry the Japanese team’s rover to the Moon as well.\n\nToday’s announcement means that a few other hopefuls are no longer officially in the race. One team based out of Germany called Part-Time Scientists was seemingly close to advancing to the next round, too. The group announced at the end of November that it had signed a contract with Spaceflight Industries, a company that helps find rockets for spacecraft launchings. The deal was for PT Scientists’ rover to launch as a secondary payload on a yet unidentified rocket, according to Space News, but it seems that the contract was not officially verified by X Prize before last year’s deadline.\n\nEstablished in 2007, the Google Lunar X Prize is just one of many global contests created by the X Prize Foundation aimed at addressing specific needs for society. Other competitions have focused on mitigating the effects of climate change or improving health care, but the ultimate goal of the Google Lunar X Prize is to come up with ways of lowering the cost of spaceflight. That’s why the teams in the competition have been challenged with privately funding their missions; each group cannot get more than 10 percent of its funding from government sources.\n\nThe teams also have to meet certain mission requirements in order to take home the grand prize. Not only do the spacecraft need to land on the Moon intact, but the vehicles also need to travel at least 500 meters on the lunar surface. To fulfill that requirement, most teams have built rovers, while SpaceIL and Moon Express have taken a different approach by designing landers that “hop” across the Moon. Additionally, all the spacecraft must send back photos from the lunar surface, and provide live video “Mooncasts.”\n\nTo win any of the competition’s prizes, a team must initiate its mission to the Moon by December 31st, 2017\n\nNow that the final teams have been verified, time is quickly running out to accomplish all of these tasks. Teams must launch their missions to the Moon by December 31st 2017, in order to win any of the competition’s prizes. Originally, X Prize required the teams to have completed their Moon missions before December 31st in order to win, but X Prize recently updated the restriction “in recognition of the diverse mission plans of each finalist team.” The first team to fulfill all of the requirements will receive the grand prize of $20 million, while the second to do so will receive $5 million. Other cash prizes will be given for pulling off special tasks, such as visiting an Apollo landing site.\n\nHowever, all 16 teams, including the ones that didn’t advance to the next round, will be receiving a money prize, too. X Prize announced today that groups would all be splitting a $1 million “Diversity Prize” as a reward for their “unique approaches” to spaceflight and all the educational outreach that the teams have done leading up to the final stage of the competition. “Each of these teams has pushed the boundaries to demonstrate that you don’t have to be a government superpower to send a mission to the Moon, while inspiring audiences to pursue the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics,” Chanda Gonzales-Mowrer, senior director of the Google Lunar X Prize, said in a statement.\n\nA look at SpaceX's Mars colonization plans", "For the longest time, Google Sites felt like the forgotten app in Google’s productivity suite. Earlier this year, though, the company announced that it would finally give Sites a full overhaul. Today, after a short beta, this new version of Sites is going live for all users.\n\nGoogle Sites is essentially a drag-and-drop website builder for creating both public facing web pages and intranet sites that’s deeply integrated with the rest of Google’s tools. You can easily insert documents from Google Docs, Slides, Sheets and the rest of the (unfortunately named) G Suite tools into any site, for example. It also directly integrates with Google Analytics. The new sites now also allows multiple users to collaboratively edit a site (using the same tech the company also uses in Google Docs).\n\nAdmins can choose whether users are able to publish to the web or only able to make their pages available to users on their own domain.\n\nWith this update, any pages you create in Sites will also automatically scale according to the screen size you are using — and its preview mode makes it easy to see what a site will look like on a phone, tablet and desktop. In order to make those sites look halfway professional, Google added six new themes to get you started. All of these themes come with customizable font and color settings, but I hope Google will add a few more options over time.\n\nSadly, it doesn’t look like you’ll be able to easily move existing sites over to the new experience (which made our Editorial Director here at TechCrunch rather unhappy), but at least for the time being, you’ll be able to jump back and forth between the old and new editors. Update: A Google spokesperson told us that Google will provide and recommend options for migrating from the classic Sites to the new Sites in 2017.\n\nMost importantly, though, Sites is now a product people will want to use. It finally feels like a modern applications and not like the last vestige of Google’s old and forgotten design principles.", "As the development of artificial intelligence continues at breakneck speed, questions about whether we understand what we are getting ourselves into persist. One fear is that increasingly intelligent robots will take all our jobs. Another fear is that we will create a world where a superintelligence will one day decide that it has no need for humans. This fear is well-explored in popular culture, through books and films like the Terminator series.\n\nAnother possibility is maybe the one that makes the most sense - since humans are the ones creating them, the machines and machine intelligences are likely to behave just like humans. For better or worse. DeepMind, Google’s cutting-edge AI company, has shown just that.\n\nThe accomplishments of the DeepMind program so far include learning from its memory, mimicking human voices, writing music, and beating the best Go player in the world.\n\nRecently, the DeepMind team ran a series of tests to investigate how the AI would respond when faced with certain social dilemmas. In particular, they wanted to find out whether the AI is more likely to cooperate or compete.\n\nOne of the tests involved 40 million instances of playing the computer game Gathering, during which DeepMind showed how far it’s willing to go to get what it wants. The game was chosen because it encapsulates aspects of the classic “Prisoner’s Dilemma” from game theory.\n\nPitting AI-controlled characters (called “agents”) against each other, DeepMind had them compete to gather the most virtual apples. Once the amount of available apples got low, the AI agents started to display \"highly aggressive\" tactics, employing laser beams to knock each other out. They would also steal the opponent’s apples.\n\nHere’s how one of those games played out:\n\nThe DeepMind AI agents are in blue and red. The apples are green, while the laser beams are yellow.\n\nThe DeepMind team described their test in a blog post this way:\n\n“We let the agents play this game many thousands of times and let them learn how to behave rationally using deep multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather naturally, when there are enough apples in the environment, the agents learn to peacefully coexist and collect as many apples as they can. However, as the number of apples is reduced, the agents learn that it may be better for them to tag the other agent to give themselves time on their own to collect the scarce apples.”\n\nInterestingly, what appears to have happened is that the AI systems began to develop some forms of human behavior.\n\n“This model... shows that some aspects of human-like behaviour emerge as a product of the environment and learning. Less aggressive policies emerge from learning in relatively abundant environments with less possibility for costly action. The greed motivation reflects the temptation to take out a rival and collect all the apples oneself,” said Joel Z. Leibo from the DeepMind team to Wired.\n\nBesides the fruit gathering, the AI was also tested via a Wolfpack hunting game. In it, two AI characters in the form of wolves chased a third AI agent - the prey. Here the researchers wanted to see if the AI characters would choose to cooperate to get the prey because they were rewarded for appearing near the prey together when it was being captured.\n\n\"The idea is that the prey is dangerous - a lone wolf can overcome it, but is at risk of losing the carcass to scavengers. However, when the two wolves capture the prey together, they can better protect the carcass from scavengers, and hence receive a higher reward,” wrote the researchers in their paper.\n\nIndeed, the incentivized cooperation strategy won out in this instance, with the AI choosing to work together.\n\nThis is how that test panned out:\n\nThe wolves are red, chasing the blue dot (prey), while avoiding grey obstacles.\n\nIf you are thinking “Skynet is here”, perhaps the silver lining is that the second test shows how AI’s self-interest can include cooperation rather than the all-out competitiveness of the first test. Unless, of course, its cooperation to hunt down humans.\n\nHere's a chart showing the results of the game tests that shows a clear increase in aggression during \"Gathering\":\n\nMovies aside, the researchers are working to figure out how AI can eventually “control complex multi-agent systems such as the economy, traffic systems, or the ecological health of our planet – all of which depend on our continued cooperation”.\n\nOne nearby AI implementation where this could be relevant - self-driving cars which will have to choose safest routes, while keeping the objectives of all the parties involved under consideration.\n\nThe warning from the tests is that if the objectives are not balanced out in the programming, the AI might act selfishly, probably not for everyone’s benefit.\n\nWhat’s next for the DeepMind team? Joel Leibo wants the AI to go deeper into the motivations behind decision-making:", "Image: Dropbox\n\nHey Google—there’s a new lightweight, web-based, word processing tool in town and it’s called Dropbox Paper. After more than a year of beta testing, the app is finally available to anyone with a Dropbox account. It might not be loaded with as many features as Google Docs, but there’s still plenty to love that sets it apart from the more staid cloud-based word processor. Here are some of the reasons you might want to make the switch from writing all your missives in the Google ecosystem.\n\n\n\n1) More freedom for your docs\n\nImage: Screenshot\n\nTechnically speaking, Paper is an online word processor, but it’s more like Evernote or OneNote in the way it handles content. Your documents can really flow from text to check boxes to images to code snippets, and there’s no real restriction on the way you can stack elements together. As an added bonus, most of the layouts are handled automatically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight from the start, when you open a new document, you’re encouraged to just dive in and start typing—and Google Docs feels like a Word-inspired throwback by comparison, even if it does have some handy layout features of its own. Animated GIFs and emojis are supported in a clean and simple way too, should your documents need a bit of variety.\n\n2) The interface is ultra lightweight\n\nImage: Screenshot\n\nO nce upon a time Google Docs, Sheets and Slides had a lightweight interface—but inevitably more and more features got pegged on and nowadays waiting for your files or the app interface to load can take up an unnecessary amount of time. Google Docs is by no means a mammoth resource hog, but it could certainly stand to shed a few pounds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaper, on the other hand, is about as stripped down as you can get. A lot of the menus and options don’t appear until you’ve selected something (like an image or a block of text) and when you’re in the default view all you get is your document and a small menu bar. There aren’t any settings or options to speak of, which for us is another plus point for Paper.\n\n3) You can embed almost anything\n\nGIF Image: Dropbox\n\nTry throwing anything you like at Paper—a SoundCloud clip, a YouTube link, an image from disk, a tweet—and the app neatly embeds your media without breaking a sweat. It’s refreshing to see an online app act as cleverly as this when it comes to recognizing what you’re copying and pasting into documents besides all the standard text and images.\n\nAll of this embedded media can be played and interacted with right within Paper too, so you’re not always hopping in and out of whatever document you’re working on. As you would expect, linking to files inside your Dropbox is super simple and takes just a second, and you can even link to Google Docs files as well, if you have stuff stored there.\n\n4) The sharing options are smarter\n\nImage: Screenshot\n\nGoogle Drive is admittedly great for sharing files and collaborating on documents as a team, but Dropbox Paper might be even better—again, it’s the simple and intuitive way that the app works that gives it the edge. Paper takes a similar approach to tagging as Facebook or Twitter, and you can tag someone in a document whether they use Dropbox or not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSponsored\n\nDocuments can be shared individually or added to a folder with group access, and you can choose to invite people to edit (or view) a file via email or with a specific URL. Importantly, all the sharing and commenting tools pop up exactly where you would expect them—you get the impression Paper was built with collaboration in mind right from the beginning.\n\n5) It’s not run by Google\n\nImage: Google\n\nWe won’t wade too deep into the topic of data privacy here, but it’s fair to say that Google is keen on collecting a lot of information about you in return for providing all the free stuff it offers. If that kind of overreaching data slurping is a turn off when you’re choosing your web services, then Dropbox Paper offers an alternative that’s not run from Mountain View.\n\nSure, Dropbox collects data on its users too, but it’s not reading your emails or tracking your favorite spots on a map or logging your web searches—it knows far less about you than Google potentially does. If you’ve decided to go Google-free or just want to cut down on the number of Google services you use, then you’ve got another reason to use Paper.", "If you got an Amazon Echo or Google Home voice assistant, welcome to a life of luxurious convenience. You’ll be asking for the weather, the news, and your favorite songs without having to poke around on your phone. You’ll be turning off lights and requesting videos from bed. The world is yours.\n\nBut you know what? That little talking cylinder is always listening to you. And not just listening, but recording and saving many of the things you say. Should you freak out? Not if you’re comfortable with Google and Amazon logging your normal web activity, which they’ve done for years. Hell, many other sites have also done it for years. Echo and Home simply continue the trend of saving a crumb trail of queries, except with snippets of your voice.\n\nHowever, it’s still a reasonable concern for anyone worried about privacy. If you only use Chrome in “Incognito Mode,” put tape over your laptop camera, and worry about snoops sniffing your packets, a web-connected microphone in your home seems risky. It’s a fair thing to be unsettled about. But recording your voice is a major part of how voice assistants work. Here’s how devices like Echo and Home record your voice, why they do it, what they do with the data, and how to scrub those recordings.\n\nHow In-Home Voice Assistants Work\n\nWhenever you make a voice request, Google Home and Alexa-enabled devices record or stream audio clips of what you say. Those files are sent to a server—the real brains of the operation—to process the audio and formulate a response. The recorded clips are associated to your user account, and that process is enabled by default.\n\nBecause their brains are located miles away, Echo and Home need an internet connection to work. They do have a very rudimentary education, though: The only spoken commands they understand on their own are “wake words” or “activation phrases,” things like “Alexa” or “OK Google.” Once you say those magic words, the voice assistants jump to life, capture your voice request, and sling it to their disembodied cloud brains over Wi-Fi.\n\nThat means their mics are listening to you even when you’re not requesting things from Alexa or Google. But those ambient conversations—the things you say before “Alexa” or “OK Google”—aren’t stored or sent over a network.\n\nWhy Do They Need to Eavesdrop?\n\nListening to what you say before a wake word is essential to the entire concept of wake words. The process borrows a page from the pre-buffer on many cameras’ burst modes, which capture a few frames before you press the shutter button. This just does it with your voice.\n\nWith a camera, the pre-buffer ensures you don’t miss a shot due to a slow shutter finger. In the case of voice assistants, audio pre-recording helps systems handle requests instantly. Without a perked ear for that “Alexa,” “OK Google,” or “Siri,” these assistants would need activation buttons.\n\nIn fact, if you’re really freaked out by the concept of something always listening to you in your home, your best bet is a push-button voice assistant. Things like the Amazon Tap, the Alexa remote for Fire TV, or your phone with its “always listening” mode turned off.\n\nIs This Secure? Can Hackers Tap In and Listen To Me?\n\nNothing is impossible, but Amazon and Google both have security measures that prevent snoops from wiretapping your home. The audio zipping from your home to Amazon and Google’s data centers is encrypted, so even if your home network is compromised, it’s unlikely that the gadgets can be used as listening devices. A bigger risk is someone getting hold of your Amazon or Google password and seeing a log of your interactions online.\n\nThere are also simple measures you can take to prevent Echo and Home from listening to you when you don’t want them to. Each device has a physical mute button, which cuts off the mic completely.\n\nWhat About Siri?\n\nSiri records your queries too, but she doesn’t catalog them or provide access to the running list of requests. You can’t listen to your history of Siri interactions in Apple’s app universe.\n\nWhile Apple logs and stores Siri queries, they’re tied to a random string of numbers for each user instead of an Apple ID or email address. Apple deletes the association between those queries and those numerical codes after six months. Your Amazon and Google histories, on the other hand, stay there until you decide to delete them.\n\nWell, How About Cortana?\n\nMicrosoft’s Cortana voice assistant on Windows 10 works a bit differently, but it still mirrors some of your personal information on servers. To customize your experience, Cortana uses a combination of cloud-stored data and on-device data.\n\nTo see and manage the data stored on your machine, jump into the Start Menu, select Cortana, and click the rectangle with a circle inside it in the left sidebar. From there, you can view and delete entries in Cortana’s “Notebook,” a running list of all the information Microsoft’s voice helper knows about you. That Notebook and your cloud-stored info is synced, and you can check your Bing personalization hub to see what’s stored on Redmond’s servers.\n\nYour Cortana-management controls are really granular, so it’s best to follow Microsoft’s deeper tutorial on how to manage your personal info.\n\nWhat Happens To Your Recorded Audio Clips?\n\nIf you feel like revisiting past queries, you can listen to short clips of yourself asking to translate “shoehorn” into Italian or whether you should wear galoshes today. Alexa users can find a running list of their queries in the Alexa app in Settings > History. If a user has several Alexa devices in their arsenal, each one has its own listenable queue of requests.\n\nGoogle users can find everything they’ve asked for by visiting myactivity.google.com while they’re logged into their account. This query museum doesn’t just include voice requests. It also includes any Google searches, YouTube videos, and apps you’ve launched on Android, among other things. It’s all presented in a neat, searchable chronological stack.\n\nThere are user benefits to these personal audio catalogs. For cases where spoken-word answers aren’t very useful—recipes and search results, for example—Amazon and Google provide links to written content in the Alexa and Home apps. Both companies say these audio databases help each system serve up personalized content and learn the intricacies of your Maine accent.\n\nThe semi-good news is that you have a bit of control over whether audio clips are saved or recorded at all. There are two big caveats, though. Disabling recording is only an option in Google Home, and when you do it, the device basically doesn’t work. And while you can delete your log of audio clips for both Alexa and Google Home, it’s unclear whether the data survives on servers after you delete it from the queue in your account.\n\nUpdate: But what about the bigger pool of data, the aggregated voice queries from each system’s user base? According to this Bloomberg story, Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft are using all that variety to hone these systems’ understanding of spoken language even further. Several times a day, Amazon uses the entire stack of Alexa queries to educate its A.I. about dialects and casual speech. Microsoft has mysterious fake apartments(!) set up to record and understand natural speech patterns. Google slices and dices the audio it’s already captured, then remixes it to help train its system. All these methods are meant to make your voice assistant smarter in the coming years.\n\nHow to Stop and Delete Voice Recordings in Google Home\n\nThere’s a hardware and a software way to silence Home’s microphone. The easy hardware method is to just tap the “Mute” button on the back of the device. Of course, the Assistant won’t record (or hear) your voice queries while mute is enabled. Just hit the mute button again to have Home start listening again—and recording and sending audio snippets again, too.\n\nHow about if you want Google Home to work without recording you, like an “Incognito Mode” for voice search? Unfortunately, there’s no way to do that right now. You can disable voice recording and audio logging at myactivity.google.com, but there’s a whale of a catch: Doing so makes Google Home a temporary paperweight.\n\nAt least it’s a paperweight that talks to you. Whenever you say “OK Google” and ask for anything, the speaker says “Actually, there are some basic settings that need your permission first.” And of course, it’s referring to turning voice-recording right back on again.\n\nIf you want to pause it anyway, visit myactivity.google.com, tap the three vertical dots on the top left of the page, select “Activity Controls,” and slide the “Voice & Audio Activity” slider to the left to pause it. Keep in mind that this doesn’t just disable Google Home, it also deactivates the Assistant on Android phones.\n\nWhile you’re stuck with recording and logging audio snippets, you can delete saved audio clips after the fact. To do that, go to myactivity.google.com, tap the three vertical dots in the “My Activity” title bar, and select “Delete activity by” in the drop-down menu. Click the “All Products” drop-down menu, choose “Voice & Audio,” and click delete. Google says this may affect some of Google Home’s personalization features, because it essentially wipes its memory.\n\nHow to Stop and Delete Voice Recordings in Alexa\n\nAmazon’s Alexa app doesn’t let you stop recordings altogether, but just like Google Home, there’s a mute button on its Echo devices for temporary privacy. Amazon’s push-to-talk products, such as Tap and the Alexa-enabled remote for Fire TV, still record your requests. However, you have to manually engage a button to make Alexa listen, so you have direct control over when the devices are listening to you.\n\nYou can delete your long list of recordings in the Alexa app, but the app only lets you do that one entry at a time. To do a bulk-delete, you’ll need to visit amazon.com/myx, click the “Your Devices” tab, select your Alexa device, and click “Manage voice recordings.” A pop-up message should appear, and clicking “Delete” will wipe out your saved clips.", "Chrome browser is fast and capable but it can murder your battery life. Here’s how to help your laptop or tablet last longer\n\nGoogle’s Chrome browser is used by over 62% of the world’s PC users, but it’s a notorious battery hog that if left to run rampant can reduce your laptop or tablet to just a couple of hours of life. But it doesn’t have to be like that, as Google is making efforts to improve it. In the meantime, here are some tips to get Chrome’s battery usage under control without sacrificing functionality.\n\n1) Update your Chrome\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Keep Chrome up to date for the latest in battery, speed and efficiency improvements, as well as security and feature updates. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian\n\nThis one might sound like a no-brainer, but you’d be surprised how many people do not update Chrome. Google’s recent versions of Chrome have become much more efficient and faster.\n\nTo check your version of Chrome is up to date, type “chrome://help/” into the address bar and hit enter. It shows a version number and a link to check for and install updates or a notice saying that Google Chrome is up to date. Updating shouldn’t take long and you can continue to use Chrome until it has been downloaded. Then Chrome will reboot, but you won’t have to restart your computer.\n\n2) Suspend those tabs\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Great Suspender will unload the tabs you don’t need right that minute without losing the URL. Photograph: The Great Suspender\n\nOne of the best bits of the modern browser is the ability to have multiple tabs. One or two is OK, but when you end up with 20 or so sitting idle in your browser your battery pays the price.\n\nGetting rid of tabs is a good start, but if you don’t want to change your usage, suspending tabs can be even better.\n\nThe Great Suspender is the tool you need. If you don’t use a tab for a few minutes, the Great Suspender will unload it, removing its workload on your computer but keeping the tab there ready to go again when you need it. All you have to do is click into the tab to reload it and continue where you left off.\n\nIt won’t suspend anything with active input, such as text chats or similar, while you can temporarily whitelist tabs, or permanently whitelist a whole domain so that your Guardian articles never get unloaded, for instance.\n\nOther tab suspender tools are also available on the Chrome store, should the Great Suspender not fit the bill, including those that can suspend a group of tabs and restore them as one complete session.\n\n3) Remove unnecessary extensions\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Remove those extensions you don’t need. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian\n\nExtensions are part of what makes Chrome great, but each extension added to Chrome can increase its load on your computer, slowing it down and eating more battery life.\n\nSimply disabling or removing them entirely from Chrome, particularly big or feature-packed ones such as those that allow the use of tools offline can dramatically reduce Chromes impact on your PC.\n\nType “chrome://extensions/” into the address bar and hit enter. Then all you have to do is click the box to either disable them, or the bin icon to remove them entirely. Try disabling them first, and if it doesn’t break anything you use regularly, then trash it. You can always add them back from the Chrome web store if you find you miss them.\n\n4) Stop Chrome running in the background\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stop Chrome and Chrome apps running in the background. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian\n\nEven once you’ve closed Chrome you might find it sticks around, consuming power unnecessarily. That’s because Chrome can run, often hidden in your system tray on Windows or your Dock on MacOS in support of web apps. Google’s Hangouts chat app, for instance, needs Chrome to run all the time to work. But in doing so it’s eating your laptop’s battery and hogging your computer’s resources.\n\nTo stop it from happening on Windows, find the Chrome icon in your system tray on the right-hand side of the screen (usually hidden under the little arrow). Right click on it, and uncheck “Let Chrome run in the background”. An alternative same setting can be found under advanced settings:\n\nType “chrome://settings/” into the address bar. Hit enter. Click the “Show advanced settings” link to expand the menu, scroll to the bottom and uncheck “Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed”.\n\nTo then run all the web apps your might have installed, such as Hangouts or Signal, you’ll have to keep Chrome open. But at least when you close Chrome it really will shut off.\n\n5) Disable Google Drive offline access\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Disable Google Drive offline access if you don’t use it. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian\n\nAnother tool Chrome uses for web apps that could be draining your battery life unnecessarily are background pages. They’re loaded in the background, as you might assume, and sit there ready for the web app. Signal’s Chrome app uses one, for instance, but one that is relatively heavy that you may or may not use or know you have enabled is Google Drive offline access for Docs, Sheets, Slides and Drawings.\n\nIt’s only useful for those documents you’ve stored offline and need to edit offline. For everything else it’s just a waste of computer resources.\n\nTo turn it off head to drive.google.com, click the settings cog in the right-hand corner and uncheck the box for Offline. It can always be re-enabled should you find you do need it at a later date.\n\n6) Block Flash and make plugins click-to-play\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Block Flash from running. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian\n\nIn general browsing, many of the most demanding and therefore battery-draining elements on a page require a plugin, such as Adobe’s much maligned Flash, to run. By being selective about the plugins that run on a page you can make some of the worst offenders have less of an impact on your computer.\n\nYou can manually disable individual plugins, but the easiest way to save battery with plugins is to make them request to run each time. Then you can click and run the ones you want on the page – say for the video you want to see – without letting any of the others run unnecessarily.\n\nType “chrome://settings/” into the address bar. Hit enter. Click the “Show advanced settings” link to expand the menu and click the box marked “Content settings ... ” under Privacy.\n\nOn the latest version of Chrome scroll to “Unsandboxed plug-in access” and make sure the box marked “Ask when a site wants to use a plug-in to access your computer” is checked. It’s also worth checking the box marked “Block sites from running Flash” under Flash, although you may use some sites and services that still require Flash – you can add these as exceptions.", "Credit: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg\n\nMost Popular\n\nGoogle is going to let advertisers target YouTube ads based on people's search histories, giving brands a whole new perspective into the consumer mindset.\n\nOn Friday, Google announced updates to its YouTube offering for advertisers, including a promise of new measurement tools to help marketers understand their campaigns. But it was the introduction of search data into the targeting of YouTube video spots that most intrigued advertisers.\n\nBrands could start to consider pushing video ads to YouTube viewers who recently searched for a retail product, travel destination or movie show time.\n\n\"There has been targeting on YouTube based on what videos people watch there,\" said one top advertising exec, speaking on condition of anonymity because of a close relationship with Google. \"Now, for anyone logged in, their search history can be applied to targeting on YouTube. There's some interesting possibilities there, and it greatly expands the audience advertisers could reach.\"\n\nGoogle's search data is considered among the most powerful information for guiding advertising, but Google has kept it under tight wraps, careful when applying it toward ads outside the search experience.\n\nGoogle faces extra scrutiny from regulators and privacy advocates when it comes to collecting consumer data and applying it to its ad products.\n\nFor years, the company kept a wall between search and other ad products, but increased competition from Facebook has made that commitment impractical.\n\nGoogle declined to comment for this story, but did post a blog statement on Friday.\n\nGoogle users can turn off ads personalization in their settings.\n\n\"As more viewership on YouTube shifts to mobile, we're making it easier for advertisers to deliver more relevant, useful ads across screens,\" Diya Jolly, YouTube's director of product management, said in the blog post. \"Now, information from activity associated with users' Google accounts (such as demographic information and past searches) may be used to influence the ads those users see on YouTube.\"\n\nMs. Jolly described how someone searching for a winter coat could then see an ad in YouTube from a retailer.\n\nGoogle said that more than 50% of YouTube video is viewed on mobile devices.\n\nGoogle also revealed that it was working on a \"cloud-based measurement solution\" over the next year, to give advertisers more information into how their campaigns perform but balancing that with consumer privacy.\n\nThe measurement development appears to be a nod to the advertising uproar over the past few months, in which brands have begun to question the accuracy of the numbers coming out of the platforms like YouTube and Facebook.\n\n\"With this new solution, advertisers will have access to more detailed insights from their YouTube campaigns across devices, so they can better understand the impact of their campaigns on their highest-value customers,\" Ms. Jolly's blog post said. \"For instance, a car manufacturer could get a rich understanding of how YouTube ads across devices influenced a specific audience (like previous SUV buyers).\"\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Diya Jolly, YouTube's director of product management, as \"Mr.\" on second reference instead of \"Ms.\"", "Collectively known as the FANG stocks, Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are among the tech titans of our time.\n\nFacebook and Google alone capture the lion's share of all global online advertising, including in the fast-growing mobile format, while Amazon dominates e-commerce and cloud services with its Amazon Web Services business.\n\nSpecial Report: IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards\n\nAnd although Netflix is facing increasing competition from Hulu and fellow FANG stocks — particularly Amazon and YouTube owner Google — its original programming and massive global expansion in 2016 have cemented its leadership in the streaming industry.\n\nCheck this page regularly for ongoing coverage of the latest FANG news and investing insight.\n\nRELATED:\n\nApple Stock Quotes & News\n\nTesla Stock Quotes & News\n\nMore Tech Stock News\n\nBest Stocks To Buy And Watch", "Sony’s latest 4K panels boast powerful processors that improve the look of just about any video you throw onto the screen. But the chips inside these TVs don’t stop at making movies look better: Like giant Pixel phones, the TVs will have Google’s voice-controlled Assistant built into them.\n\nWell, they will eventually. According to Sony, Google Assistant will be added to their new sets via a firmware update later this year.\n\nThe sooner they can do it, the better. Tens of millions of people are expected to decide it’s finally time to buy a 4K TV this year, and the deals are delicious at every point of the pricing spectrum. Variety abounds too, as the industry’s big brands try to solve different pieces of the picture-quality puzzle. Samsung is preaching the power of quantum dots, Vizio is all about value, and LG is team OLED. While Sony finally has an OLED of its own, the company believes its competitive advantage comes from two places: Having a TV with the best image processing, and having a TV with a great voice platform.\n\nOK Google, Change the Channel\n\nSony’s sets already come with Android TV, but this year’s models will be the first television sets with Google Assistant on board. The sets won’t always be listening for that “OK Google” cue: You need to hit a button on the included remote for Assistant to register your queries, but you can also use a Google Home speaker to communicate with the TV without hitting a button.\n\nIf you’re familiar with the way Assistant looks and sounds on a phone, a demo looked similar on Sony’s big screens. You hit a button on the remote, ask it things, and Assistant’s bubbly little bar appears on the bottom of the display. You’ll be able to ask it general queries and control other devices in the Google Home universe, but the built-in Assistant will have a few TV-specific features. For example, you can change source inputs just by asking, launch apps on the TV, start playing a show just by asking for it, and adjust the volume and channel. Google Home can already interact with any TV with Chromecast capability built in, so you if you have one of those sets, you can order it around by barking at Google’s smart speaker. But this level of integration on the Sony sets is much deeper.\n\nTrust the Processor\n\nSony’s top-of-the-line X1 Extreme processor remains in its flagship Z9D television, and it’ll be in the upcoming Bravia A1E OLED. One of the key features is an “object-oriented” approach to improving the contrast and color attributes of different items in a video. Instead of applying broad strokes to each frame, the processor analyzes different elements within it. It can apply different levels of noise reduction to different objects in the frame, eliminate artifacts to achieve pure black, and apply smooth color gradation within objects in a scene.\n\nNow, Sony is putting the X1 Extreme into more of its TVs. It’s also adding more-powerful processors to its lower-end sets, purportedly making the lower-priced panels perform better than their hardware specs would indicate.\n\nThe new X800E, X850E, and X900E TVs will have lower-end X1 processors that provide similar object-oriented HDR processing and contrast-enhancing features. The higher-end X930E and X940E, which both play Dolby Vision HDR video, will have that top-of-the-line X1 Extreme processor. The X940E is a full-array LCD set with local-dimming technology to boost contrast and justify its higher price. But the litmus test of what Sony’s most powerful processing engine can do is the X930E, which is an edge-lit LCD panel the company says can perform like a full-array TV with local dimming.\n\nA traditional edge-lit LCD TV uses a backlight systems that isn’t directly behind the LCD panel. This design makes them thinner, but also makes it harder for an edge-lit LCD TV to control contrast, and it makes the lighting appear uneven across the whole screen. The X930E is an edge-lit set, but due to its processing engine, Sony claims it performs just as well as a full-array backlight system with local dimming—the most sought-after combo in LCD tech.\n\nAll that remains to be seen, but the X930E has a promising legacy. Its predecessor, the X930D, earned high marks from several reviewers, and Sony claims the contrast levels on the newer set are noticeably better than last year’s.\n\nIdeally, these powerful processors would mean cheaper panels with better performance, but that’s not the case just yet. Sony intends these smarter sets to go up against the OLEDs and QLEDs of the world, and they’ll be priced accordingly when they ship next month. The 65-inch X930E will run you $4,000, the 55-inch model costs $3,300, and the lowest-end X800E—a way-too-small 43 inches—starts at $1,000. OK Google, when are prices going to drop?", "For at least several months before Alphabet splintered off its car division and named it Waymo, the company had made it clear that it did not want to build a car. Instead, Waymo’s strategy was to work on developing the brains of the emerging self-driving industry’s cars instead.\n\nThey were building the driver, executives had said time and time again. Today, that may mean one of Waymo’s new ambitions is to provide the complete technological platform to the automakers making self-driving vehicles.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear when the plan shifted, but the new tack easily jibes with Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat’s directive to meet specific financial targets for the company’s sometimes wayward experiments, known as moonshots. It’s not as sexy as building a car, but it’s a quicker way to realize revenue from a new industry.\n\nBuilding parts isn’t as sexy as building a car, but it’s a quicker way to realize revenue from a new industry.\n\nThe first indication that Waymo was positioning itself as a competitor to players like Mobieleye and Delphi came in December, when CEO John Krafcik announced the company was going to build its own sensor technology, the proverbial eyes that self-driving vehicles need to track the road and any obstacles such as oncoming traffic or pedestrians.\n\nBut the real key is that the hardware would be far cheaper than what was currently available. Specifically, Krafcik said the company found a way to bring down the cost of a crucial technology that it once sourced from third-party suppliers: The laser-based radar.\n\nWhen the company first built its own self-driving prototype it cost $75,000. A combination of altering the design and bringing the production in-house allowed the company to bring that cost down 90 percent, according to Krafcik.\n\nAt the time, Krafcik said selling its hardware to automakers was a possibility.\n\n“Having our hardware and software development under one roof is incredibly valuable,” Krafcik said during his keynote at the AutoMobili-D conference in Detroit. “Our sensors are developed in close collaboration with our software experts who specialize in AI techniques like machine learning. A single integrated system means that all the different parts of our self-driving technology work together seamlessly.”\n\nWaymo’s relationship with automakers will likely be different than that of a traditional supplier. One version of that relationship is its partnership with Fiat Chrysler, for which the two companies collaborate on building the vehicle but they are owned and operated by Waymo.\n\nSuppliers, on the other hand, simply deliver its hardware or software to automakers which then integrate it into the vehicles during production.\n\nCar companies typically have to seek many different supply chains, roughly breaking down into hardware and software. Waymo is betting that by building both the hardware and software into one system, it can make the technology more valuable. It’s easier, for instance, to negotiate one deal than multiple agreements. As Krafcik said in his keynote, the software and hardware are also more closely integrated.\n\nAlready, the company is being mentioned in the same breath as the players it wants to beat. On Ford’s quarterly earnings call Thursday, an analyst asked whether Ford would consider sharing data with suppliers like Waymo or Mobileye to create standardized HD maps for the industry. Ford CEO Mark Fields responded the company would have to determine whether it’s ceding a competitive advantage to other automakers by sharing the data.\n\nStill, that doesn’t mean it’s in the bag for Waymo.\n\nFor one, we’ve seen a number of suppliers that automakers are already working with strike up partnerships in the last few months.\n\nIn August, Delphi and Mobileye (which supplies sensor technology) announced the companies were partnering to develop a fully self-driving system that automakers can begin to integrate into their vehicles in 2019. BMW has already said it will integrate that system into a fleet of its vehicles.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia also announced it would begin working with hardware suppliers Bosch and ZF and would power Audi’s self-driving system.\n\nMore importantly, automakers have had long-standing relationships with these suppliers. It’s a close network that is difficult to infiltrate, one insider argued. Yet another said there are still opportunities. Tesla, for instance, stopped working with Mobileye after a fatal car crash.\n\n“Every automaker works with hundreds of suppliers,” the source said. “So I don’t think it’s fair to say that they wouldn’t drop one [company] in favor of another.”\n\nBut perhaps the biggest obstacle for Waymo is that it is owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet. Automakers have long steered clear of partnering with consumer-facing companies like Apple and Google for fear of ceding their in-car experience and brand. Traditional suppliers like Bosch and Delphi are generally known only to gear-heads and mechanics.\n\nIt’s why, many sources say, few carmakers were initially willing to partner with Google or even Uber on the companies’ respective self-driving efforts. They didn’t want to simply bend metal for what would inevitably become seen as the Google or Uber car.\n\nBut when Krafcik officially unveiled Waymo to the world, he repeatedly referred to the vehicles the company’s technology will power as “our” cars.\n\n“Our next step as Waymo will be to let people use our vehicles to do everyday things like run errands, commute to work, or get safely home after a night on the town,” he said.\n\nIt’s semantics, certainly. But it’s a departure from the way most suppliers operate: Behind the scenes.\n\nIt’s unclear that Waymo would be willing to work quietly under the hood. So while there’s a substantial value proposition in developing the full stack of technology in house, it’s not the only thing that matters to automakers when determining which players to partner with.\n\nUpdate: The headline was updated to reflect that Waymo will be taking on suppliers, not becoming a traditional supplier.\n\nLive at Google with their self-driving car We're at Google taking a look at their autonomous car with their head of self-driving technology. Ask questions! Posted by Recode on Monday, October 3, 2016", "Editors' note, February 2, 2017: This piece has been updated with new details now that we're back from CES. My overall assessment remains the same.\n\nGiven the surprising success of the Amazon Echo -- a smart speaker that responds to your voice commands, plays music, and controls your smart home -- competition was inevitable. With Google Home entering the arena, complete with the backing of the company's ubiquitous search engine, the Echo's place on top is no longer secure.\n\n3:42 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF\n\nNow, Google Home has been out for a couple of months and we have full rated reviews of both it and the Echo. Like the Echo, the Home functions as a source of entertainment, a personal assistant, and a smart home controller. You can buy the Home now for $130. The Echo costs $180. You can also get Amazon's assistant Alexa in a smaller package that you can plug into your own sound system -- called the Amazon Echo Dot for $50.\n\nBefore we tested the Home, I expected it to win for entertainment and as a personal assistant, and I expected Alexa to win as a smart home controller. Let's see if that holds true.\n\nGoogle Home vs. Amazon Echo Google Home Amazon Echo Price $130 $180 Responds to voice commands Yes Yes Always listening Yes Yes Wake word Okay Google or Hey Google Alexa, Echo, or Amazon Music streaming options Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Spotify, Pandora, TuneIn Amazon Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, TuneIn, others Smart home partnerships Nest, SmartThings, Philips Hue, Belkin WeMo, Honeywell, IFTTT Nest, Ecobee, Honeywell, SmartThings, Wink, Insteon, Belkin WeMo, Philips Hue, Lifx, Big Ass Fans, IFTTT, Control4, Crestron, other devices via skills Customizable appearance Yes No Output to stereo system Yes, via Chromecast No (yes with Amazon Dot) Synced audio playback to multiple devices Yes, to any Google Cast device No Personal assistant highlights Search Google, get a personalized daily briefing, check traffic, check your calendar, make a shopping list, check flight status, track a package Add items to calendar, make a shopping list, make a to do list, check flight status, track a package Other features Cast to your TV with Chromecast, launch and control YouTube or Netflix via Chromecast Order a pizza, play a game, arrange an Uber pickup. Echo has an ever-growing list of thousands of skills and counting\n\nEntertainment\n\nThe Amazon Echo and the Google Home are both always listening due to their built-in microphones that can hear voice input from a moderate distance. The Echo wakes up to the command \"Alexa\" or you can change the wake word to \"Echo,\" \"Amazon\" or \"Computer.\" The Home listens for either \"Okay Google\" or \"Hey Google.\" Both do a fine job of hearing you even across a large room and over moderate background noise. If you turn the volume all the way up on your music, both will understandably have trouble picking your voice out of the racket.\n\n1:29 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF\n\nAs speakers, both function well enough for listening to music. Though neither lived up to the standards of CNET's audiophiles. Check out Ty Pendlebury's detailed breakdown of how the Home does vs the Echo as far as sound quality. In short, he recommends that if you're looking strictly for a Bluetooth speaker -- keep looking.\n\nOn the plus side, both offer ways of connecting to your existing sound system. The mini version of the Echo -- the Amazon Echo Dot -- plugs into your speakers. With the Home, you can control any Google Cast enabled speaker or any speaker connected to a Chromecast Audio streamer.\n\nBonus points for the Home: you can also control your TV if you have a Chromecast video streamer. Say the word, and you can watch your favorite show on Netflix or pull up a video on YouTube. I haven't found the YouTube integration that useful -- you have to cast a specific video by name and you can't use Google Home to browse videos.\n\nThe Netflix integration comes more naturally to me. I can simply say \"Hey Google, play Parks and Rec on the living room TV\" and it'll start playing. Just like with music, you can pause, rewind, and fast forward streaming video with your voice.\n\nBetter yet, if your TV supports CEC (Consumer Electronics Control), you can turn on your TV with Google Home by asking it to play something. With certain Sony and Vizio TVs, you don't even need to buy a separate streamer, as they have Chromecast built-in. That said, you can't yet fully control any TV with Google Home. You won't be able to turn your TV off with a voice command, for instance.\n\nTyler Lizenby/CNET\n\nAlexa does have some TV integration as well if you have a Fire TV, but you need to press a button on a specific Fire TV remote, so the always-listening Echo can't help you with your TV yet through first party support. Alexa can go above and beyond what Home can do right now if you have a Logitech Harmony setup, but a Chromecast streamer is $35, and a Logitech setup can cost hundreds of dollars.\n\nPlus, with the Home, you can group multiple speakers and play one song simultaneously in multiple rooms of your house.\n\nBoth the Home and Alexa play games, tell jokes, and respond wittily to movie lines such as, \"I am your father.\" Alexa's been around for longer, so she has more fun extras than Google Home. Alexa can lead you on a choose-your-own-adventure-style Batman game. Alexa's Jeopardy game is also much better than Home's simplistic and over-the-top trivia.\n\nStill, I'm giving this category to the Home because extras aside, the Home's ability to group your speakers and cheaply control your TV makes it wonderfully useful as a whole home entertainer.\n\nVerdict: Google Home wins entertainment\n\nPersonal Assistant\n\nGoogle Home learns more about you through a variety of Google services -- Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Maps, so I expected it to easily beat Alexa in this category. Not only can the Home tell you about the appointments on your calendar, it can tell you about traffic on your way to work in the morning.\n\nPlus, the Home uses Google Assistant to respond to voice commands conversationally. Debuted on the company's new Pixel phones, Google made a big show of the assistant's ability to learn from your questions when the company first showed off Google Home back in May.\n\nIn other words, you can ask Google Home \"Who plays Luke Skywalker?\" Thanks to the Google Assistant, the Home will give you an answer. Then, you can follow that question with \"What other movies is he in?\" The Home will infer the \"he\" you're referring to is the actor Mark Hamill and still provide an answer.\n\nThe Home doesn't let you change anything on your calendar yet. It also doesn't integrate with Gmail or Google docs. It won't tell you directions or send directions to your phone. And you can make a shopping list that'll show up in Google Keep, but you can't make any other type of list yet or even set reminders. The Home's integration with Google services didn't actually prove all that helpful in my testing, at least not yet.\n\nAs for the conversational awareness, it's a neat trick, but the Home only understands limited context for now, and surprisingly, Alexa kept up with the Home on this front. We asked Alexa to tell us the weather. Then, we asked, \"How about Friday?\" and Alexa understood and responded without needing to hear the word \"weather\" again.\n\n1:06 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF\n\nThe Home understands a little more context, but not much more. Alexa also lets you set reminders and make to do lists. And the clincher -- Alexa has immense third party support and more than 3,000 skills, which are essentially apps for your Echo. Thanks to those skills, and the fact that Alexa keeps up pretty well with Google Home in contextual awareness, it wins the upset victory in this category. Though, once the Home gets a few updates and a few more integrations with other Google services, this category could easily shift to the Home in the future.\n\nVerdict: Amazon Echo wins as a personal assistant\n\nSmart home controller\n\nSpeaking of those 3,000 skills, with Alexa's two year head start in building a catalog of compatible smart home devices, and given that Google Home launched with just four -- SmartThings, Nest, Philips Hue, and IFTTT -- I didn't think the Home would be able to keep up with the Amazon Echo in this important category.\n\nAn always-listening device makes it much easier for a family to control the smart home. We found that out first hand in the CNET Smart Home, and it's a big part of why Alexa is a central part of our living lab for testing connected gadgets.\n\nWe did that before the Home existed, though, and the Home puts up an admirable fight for smart home supremacy. For one, Home responds more flexibly to commands than Alexa. Both the Home and Alexa pull device names from their respective first party apps -- so the Philips Hue app for Philips bulbs. With Alexa, you can create named groups for your devices. With the Home, you can give them nicknames and group them into rooms.\n\nFor a bulb called \"desk lamp\" in the Philips app, Alexa will only respond if you tell it to turn on the \"desk lamp.\" You can create a group for all lights or office lights, then command Alexa to turn off the office lights and it'll work. Without those groups though, Alexa won't respond to any other names for the lamp, including \"desk light.\"\n\nWith Google Home, I nicknamed the desk lamp \"Lampy,\" and assigned it to the office. I could then control it by commanding Google to turn on the \"desk lamp,\" \"lampy,\" \"desk light,\" \"office light,\" or \"lights.\" Google doesn't get any extra credit for the \"office light\" command since assigning the lamp to the room is similar to adding it to a group for Alexa, but I appreciated the Home automatically grouping it with the rest of my lights and helping me out with the difference between \"light\" and \"lamp.\"\n\nTyler Lizenby/CNET\n\nGoogle's integrations with IFTTT and Philips Hue are also better than Alexa's. With the Home, you can control the colors of your Philips bulbs. You can't do that with a direct command to Alexa right now. With IFTTT -- the online rule maker that stands for \"If This Then That\" -- the Home lets you craft fully customizable commands including multiple options for how you might want to say the command. You have to use the word \"trigger\" to activate a customizable command with Alexa.\n\nFor example, with the Home, I was able to create a rule that allowed me to say \"I'm leaving,\" \"I'm out,\" or \"Switch Ecobee to away mode.\" Home would respond to each of these and switch modes for my Ecobee3 thermostat. You can create the same rule with Alexa, but you'd have to say something like \"Alexa, trigger Ecobee to away mode.\"\n\nThe Home's flexible phrasing could eventually make it better for the smart home than Alexa, as the other members of your family don't have to memorize as many exact commands to control your devices. For now, Alexa's sheer number of skills keeps it on top of this contest, but Google Home makes the battle much closer than I thought it would be.\n\nI was hoping Home might gain some ground in terms of those numbers at CES this year. It had a decent showing, with more integrations than I thought for such a new platform, but Alexa added plenty of partners as well in this category. Here's our scoreboard from the event. Amazon's assistant dominated.\n\nVerdict: Amazon Echo wins as a smart home controller\n\nFinal count\n\nFor now, the Amazon Echo beats the Google Home 2-1 and wins the battle in this exciting new category of devices. Undoubtedly, although this first battle is won, the competition is far from over. The Home will integrate with more smart home platforms, more Google services, and get better and better at understanding context as a conversational assistant. Just don't expect Alexa to sit idly by as Google Home improves.\n\nFor consumers, the competition can only be a good thing. Hopefully, the Home pushes Alexa to be more conversational and Alexa pushes the Home to aggressively pursue third party support. With Apple reportedly also developing a similar device, one thing's for sure: the game is on.\n\nMore Information Read the full CNET Review Google Home The Bottom Line: While the Google Home shows a ton of potential, it's currently not as versatile or useful as Amazon's Echo -- though we expect it to improve in the days and months ahead. Read full review CNET Editors' Rating Very good", "Google today is launching a new mobile application, aimed at helping you better plan your vacations and other travels. Called Google Trips, the iOS and Android app pulls in a combination of data from Google Maps and crowdsourced contributions from other travelers, in order to offer a personalized travel guide that helps you keep track of your day trips, reservations, points of interest, tourist attractions, restaurants and more.\n\nWe already knew Google was working on a travel application, thanks to a leak earlier this year when the app was being tested within Google’s Local Guides community. Local Guides help to improve Google Maps and business data by writing reviews, correcting listings, and taking photos. In return, they gain exclusive access to try out new Google products and features, such as Google Trips.\n\nThe app looks today much like it did then.\n\nThe home screen includes a search box with a prompt “where do you want to go?” for planning new trips, and other cards let you keep track of your current and upcoming vacations and plans.\n\nWhat’s helpful is that each city you plan to visit during one of your trips can each have its own tab within the larger “Trip” section, and with a simple toggle switch, you can download all the information about that destination for offline access.\n\nMeanwhile, on each city’s screen, a variety of colorful cards help you jump into various sections like “Saved places,” “Day Plans,” “Food & Drink,” “Getting around,” “Things to do,” “Reservations,” and more.\n\nBut the app isn’t just for collecting information – it can also make suggestions. Google says Trips can show you the most popular day plans and itineraries for the top 200 cities worldwide. This information is actually based on historic visit data from other travelers, which Google has then assembled into lists that include the most popular sights and attractions.\n\nAlso interesting is how this crowdsourced data is combined with other information pulled from Google Maps to help you find things to do near one of your planned sightseeing destinations.\n\nYou can add a spot you want to visit to your plans, and you even can tell the app if you have only the morning or afternoon available for this outing. The app can then show you other attractions near that original spot, so you can take in other sights worth seeing within having to commute too far.\n\nThis can definitely help with time-constrained trip planning, as it allows you to cram in more activities within a certain vicinity.\n\nPlus, there’s some automation involved here, too – you can tap and pin a spot you have to visit to your itinerary, and Google Trips will automatically fill in the rest of the day for you. Meanwhile, you can also tap a “magic wand” button for more options of nearby sights, then pin those you like to further customize your itinerary.\n\nIn addition to sightseeing, the app can also track flight, hotel, car and restaurant reservations, which makes the app something of a competitor to Concur’s TripIt, and, to some extent, the new territory Airbnb is carving out with its own forthcoming Airbnb Trips app, which will focus on travel services.\n\nHowever, what makes Google Trips compelling is that it leverages Google’s ability to tap into the data you have stored in your Gmail, as it automatically gathers your reservations from your email and organizes them into trips on your behalf.\n\nWhile the new app will be useful for travelers, it will also serve as another means of data collection for Google itself, which will be able to better augment its business listings data in Google Maps with the information collected by the app and its users.\n\nGoogle Trips is live now on Android and iOS.\n\nIn addition to Trips, Google has also now launched its Destinations search feature on the desktop worldwide, following its mobile debut this March.", "Exhibitors of the Google company work on laptop computers in front of an illuminated sign of the Google logo at the industrial fair Hannover Messe in Hanover, Germany on April 17, 2007.\n\nExhibitors of the Google company work on laptop computers in front of an illuminated sign of the Google logo at the industrial fair Hannover Messe in Hanover, Germany on April 17, 2007.

The top trending search term is \"Powerball,\" which is in reference to the $1.56 billion jackpot that three ticket holders won in early 2016. \"Prince,\" \"Hurricane Matthew,\" \"Pokémon Go\" and \"Slither.io\" claimed the rest of the top five, while \"Trump\" and \"Hillary Clinton\" rounded out the end of the list.\n\nLast year , the number one trending search term was \"Lamar Odom,\" the former NBA and reality TV star who was found unconscious in a Nevada brothel last October. \"Jurassic World\" and \"American Sniper\" also placed high on Google's rankings from 2015.\n\nThe term \"trending\" means that these words and phrases held the highest spike in traffic over a sustained period of time in 2016 as compared to 2015.

As the director of the Artificial Intelligence and Vision labs at Stanford University, she oversaw the creation of ImageNet, a vast database of images designed to accelerate the development of AI that can “see.” And, well, it worked, helping to drive the creation of deep learning systems that can recognize objects, animals, people, and even entire scenes in photos—technology that has become commonplace on the world’s biggest photo-sharing sites. Now, Fei-Fei will help run a brand new AI group inside Google, a move that reflects just how aggressively the world’s biggest tech companies are remaking themselves around this breed of artificial intelligence.\n\nAlongside a former Stanford researcher—Jia Li, who more recently ran research for the social networking service Snapchat—the China-born Fei-Fei will lead a team inside Google’s cloud computing operation, building online services that any coder or company can use to build their own AI. This new Cloud Machine Learning Group is the latest example of AI not only re-shaping the technology that Google uses, but also changing how the company organizes and operates its business.\n\nGoogle is not alone in this rapid re-orientation. Amazon is building a similar group cloud computing group for AI. Facebook and Twitter have created internal groups akin to Google Brain, the team responsible for infusing the search giant’s own tech with AI. And in recent weeks, Microsoft reorganized much of its operation around its existing machine learning work, creating a new AI and research group under executive vice president Harry Shum, who began his career as a computer vision researcher.\n\nOren Etzioni, CEO of the not-for-profit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, says that these changes are partly about marketing—efforts to ride the AI hype wave. Google, for example, is focusing public attention on Fei-Fei’s new group because that’s good for the company’s cloud computing business. But Etzioni says this is also part of very real shift inside these companies, with AI poised to play an increasingly large role in our future. “This isn’t just window dressing,” he says.\n\nThe New Cloud\n\nFei-Fei’s group is an effort to solidify Google’s position on a new front in the AI wars. The company is challenging rivals like Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM in building cloud computing services specifically designed for artificial intelligence work. This includes services not just for image recognition, but speech recognition, machine-driven translation, natural language understanding, and more.\n\nCloud computing doesn’t always get the same attention as consumer apps and phones, but it could come to dominate the balance sheet at these giant companies. Even Amazon and Google, known for their consumer-oriented services, believe that cloud computing could eventually become their primary source of revenue. And in the years to come, AI services will play right into the trend, providing tools that allow of a world of businesses to build machine learning services they couldn’t build on their own. Iddo Gino, CEO of RapidAPI, a company that helps businesses use such services, says they have already reached thousands of developers, with image recognition services leading the way.\n\nWhen it announced Fei-Fei’s appointment last week, Google unveiled new versions of cloud services that offer image and speech recognition as well as machine-driven translation. And the company said it will soon offer a service that allows others to access to vast farms of GPU processors, the chips that are essential to running deep neural networks. This came just weeks after Amazon hired a notable Carnegie Mellon researcher to run its own cloud computing group for AI—and just a day after Microsoft formally unveiled new services for building “chatbots” and announced a deal to provide GPU services to OpenAI, the AI lab established by Tesla founder Elon Musk and Y Combinator president Sam Altman.\n\nThe New Microsoft\n\nEven as they move to provide AI to others, these big internet players are looking to significantly accelerate the progress of artificial intelligence across their own organizations. In late September, Microsoft announced the formation of a new group under Shum called the Microsoft AI and Research Group. Shum will oversee more than 5,000 computer scientists and engineers focused on efforts to push AI into the company’s products, including the Bing search engine, the Cortana digital assistant, and Microsoft’s forays into robotics.\n\nThe company had already reorganized its research group to move quickly into new technologies into products. With AI, Shum says, the company aims to move even quicker. In recent months, Microsoft pushed its chatbot work out of research and into live products—though not quite successfully. Still, it’s the path from research to product the company hopes to accelerate in the years to come.\n\n“With AI, we don’t really know what the customer expectation is,” Shum says. By moving research closer to the team that actually builds the products, the company believes it can develop a better understanding of how AI can do things customers truly want.\n\nThe New Brains\n\nIn similar fashion, Google, Facebook, and Twitter have already formed central AI teams designed to spread artificial intelligence throughout their companies. The Google Brain team began as a project inside the Google X lab under another former Stanford computer science professor, Andrew Ng, now chief scientist at Baidu. The team provides well-known services such as image recognition for Google Photos and speech recognition for Android. But it also works with potentially any group at Google, such as the company’s security teams, which are looking for ways to identify security bugs and malware through machine learning.\n\nFacebook, meanwhile, runs its own AI research lab as well as a Brain-like team known as the Applied Machine Learning Group. Its mission is to push AI across the entire family of Facebook products, and according chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer, it’s already working: one in five Facebook engineers now make use of machine learning. Schroepfer calls the tools built by Facebook’s Applied ML group “a big flywheel that has changed everything” inside the company. “When they build a new model or build a new technique, it immediately gets used by thousands of people working on products that serve billions of people,” he says. Twitter has built a similar team, called Cortex, after acquiring several AI startups.\n\nThe New Education\n\nThe trouble for all of these companies is that finding that talent needed to drive all this AI work can be difficult. Given the deep neural networking has only recently entered the mainstream, only so many Fei-Fei Lis exist to go around. Everyday coders won’t do. Deep neural networking is a very different way of building computer services. Rather than coding software to behave a certain way, engineers coax results from vast amounts of data—more like a coach than a player.\n\nAs a result, these big companies are also working to retrain their employees in this new way of doing things. As it revealed last spring, Google is now running internal classes in the art of deep learning, and Facebook offers machine learning instruction to all engineers inside the company alongside a formal program that allows employees to become full-time AI researchers.\n\nYes, artificial intelligence is all the buzz in the tech industry right now, which can make it feel like a passing fad. But inside Google and Microsoft and Amazon, it’s certainly not. And these companies are intent on pushing it across the rest of the tech world too.\n\nUpdate: This story has been updated to clarify Fei-Fei Li’s move to Google. She will remain on the faculty at Stanford after joining Google.", "Should you get Google's Allo? The answer is: Yes!\n\nAs a messaging app, Google's new Allo isn't great. Specifically, it's functionally indistinguishable from any number of apps that have been around for years.\n\nBut there's one reason why you should want to use Allo every day: artificial intelligence.\n\nThere are dozens of messaging apps, and each has its own unique list of features. For example, iPhone users may feel compelled to choose between Apple's iMessage, which recently gained the ability to run iMessage apps, and Allo for iOS.\n\nSo for the sake of understanding Google's new messaging service, let's talk about how iMessage compares with Allo.\n\nWhy iMessage is better than Allo\n\nApple's iMessage service and Messages apps are generally more elegant, polished and appealing to use than Google's Allo. A range of recently launched features make iMessage fun, such as \"invisible ink,\" \"gentle,\" \"loud\" and \"slam\" effects.\n\nAllo, on the other hand, has only the ability to make text larger or smaller, a feature Google calls WhisperShout. (You use WhisperShout by dragging your finger up or down from the send button.)\n\nMac users have a desktop version of Messages, which integrates seamlessly into the mobile versions. I use iMessage via my MacBook Pro, iPad and iPhone. Unfortunately, you can use Allo on just one phone.\n\nStrong encryption for messages between two iMessage users is default and automatic, making iMessages more secure because no explicit action is required to gain full benefit of the end-to-end encryption.\n\nEdward Snowden says: Don't use Allo.\n\nWith Allo, users need to choose end-to-end encryption by using an Incognito mode.\n\nGoogle had previously said it would store only some user messages on its servers, but changed its tune by launch time, saying the company will store all messages unless actively deleted by users or initially sent in Incognito mode.\n\nIn reality, that means most users will leave all messages on Google's servers forever, and those conversations will be available to law enforcement, the NSA and possibly hackers some day.\n\nOn the plus side, Google uses the Signal Protocol for end-to-end encryption while two Allo users have an Incognito conversation, which is very good encryption.\n\nAlso: Because stored data is necessary for Assistant customization, Google doesn't give you Assistant or Smart Reply features in Incognito Mode and doesn't let you delete Assistant conversation data, to the best of my knowledge.\n\nFinally, Apple's entire approach to communication is very clear, while Google's is muddled.\n\nApple has three properties: email (Mail), Facetime (video and voice calling) and iMessage (messaging). Nobody's confused about any of this.\n\nGoogle, on the other hand, has two cloud mail clients (Gmail and Inbox), three voice and/or video apps (Google Voice, Hangouts and Duo) and two messaging apps (Hangouts and Allo). And most users aren't sure which, if any, are defunct or soon to be phased out.\n\nWhy Allo is better than iMessage\n\nWhile you can achieve the equivalent of ephemeral messages with iMessage by installing one of several apps, the option for self-destructing messages is built in to Allo, but only in Incognito Mode. When you enter into Incognito Mode, the default is set for the message to self-destruct in one hour, but you can change that to any of several times within a range of five seconds to one week. You can also set the message to never expire.\n\nGoogle Assistant will do searches within a chat.\n\nApple's iMessage is for Apple hardware and operating systems only. But Google's Allo runs on both Apple platforms and Android. So iPhone and Android users can use Allo to chat with each other without resorting to SMS.\n\nThe best thing about Allo is the Assistant, which is a front end to a kind of next-generation Google Now. Today, Allo is the only place you can use Assistant. Later this year, Google is expected to release an Amazon Echo like device called Home, which uses Assistant through voice interaction.\n\nBy addressing the Assistant directly in Allo, you can ask it to show your pictures, which it grabs from Google Photos. You can say, for example, \"show me pictures of dogs,\" and it will show you your own dog pictures from Google Photos with an option to see other peoples' dog photos from the web.\n\nIt will also reach into your Gmail or Inbox account. By telling the Assistant: \"show me emails from John,\" it will show you the most recent two, with other options like \"My emails from yesterday.\"\n\nWhen you ask for your upcoming flight information, the Assistant pulls data from your email and shows your flight details in a formatted list.\n\nYou can tell it to show your meetings scheduled for tomorrow, your next meeting or your schedule on Monday, and it will do all that, taking the information from Google Calendar.\n\nYou can also add items to the calendar from inside Allo, but this feature didn't work for me -- nor did the setting of timers and alarms.\n\nYou can also launch Google searches from Allo. It will either show you a sample of results in Allo, or it will kick you over to your mobile browser and the Google Search site.\n\nBest of all, the non-personal Assistant results can be summoned from within a group chat, and everyone involved will see them.\n\nYou can also type \"@google play games\" and Google will offer you games that can be played by yourself or with groups.\n\nGoogle Allo offers two distinct and very different kinds of artificial intelligence. In addition to Assistant, you also get Smart Reply.\n\nSmart Reply debuted for Google Inbox on Nov. 3. This simple feature is backed by serious machine intelligence. In Allo, it gives you one or more options for replying. Tapping on a reply both selects and sends the reply -- literally a one-tap operation. Replies tend to be general, short and casual. \"Ok, thanks,\" \"Sounds good\" and \"Will do.\"\n\nWhen my son and I first started using Allo, we both impulsively responded with Smart Reply options. We had a longish back-and-forth conversation using nothing but Smart Reply -- essentially enabling Google to talk to itself through us.\n\nSmart Reply is sometimes smart, sometimes not so much. It suggested that I reply to a male colleague: \"Thanks, sweetie.\" Tempting, but I went ahead and typed a reply myself.\n\nUnlike the Smart Reply feature in Google Inbox, the Allo version offers replies to photos and emoji, with Google A.I. looking at and \"understanding\" the content of images to come up with a reply that could be considered \"smart.\" I sent a photo of a pizza to my brother-in-law, and he was offered Smart Replies of \"I love Italian food,\" \"Yum\" and \"That looks good\" -- then offered him links to nearby Italian restaurants.\n\nThis digression into pizza restaurants is a \"preview edition\" of the Google Assistant, and it's clearly a work in progress. Google promises that these replies will evolve to match your style. \"The more you use it, the more it improves over time,\" according to the official Google announcement.\n\nYou may have heard in May that Google Assistant would launch with Allo. Most users assumed that Assistant would be like another human on your list of contacts, and by addressing the Assistant with questions, you'd get Google Now like answers. But it may surprise you to learn that Assistant listens to your conversations with others, and interjects with helpful information.\n\nThat's right: Google's A.I. follows along with all your conversations, \"understands\" all your photos and emoji and then \"participates\" in the conversation with suggestions of all kinds.\n\nWhy you'll want Google Allo\n\nIf you want my opinion on whether you should install and use Allo, I can tell you the answer is: Yes, of course you should.\n\nThere are legitimate reasons (security, convenience or preference for another messaging app) to not use Allo for communicating with .\n\nBut the Assistant alone is enough reason to use Allo. To have the updated Google Now in an explicitly conversational interface is fantastic.\n\nIf Google's Assistant isn't the most powerful A.I. virtual assistant available, it's certainly the most usable, precisely because it's built right into Allo's messaging conversational UI.\n\nSo forget messaging. Allo is at least an indispensable, all-purpose A.I. bot -- and there's nothing else like it out there.\n\nCorrection: The original article stated that Allo conversations with the Google Assistant could not be deleted. In fact, they can, and Google has published instructions on how to do that.", "Google Photos, Google’s cloud photo storage and sharing service, aspires to be a single home to everyone’s photographs. But so far, that has only extended to the digital photos we take, as well as our personal videos. The company is today working to change that with the launch of a new tool called PhotoScan that can help you to turn printed photos into high-quality digital copies. The end result is that older photos detailing your family’s history and the pre-smartphone era can also become a part of your Google Photos experience.\n\nUnlike digital photos, printed photos tend to showcase more important moments, as people were more choosy about which pictures to take because of the price of film and prints, explains David Lieb, the Product Lead for Google Photos, whose team developed PhotoScan.\n\n“But it’s very likely that you’ll lose these photos permanently,” he adds. Google estimates there are trillions of print photos out there in the world, and it wants to bring them online.\n\nCurrently, there are a handful of ways to turn printed photos into digital ones. You can ship them off via postal mail to a scanning service, you can buy a scanner and manually scan each one by yourself, or you can use your phone to take a picture of the existing, printed photo.\n\nThe latter is what many people already do (as evidenced by the Throwback Thursday postings), simply because it’s easiest.\n\nBut this doesn’t tend to lead to high-quality photos. Instead, images snapped with your smartphone camera tend to have a glare from the overhead light streaked across the image; they often are not properly aligned; and, if not cropped, may even show the table or surface they’re resting on as part of the digital copy.\n\nGoogle PhotoScan instead will help you take photos of these prints, then automatically address all these common problems.\n\nThe way it does this is interesting. The simple mobile app, when launched, takes you directly to the camera’s viewfinder. Overlaid on top of the view of the print you’re about to snap a photo of are four white dots. You guide the phone over each dot by moving it slightly, which allows Google to take multiple shots of the photo from different angles. What you’re doing here is getting different images where the glare has been moved around, too.\n\nAbove: PhotoScan in action\n\nPhotoScan then stitches those together to produce a single image without the glare. The app also automatically rotates the image, aligns it and removes the background (e.g. the tabletop). An in-app editor allows you to make a few tweaks of your own, if desired, too. The photo can be saved to your phone’s photo gallery, where you can share it as you please.\n\nIt’s worth pointing out there are a number of alternatives to PhotoScan on the market, like Photomyne, Ancestry.com’s Shoebox, Heirloom, Memories and others. But while they may crop and straighten, none are using this idea of combining multiple angles to eliminate the glare.\n\nThough designed by Google Photos’ team, PhotoScan doesn’t directly upload to the photo-sharing service. Instead, you’ll need the Google Photos app installed if you want these print-to-digital images to upload automatically.\n\nOnce in Google Photos, the company is also rolling out new, advanced editing tools, including a better “auto enhance” feature, tools for making granular adjustments to light and color in photos and a dozen new photo filters. The filters are also powered by machine learning, and will edit the photo based on its brightness, darkness, warmth or saturation before applying the new style.\n\nThe updated Google Photos app is rolling out today.\n\nPhotoScan is also going live today as a free download on both iOS and Android.", "What happens when you tell two smart computers to talk to each other in secret and task another AI with breaking that conversation? You get one of the coolest experiments in cryptography I’ve seen in a while.\n\nIn short, Google Brain researchers have discovered that the AI, when properly tasked, create oddly inhuman cryptographic schemes and that they’re better at encrypting than decrypting. The paper, “Learning to protect communications with adversarial neural cryptography,” is available here.\n\nThe rules of the task were simple. Two neural networks, Bob and Alice, shared a secret key. Another neural network, Eve, was tasked with reading the communications between the two robots. There was one condition, a “loss function,” for each party. Eve and the recipient Bob’s plaintext had to be as close to the original plaintext as possible while Alice’s loss function depending on how far from random Eve’s guesses were. This created a generative adversarial network among the robots.\n\nWrite the researchers Martın Abadi and David G. Andersen:\n\n￼Informally, the objectives of the participants are as follows. Eve’s goal is simple: to reconstruct P accurately (in other words, to minimize the error between P and PEve). Alice and Bob want to com- municate clearly (to minimize the error between P and PBob), but also to hide their communication from Eve. Note that, in line with modern cryptographic definitions (e.g., (Goldwasser & Micali, 1984)), we do not require that the ciphertext C “look random” to Eve. A ciphertext may even con- tain obvious metadata that identifies it as such. Therefore, it is not a goal for Eve to distinguish C from a random value drawn from some distribution. In this respect, Eve’s objectives contrast with common ones for the adversaries of GANs. On the other hand, one could try to reformulate Eve’s goal in terms of distinguishing the ciphertexts constructed from two different plaintexts.\n\nThe methods evolved over time and eventually Bob and Alice were able to communicate clearly using the shared key. Eve, on the other hand, had some luck decrypting the systems until Bob and Alice became proficient and then her ability to crack the cipher failed. Bob and Alice, on the other hand, got really good at sharing encrypted information and many of their techniques were quite odd and unexpected, depending on calculations that weren’t common in “human generated” encryption.\n\nUltimately the researchers found that Bob and Alice were good at devising a solid encryption protocol on their own as long as they valued security. Eve, on the other hand, had a heck of a time decrypting their communications. This means robots will be able to talk to each other in ways that we – or other robots – won’t be able to crack. I, for one, welcome our robotic cryptographic overlords.\n\nFeatured Image: Dan Bruins", "I had been an Android user (a Nexus user, to be precise) since day one of my smartphone journey. I avoided the iPhone due to Apple’s tight-fisted control over hardware and software. But in 2015, when T-Mobile announced the Jump on Demand program, I jumped on the iPhone bandwagon and bought my first iPhone knowing that I could switch to up to three new devices in a year.\n\nThere were a lot of things in the iPhone 6S Plus (find it on Amazon) that I loved, including the camera (especially the burst shots feature).\n\nI also liked the family sharing of purchased applications, games, movies, music, TV shows and eBooks. I ended up moving my wife, our au-pair and my son to iPhone because at that time Google didn't offer a family sharing plan. Instead of buying the same content four times for each device, I could buy once and share across those users.\n\nWhat I liked most was that my iOS devices OS updates immediately, and all at the same time. That contrasted with Nexus where some of my devices would get over the air (OTA) updates a few days after Google announced them and some would not get them for weeks. And the update situation was worse for my wife and other family members who used Samsung and Motorola devices. These devices would not see OS updates for another year or so after they were released.\n\nAnd then there was the vendor lock within Android. Samsung offers apps for its Smart TV or other devices only for Galaxy phones. Our Nexus and Motorola devices, despite running Android, would not run those apps.\n\nSticking to iPhone was a no-brainer and as soon as Apple released iPhone 7 Plus (find it on Amazon), I pre-ordered it via the T-Mobile Jump on Demand program.\n\nBy that time I had lost interest in Android and also bought the iPad Pro. My Nexus devices started to collect dust. I had become an iOS user.\n\nThen Pixel happened.\n\nWhen Google announced Pixel phones, killing the Nexus family, I had zero excitement; I was a happy iPhone user.\n\nDuring a recent tech conference, I played with the Pixel Phone of fellow journalist Frederic Lardinois who writes for TechCrunch. After using not Android for so long, I realized all that I was missing. At that time Pixel was out of stock, so I asked Google and they were kind enough to send the 32 GB version of Pixel XL (find it on Amazon) for me to review.\n\nI have been playing with the Pixel for a few weeks now and I find myself debating whether to go back to Android, stick with iOS or keep both.\n\nDecision points\n\nCamera: Initially I liked the iPhone 7 camera, but when I compared shots with my Nikon D750, I found that the tiny sensor and tiny lens on the iPhone were no match for my full format DSLR sensor and 50mm f/1.4 prime lens. There was no comparison between the sharpness, depth of field, color accuracy and overall quality of the images shot with my DSLR. If you are someone who never owned anything other than a cheap point and shoot camera, iPhone is good for you. But if you are really into photography, then don’t listen to any of those people who recommend iPhone over DSLR. Yes, you can get a few good shots in really perfect lighting conditions, but beyond that when you look back at your pictures you will regret not shooting them from your DSLR.\n\nFamily sharing: Without much fanfare, Google has brought family sharing to Android, allowing you to add up to five family members to your account. The only gripe I have is that unlike Apple, Google doesn’t offer any options for kids under 18, so while I can have my kids' accounts on iOS devices, I can’t do the same on Android and I have to give access to my account, which is less than ideal.\n\nOTA Updates: I am never going to buy a device that drifts away from stock Android (I am looking at you Samsung) and delays updates. While Nexus was a developer device, Pixels are great consumer devices that compete directly with iPhones. And Pixel will get updates as usual. So that’s not a deal breaker either.\n\nEntertainment: I don’t play games on my phone or watch movies on it. Yes, I do use it for music. Apple Music has a very tiny selection when compared with Google Music and iTunes. If you want to listen to old German songs, YouTube has it. You want new year’s songs, YouTube has it. You want old Indian classical songs, YouTube has it. Apple Music, on the other hand, has none of those options. On top of that if you pay for YouTube Red, not only do you get an ad-free experience and ability to download videos and songs for offline playback, you also get access to Google Music, for free.\n\nAirPlay vs Google Cast: As much as I liked AirPlay, Apple’s tight control over the protocol has left me with very few devices that work with AirPlay. With Chromecast, however, I can turn any great speaker into a smart speaker.\n\nSharing is easier: Both iOS and Android offer sandboxing, restricting applications within the permissions you have given them. But it’s more annoying and frustrating to share content across applications in iOS. For example, you can’t directly upload images to your Dropbox folder from the photo app. You have to open the Dropbox app to upload images. On Android, once you install an app, you can access that app from anywhere. It’s very easy to work across apps on Android.\n\nBackup and upload: If you want to keep a backup of your images and videos on Dropbox and Google Drive, iOS is going to make your life miserable. Apple fills up your space very quickly forcing you to buy iCloud storage. So you may want to keep a copy of your files on Dropbox or Google Drive. Even if you enable background upload, iOS pauses these apps after a certain time so your uploads will pause. You have to keep that app open in order for upload to work. Apple allows iCloud to keep uploading. It’s a heavy-handed approach that really annoys me. On Android, once you give an app permission for background upload, you can rest assured that all your files will be backed up.\n\nData transfer: Apple doesn’t expose the file system on iOS so you can’t see the file system and manage your own files as you can on your PC. You can’t plug in your iOS device to a computer and transfer files. No. You. Can’t. On Android, Google exposes the file system and you can easily manage your files using a file manager. You can plug in your Android device to your PC and easily transfer files. Simple.\n\nOpen app ecosystem: It’s no news, but Apple doesn’t allow me to install apps from outside the App Store. They want complete control over the app ecosystem to get their 30 percent cut from each purchase. On Android, you can easily install apps from outside the Google Play Store. Easy.\n\nUnlike many who find jumped into Apple's ecosystem with both feet, it won’t be hard for me to switch because when I bought the iPhone I made a conscious decision to use only those apps and service that are not exclusive to iOS. The apps that I use are also available on Android so I can very easily jump ship.\n\nSiri vs. Google Assistant: After all these years Siri hasn't grown much. It is still nothing more than a gimmick that can’t do anything smart. Google Assistant has shown us what true AI is (read my article on Amazon Echo vs. Google Home). Once you have used Google Assistant, you will never go back to Siri.\n\nConclusion: After looking at all these points, I see no reason for sticking to the iPhone. Pixel has much more to offer. Looking at the open app ecosystem, ease of navigation, ease of sharing, the smartest virtual assistant, etc., switching to Pixel is a no brainer.\n\niPhone may have the retina display, but Google's phone is Pixel perfect.\n\nRelated video:", "In one experiment, researchers at the Google Brain artificial intelligence research group had software design a machine-learning system to take a test used to benchmark software that processes language. What it came up with surpassed previously published results from software designed by humans.\n\nIn recent months several other groups have also reported progress on getting learning software to make learning software. They include researchers at the nonprofit research institute OpenAI (which was cofounded by Elon Musk), MIT, the University of California, Berkeley, and Google’s other artificial intelligence research group, DeepMind.\n\nIf self-starting AI techniques become practical, they could increase the pace at which machine-learning software is implemented across the economy. Companies must currently pay a premium for machine-learning experts, who are in short supply.\n\nJeff Dean, who leads the Google Brain research group, mused last week that some of the work of such workers could be supplanted by software. He described what he termed “automated machine learning” as one of the most promising research avenues his team was exploring.\n\n“Currently the way you solve problems is you have expertise and data and computation,” said Dean, at the AI Frontiers conference in Santa Clara, California. “Can we eliminate the need for a lot of machine-learning expertise?”\n\nOne set of experiments from Google’s DeepMind group suggests that what researchers are terming “learning to learn” could also help lessen the problem of machine-learning software needing to consume vast amounts of data on a specific task in order to perform it well.\n\nThe researchers challenged their software to create learning systems for collections of multiple different, but related, problems, such as navigating mazes. It came up with designs that showed an ability to generalize, and pick up new tasks with less additional training than would be usual.\n\nThe idea of creating software that learns to learn has been around for a while, but previous experiments didn’t produce results that rivaled what humans could come up with. “It’s exciting,” says Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal, who previously explored the idea in the 1990s.\n\nBengio says the more potent computing power now available, and the advent of a technique called deep learning, which has sparked recent excitement about AI, are what’s making the approach work. But he notes that so far it requires such extreme computing power that it’s not yet practical to think about lightening the load, or partially replacing, machine-learning experts.\n\nGoogle Brain’s researchers describe using 800 high-powered graphics processors to power software that came up with designs for image recognition systems that rivaled the best designed by humans.\n\nOtkrist Gupta, a researcher at the MIT Media Lab, believes that will change. He and MIT colleagues plan to open-source the software behind their own experiments, in which learning software designed deep-learning systems that matched human-crafted ones on standard tests for object recognition.\n\nGupta was inspired to work on the project by frustrating hours spent designing and testing machine-learning models. He thinks companies and researchers are well motivated to find ways to make automated machine learning practical.\n\n“Easing the burden on the data scientist is a big payoff,” he says. “It could make you more productive, make you better models, and make you free to explore higher-level ideas.”" ] }

Google was even going to give it equal billing with JavaScript in its Chrome browser. But by the time Dart was ready for prime time, JavaScript — and the massive ecosystem around it — was already miles ahead. About a year and a half ago, Google gave up on the idea of Dart as a direct JavaScript competitor and instead repositioned it as a compile-to-JavaScript language along the lines of TypeScript or CoffeeScript.\n\nSince then, it got rather quiet around Dart. But that’s about to change. Google is hosting a Dart developer conference in Munich this week that marks Dart’s return into the spotlight. Internally, Dart has also been a major success at Google. Both the AdWords and AdSense teams (which drive most of Google’s revenue), as well as the Google Fiber teams, now rely on it to write their consumer-facing web apps. The AdSense update is already live and the next-gen AdWords interface is currently in testing and will launch more broadly in the near future. The Google teams that use it report that it gives them a 25 to 100 percent increase in development speed. Inside of Google, Dart is also now the fastest growing programming language, and the number of lines of Dart code written by Google developers has increased by 3.5x over the course of the last year (though, to be fair, it’s probably starting from a relatively low base, so I would take that “fastest growing” moniker with a grain of salt).\n\nOutside of Google, companies like Wrike, Workiva, Blossom and others have also been using Dart to develop their products, so there is definitely still a Dart user community outside of Google, too.\n\nAs Dart co-founder Kasper Lund admitted when I talked to him about Dart’s comeback attempt, the original idea for Dart “may have been too ambitious a start. It was very hard for us to follow that strategy [of building out a Dart runtime in the browser] and target the entire modern web,” he told me. At the same time, though, the team did experience a lot of success with its language and tools without even having the runtime in Chrome. That’s because the team had already built a Dart-to-JavaScript compiler to make sure that the code Dart developers wrote could also run outside of Chrome (even if it would’ve run faster in Chrome).\n\nHaving realized that, the team pivoted away from developing a runtime and instead focused all of its energy on the Dart-to-JavaScript compiler and the toolset around it.\n\nHaving both the Dart and JavaScript runtime in Chrome actually made it harder for the two languages to interact, Lund tells me. That’s not an issue anymore and the team was able to get rid of all the dependencies it originally built to make that happen. In return, Dart can now more easily work with third-party tools; the one the team has been especially focused on is Angular, Google’s framework for building web and mobile apps.\n\nBy default, Angular 2.0 uses Microsoft’s TypeScript as its preferred language. Unsurprisingly, for AngularDart 2.0, which is launching out of beta today, that language is Dart. At its event in Munich this week, the team is also releasing many of the AngularDart Material Design components it developed for its internal teams (think date-picker widgets, etc.) as a developer preview.\n\nAs far as the language itself, Dart is getting an optional strong mode that essentially turns Dart into a strongly typed language, as well as generic methods. Google also promises that the compiler can now compile most code to JavaScript in less than a second.\n\nWith Flutter, Google is also launching a new project into preview that allows developers to write both iOS and Android apps from a single Dart codebase. Flutter’s widgets use a functional-reactive framework — if that sounds familiar, that’s probably because the overall idea isn’t that different from Facebook’s React Native (something the team freely admits). React Native does have a significant head start, though, but for Google, the overall idea here is to be able to give developers a full Dart toolkit that addresses the majority of use cases.\n\nGiven Dart’s popularity inside of Google, Dart is obviously not going away anytime soon. And that’s really the message the company is trying to send this week. Given its history, the team will have to work hard to get outside developers on board, though.", "Facebook\n\n\n\nFacebook might not be as cool as Snapchat, but it still has the most popular app in the US, according to a Nielsen report for 2016 published Wednesday.\n\nIn a year where Pokemon Go smashed App Store records, social media still remains the dominant force on people's phones. Facebook remains comfortable as America's most popular app with more than 146 million monthly users. The company has been adding features to its app over the last year, like games, its own marketplace and its many, many attempts to be Snapchat.\n\nThe social network giant took first and second place in Nielsen's ranking, with 129 million unique users for Facebook Messenger. Instagram, which Facebook bought for $1 billion in 2012, was 2016's eighth most popular app, with 74 million average monthly users. The photo-sharing app's user number grew by more than one-third from 2015.\n\nEnlarge Image Nielsen\n\nFacebook boasts an average 1.8 billion monthly active users internationally, as the largest social network in the world. But while Facebook was able to clinch the top spot, its apps were not spread as widely as Google's influence.\n\nThe search engine titan claimed five spots on the Top 10 list, with a combined 508 million users across its popular apps.\n\nYouTube, the mega-popular streaming site it owns, was Google's largest contribution, with 113 million people using the app. Google Maps followed with 105 million users. Google Search, the Play Store and Gmail had 103 million, 99 million and 88 million users, respectively.\n\nGoogle's Android mobile operating system also edged out its rival Apple in 2016, with 53 percent of US smartphone owners running on Android, compared to 45 percent of owners using iOS. Only 1 percent of smartphone owners are using BlackBerry.\n\nWhile Facebook and Google have managed to stay on top for 2016, Amazon's app saw the most growth this year, with a 43 percent increase since 2015. The web retailer giant now boasts 65 million users on its app.\n\nIf you're trying to find the hidden gems that aren't the most popular apps, check out our recommendations for the best apps for iOS and Android. (My apologies to the one percent of BlackBerry users out there.)", "The good news is that the digital-advertising industry is growing strongly, with revenues up sharply in 2016. The bad news? Virtually all of that growth is going to exactly two companies: Google and Facebook.\n\nThe latest figures from the Interactive Advertising Bureau show that the third quarter last year was the biggest ever, with a total of $17.6 billion spent on digital ads. That's a 20% increase from the same period a year earlier, thanks to growth in mobile and video. This growth \"reflects marketers' trust in the internet’s power to connect with today’s audiences,\" the IAB said.\n\nIf you look beneath the surface, however, it also reflects the fact that a majority of those audiences are controlled by Google ( goog ) and Facebook ( fb ) —and if anything, their control is accelerating.\n\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\n\nLast year, Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser estimated that digital advertising revenue in 2015 also soared by 20% from the previous year to a record of $60 billion. Close to 65% of that went to Google and Facebook, he said, with the search giant taking $30 billion and Facebook taking $8 billion.\n\n\"Smaller companies will continue to operate in the shadows of the industry’s two dominant players,\" Wieser told investors in a research note at the time.\n\nHalfway through last year, Jason Kint of the advertising trade group Digital Content Next looked at the total ad revenue booked by those two companies as a proportion of the overall industry, and found that they accounted for about 90% of all the growth in the business.\n\nLast week, Kint updated those figures, and the picture they paint has become even more bleak. Based on the IAB's numbers and public financial numbers from Google and Facebook, the two digital giants accounted for about 99% of the $2.9 billion in advertising growth in the third quarter—with Google making up about 54% of the total and Facebook about 45%, leaving just 1% for everyone else.\n\nupdated duopoly #s. new IAB data came out yesterday. easy to run vs earnings for goog and fb, it's evident everyone else is zero sum game. pic.twitter.com/wolgdpfcxp - Jason Kint (@jason_kint) December 30, 2016\n\nThis duopoly control has had an increasing impact on the advertising-tech market as well, something that used to be a growth area both for publishers and for ad networks. According to a recent analysis by the Financial Times , both the number of financing deals and the amount raised by ad-tech companies has declined sharply in the past year.\n\nThe number of ad-tech companies raising money dropped 17% last year compared with the year earlier, data from CBInsights shows, and the total volume of funding fell 33% to $2.2 billion from $3.2 billion, putting it back where it was in 2013.\n\n\"Ad tech’s struggle as a sector is absolutely to do with the dominance of Facebook and Google,\" Balderton Capital venture partner Suranga Chandratillake told the FT . \"Ultimately advertising is about selling attention, and if most of that attention is focused on Google and Facebook, then naturally they can monetize it.\" He added:\n\n\"Even if you manage to build a sustainable advantage for a few years, how do you scale to compete with Google or Facebook? That’s why traditional adtech does feel dead from a venture perspective.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with ad industry veteran Jay Sears, Pivotal's Wieser said the digital-media industry has effectively become a giant duopoly in which Google and Facebook win almost everything, advertisers have to play by their rules, and other media companies \"fight for the scraps.\"\n\nNew York-based venture investor Fred Wilson, meanwhile, predicted in a forecast for 2017 that \"the ad:tech market will go the way of search, social, and mobile as investors and entrepreneurs concede that Google and Facebook have won and everyone else has lost.\" It will be nearly impossible to raise money for an online advertising business in 2017.\"\n\nThis is how modern political advertising works:\n\nIn the past, digital advertising may have been seen as an add-on or supplement to traditional advertising markets, but that is no longer the case. According to estimates from eMarketer, spending on digital ads in the U.S. will likely grow this year to the point where it is larger than the amount spent on television, the former Goliath of the industry.\n\nData on users and their preferences and behavior is the Holy Grail for most advertisers, and the reality is that Google and Facebook have orders of magnitude more data than their nearest competitors, and more ways to slice and dice it.\n\nIn the case of Facebook, the company has more than 1.5 billion users—far more than any other single media business commands—and it tracks what they see and click on in ways that most media companies can only dream of. And that means advertisers will continue to work with them even when they admit that their data was wrong, as Facebook has several times .\n\nTwitter and Snapchat are trying to compete on the same playing field as Google and Facebook, but both remain bit players so far. So is the future for media companies simply one of deciding which of two giant walled gardens they wish to build a majority of their business on, or pay rent to? For the moment, at least, that appears to be the case.", "Daydream is Google’s VR platform of the future\n\n\n\nGoogle now has a mobile virtual reality platform. It's called Daydream, and it's built on top of Android N. That means it's not going to compete with the likes of the PC-powered HTC Vive or Oculus Rift (at least not yet, anyway), but looks much more powerful than Cardboard and represents a huge step in the push to advance VR out of its early stages.\n\n\n\nFrom the sound of it, Daydream is a lot like Android for VR. It's a backbone of software inside Android N (simply known as \"VR Mode\") that provides users with an entire ecosystem to play around in. There will be a home screen with apps (which looks a lot like the Gear VR's home screen, to be honest), and Google has apparently already created special VR versions of its own apps like YouTube, Street View, the Google Play Store, Play Movies, and Google Photos. Other companies, like The New York Times, HBO, Netflix, Ubisoft, and Electronic Arts are already developing for Daydream as well.\n\n\n\nThe biggest limitation for Daydream seems to be that it will only work on new phones that have special sensors and screens. Google says that those Daydream-ready phones will be available this fall, and that we can expect to see them from Samsung, HTC, LG, Huawei, and more. The company is also releasing reference designs for headsets as a way of encouraging phonemakers to get on board with the platform.", "Enlarge Image Josh Miller/CNET\n\nIf you own a Google Wifi or OnHub router, you may have to do set it up all over again.\n\nAfter investigating reports of faulty devices, Google released a statement to customers Thursday saying an issue with Google Accounts caused many Google Wifi and OnHub routers to reset themselves.\n\n\"They will unfortunately need to be set up again,\" the statement said. \"This has not affected the software or performance of the device but it does need to be re-setup.\"\n\nHours earlier, many users had taken to forums and social media to voice their dissatisfaction and confusion.\n\nIt's not a great start for Google Wifi, an otherwise excellent router that launched three months ago.

A map of the entire continent will pop up, along with prices. You’ll be able to compare how much it would cost to fly to London versus Paris — and you can even filter the options by type of airline, duration of flight and price you’re willing to pay.\n\nGoogle\n\n3. Or go with “I’m feeling lucky” to let Google plan your dream trip.\n\nWhat “I’m feeling lucky” does for search, it also does for flights. Click on a map within Google Flights, pick your departure spot, and click the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to let Google choose a destination based on your search history and what’s popular. You’ll also see a bar graph letting you know when flights will be at their cheapest.\n\nGoogle\n\n4. Google will tell you which flight is the best bang for your buck.\n\nThe “best flights” box tells you which flights are the best combinations of price and speed, so you won’t have to decide whether a layover is a good idea or if a nonstop is worth the extra buck. Google also highlights its top pick in green. It’s like having your very own travel agent say, “If I were you, I’d do this.”\n\nGoogle\n\n5. It’ll also show you the lowest price for any given day on the calendar.\n\nYou can see prices for your trip on every day of the month, with the cheapest days highlighted in green. A bar graph at the bottom lets you know how prices will likely drop or rise over time.\n\nGoogle\n\n6. Automatically see swaps that save you money.\n\nIf you search for a flight that has a similar yet less expensive option, the “tip” bar lets you know how much money you’ll save if you’re willing to fly earlier, later or from a different airport. Then you can weigh the cost and decide!\n\nGoogle\n\n7. Once you find a potential flight, let Google monitor the price for you.\n\nIf you find a flight you like, then hit the “save this itinerary” button and let the Google Now app track its pricing. You can hit the app on your phone to see how prices are changing, and Google will email you if they dip dramatically.\n\nGoogle", "Since Pixel is the first true \"phone by Google,\" many consumers are hoping for the kind of unified software and hardware presentation that can be missing from Android environments, but has long been an Apple mainstay. But what about specs? Here's a nuts-and-bolts comparison of the Pixel and iPhone 7.\n\n\n\nSize\n\nMany Android manufacturers make their phones a little larger and flatter than iPhones, and Google is no exception. The Pixel is about 4-percent taller and wider than the iPhone 7, but only 0.2-millimeter thicker.\n\nKeep in mind that each phone is the \"little brother\" within its lineup. The Pixel XL and the iPhone 7 Plus are both bigger phones, and we'll take a side-by-side look at those separately.\n\nWeight\n\nThe bigger Pixel is proportionately heavier. It weighs 3.5-percent (about the weight of a nickel) more than the iPhone.\n\nBuild\n\nIn terms of construction, both phones play it safe with a glass front and aluminum unibody.\n\nColors\n\nThe iPhone has more color options, with matte black, glossy black and three metallic tones. Pixel keeps it simple with black, blue and silver. Let's be honest though – those colors are probably going under a phone case, anyway.\n\nWater resistance\n\nThis year, we saw improved water resistance in mobile technology across the board. Even though this is the first year iPhones have had a water resistance rating (they can withstand accidental immersion in water up to one meter deep, for up to half an hour), a lack of water resistance in the Pixel seems like a misstep.\n\nDisplay size\n\nIt's no surprise that the bigger Pixel has a larger display. Neither phone optimizes its screen-to-size ratio particularly well, though. They both have significant blank space on their \"chins\" and \"foreheads\".\n\nDisplay resolution\n\nPixel lives up to its name and wins the pixel density war handily (which is important for using the phone as a VR device – see below). Still, resolution isn't the only indicator of a quality display. The iPhone gets kudos for its color accuracy and contrast. We'll have to take a closer look at the Pixel in our forthcoming full-length review.\n\nDisplay type\n\nApple is one of the few manufacturers still clinging to IPS display technology; Google uses AMOLED in the Pixel. We're still not sure if this means the Pixel will have an \"always-on\" display mode like many other AMOLED-sporting flagships do, though it does not appear to.\n\nPressure-sensitive display\n\nThis feature can be difficult to describe to folks that haven't picked up an iPhone in a while. Current iPhones (with the exception of the dainty SE) come equipped with a pressure-sensitive display, which provides navigational shortcuts based on how long and hard you press the screen. Apple calls this bit of technology \"3D Touch.\" To us, 3D Touch has potential, but it hasn't been realized yet.\n\nCamera megapixels\n\nPixel sneaks past the iPhone with one more megapixel in the selfie camera, where it counts the most.\n\nCamera aperture (rear)\n\niPhone bests the Pixel in terms of camera aperture. The smaller the f-stop, the larger the aperture, which is generally a good thing. It means more light can access the imaging sensor, for better photos in low-light conditions.\n\nOptical image stabilization\n\nOptical image stabilization staves off unwanted photo blur that arises from hand shake and long exposure times. iPhone has it, Pixel doesn't.\n\nDual rear camera\n\nJust to be clear, it's the iPhone 7 Plus that comes equipped with an optical zoom-enabling dual lens rear camera. Both of these phones have a single lens.\n\nBattery\n\nThe Pixel has a considerably bigger battery than the iPhone 7. Google estimates that a full charge will get you up to 26 hours of talk time or up to 13 hours of internet use or video playback. On the iPhone 7, Apple says you'll get up to 14 hours of talk time, 12 hours of internet use, or up to 13 hours of video playback.\n\nFast charging\n\nAccording to Google, the Pixel can get up to 7 hours of use from only 15 minutes of charging. iPhone users are still waiting for similar convenience.\n\nWireless charging\n\nNeither phone can be charged wirelessly.\n\nProcessor\n\nWe'll perform a benchmark test on the Pixel soon, but it seems like Apple's A10 fusion chip is a touch faster than the duly capable Snapdragon 821 in the Pixel.\n\nRAM\n\nPixel has twice the RAM of the iPhone 7, so it should be well equipped for any software application. Still, it is worth mentioning that iPhones have always performed efficiently with relatively low amounts of RAM.\n\nStorage\n\nBoth phones are available in 32 or 128-gigabyte capacities. In addition, iPhone 7 has an extremely capacious 256-gigabyte option. If you want the new glossy black iPhone, you'll have to spring for one of the two larger sizes, as the 32 GB size is not available in jet black.\n\nmicroSD\n\nExternal storage has never been an iPhone option, but many Android adherents may be frustrated about microSD missing from the Pixel, a Nexus/Pixel tradition.\n\nVR compatible\n\nPixel is compatible with the new Google Daydream View virtual reality (VR) headset. In fact, it's even shipping with Daydream for free in the U.S. as part of a temporary pre-order promotion.\n\nOnce Daydream View ships in November, we'll be able to weigh it up against the current leading mobile VR headset, Gear VR. We are excited to check out Daydream's microfiber construction and test its accompanying controller. Considering that consumer VR hit the market this year in a big way, we're wondering if and when Apple will follow suit.\n\nHeadphone jack\n\nApple's never been shy about axing hardware; the headphone jack on the iPhone hit the chopping block this year. iPhone 7 does ship with a headphone-to-Lightning adapter as well as Lightning port earbuds, but if you want to use your current headphones without any extra cordage, opt for a Pixel.\n\nFingerprint sensor\n\nBoth phones have fingerprint sensors, and both manufacturers bestow upon them a glib proprietary moniker: Google's is \"Pixel Imprint\" and Apple's is \"Touch ID\". The Pixel's scanner is on the back of the phone. On the iPhone, the fingerprint scanner is built into the home button.\n\nHome button\n\nSince smartphone hardware is so similar, the home button experience can be a relatively transformative one.\n\nLike many Androids, Pixel has an onscreen home button flanked with back and recent app buttons. The iPhone has the most uniquely capacitive home button around: A solid-state button below the display with an integrated fingerprint sensor, varying levels of pressure sensitivity, and haptic feedback for a real-click feel.\n\nMobile payments\n\nBoth phones are NFC-equipped, so they can be outfitted with their respective software's mobile payment option.\n\nVirtual assistant\n\nIn addition to being the first Google-branded phone, Pixel is the first to have Google Assistant built-in. Assistant is an improved descendent of Google Now, and it seems to have a few advantages over Siri. For example, Assistant can better handle contextual queries and has useful additions like sending automatic responses and asking follow-up questions.\n\nOperating system\n\nWhile Apple pushes the latest software update onto all iPhones (and bricks a few in the process), not all Android phones receive software updates. No need to worry about that with the Pixel, though. As the first Google-branded phone on the market, it's going to showcase the latest and greatest Android software. Pixel launches with a brand-new 7.1 version of Android Nougat, and Google promises two years of OS upgrades and three years of security updates from launch.\n\nRelease\n\nGoogle announced the Pixel and Pixel XL just a few weeks after Apple released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.\n\nStarting price (full retail)\n\nThese two flagships are at the exact same price point, which makes them a little bit easier to weigh against each other.\n\nWhen all is said and done, these are two very similarly-equipped phones that promise solid hardware and a cohesive software experience. We'll have better intel once we delve into our full-length review of the Pixel, which we'll post in the coming weeks. In the meantime, you can read up about the iPhone 7 and iOS 10. We bet that Pixel vs. iPhone decisions will come down to either a personal preference on operating system or a hang-up about a particular hardware feature, like VR, water resistance, or the headphone jack.", "Google is one of the leading providers of artificial intelligence-assisted language translation, and the company now says a new technique for doing so is vastly improving the results. The company’s AI team calls it the Google Neural Machine Translation system, or GNMT, and it initially provided a less resource-intensive way to ingest a sentence in one language and produce that same sentence in another language. Instead of digesting each word or phrase as a standalone unit, as prior methods do, GNMT takes in the entire sentence as a whole.\n\n\"The advantage of this approach is that it requires fewer engineering design choices than previous Phrase-Based translation systems,\" writes Quoc V. Le and Mike Schuster, researchers on the Google Brain team. When the technique was first employed, it was able to match the accuracy of those existing translation systems. Over time, however, GNMT has proved capable of both producing superior results and working at the speed required of Google’s consumer apps and services. These improvements are detailed in a new paper published this week.\n\nIn some cases, Google says its GNMT system is even approaching human-level translation accuracy. That near-parity is restricted to transitions between related languages, like from English to Spanish and French. However, Google is eager to gather more data for \"notoriously difficult\" use cases, all of which will help its system learn and improve over time thanks to machine learning techniques. So starting today, Google is using its GNMT system for 100 percent of Chinese to English machine translations in the Google Translate mobile and web apps, accounting for around 18 million translations per day.\n\nGoogle admits that its approach still has a ways to go. \"GNMT can still make significant errors that a human translator would never make, like dropping words and mistranslating proper names or rare terms,\" Le and Schuster explain, \"and translating sentences in isolation rather than considering the context of the paragraph or page. There is still a lot of work we can do to serve our users better.\" But soon, as Google’s products and services continue vacuuming up valuable corner cases and rare phrasings, our phones may be capable of breaking down language barriers as effectively as a bilingual human being.", "Google Inc. signage is displayed on an office building inside the Googleplex headquarters in Mountain View, California, U.S., on Thursday, Feb. 18, 2016.\n\nGoogle Inc. signage is displayed on an office building inside the Googleplex headquarters in Mountain View, California, U.S., on Thursday, Feb. 18, 2016. Michael Short—Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nGoogle's Diversity Efforts Still Have a Long Way to Go\n\nGoogle's latest diversity statistics reveal the company is making steady but slow progress towards its goal of a more inclusive workplace, though white males still account for the overwhelming majority of its employees.\n\nGoogle says that 69% percent of its employees are now male, while 31% are female. That marks a small increase from the 70% to 30% ratio the company reported last year. But only 19% of Google's technical roles are held by women, while 81% of them are held by men. That's also a 1% increase compared to last year.\n\nGoogle has progressed slightly further when it comes to leadership roles: Women hold 24% of leadership positions in the company, up from 22%.\n\nThe company has made similar progress when it comes to ethnicity. 59% of Google employees are white, while 32% are Asian, 3% are Hispanic, and 2% are black. 70% percent of Google leadership roles and 57% of tech positions are held by white employees.\n\nIn a blog post, the search giant emphasized its efforts to hire more diverse employees, saying that the percentage of new hires that were black, Hispanic, and female in 2015 was actually higher than the company's current demographic representation for these groups. For example, 4% of Google's new hires last year were black, while only 2% of Google's total workforce is black.\n\nLast year, Google said it would spend $150 million in 2015 to promote diversity.\n\nCreating a diverse workforce has been a challenge for many major tech companies, including Apple , Facebook, and Yahoo, who have all reported similar gender and ethnic imbalances in the past.\n\nGoogle first began sharing its diversity statistics in 2014, triggering other Silicon Valley giants to do the same.\n\nTech corporations and startups have been vocal about closing the gap when it comes to diversity. 32 tech companies, including Airbnb, Spotify, Intel , Pinterest, and Lyft, have signed a pledge to make their workforce more representative and diverse.", "Google’s new Pixel phone comes with some impressive features. Its camera takes remarkable, detailed photos. It comes with Google Assistant, a virtual assistant tool that’s actually useful. The Pixel comes with some less obvious features worth exploring, too.\n\n\n\nFree Up Space Through a Quick Shortcut\n\nSome apps come with shortcuts. When you long press their icons from the home screen, you’ll get a list of quick actions for that app. Long press the Twitter icon, for example, and you have the option to search, write a new tweet, or send a message.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle Photos includes one of the most useful shortcuts, though. Long press the Photos icon, and you’ll see a shortcut to “free up space.” Hit that option and the app will find duplicate photos from your phone that are already saved on Google Photos. It will ask if you’d like to delete those photos since they’ve already been backed up.\n\nObviously, you can do this from the app itself, but this is a quick way to get there when you need some extra phone storage.\n\nCustomize Your Daily Briefing\n\n“My Day” is one of the most fun, useful features in Google Assistant. Launch the app with the voice command, “OK Google, tell me about my day,” and you’ll get a briefing of the weather, traffic, news, and more. Best of all, you can customize what kind of information you want to include in the briefing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom within Assistant, navigate to Settings > My Day and you can pick and choose what info you want: Weather, commute, meetings, and reminders. You can also customize your news sources by hitting the settings icon under News.\n\nGet New Wallpaper Every Day\n\nPixel’s live wallpapers not only look beautiful, some of them serve a practical purpose. Its horizon wallpaper, for example, shows a sunrise as your phone charges. When the battery fades, the sun goes down. You can also see a view of earth with real-time clouds, based on your location. (If you don’t have the Pixel, Google has an app for them for other Android devices)\n\n\n\nGoogle also includes a daily wallpapers feature that swap out your wallpaper image every 24 hours. To access these, head to Settings > Display > Wallpapers. If you choose Cityscapes, for example, you’ll see an option to turn on a daily wallpaper. Tap the box to set it up.\n\nTurn on the Notification Light\n\nPixel’s notification light is turned off by default so you might not even know it’s there. To turn it on, head to Settings > Notifications then hit the gear icon and turn on “pulse notification light.” Whenever you get a new notification, a light will now blink periodically next to the earpiece speaker.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSponsored\n\nThe light is subtle and it doesn’t blink often, though. You may want to turn it on as a gentle reminder that you have notifications waiting for you, especially if you have your phone set to silent or vibrate all other times.\n\nPlay Trivia With Assistant\n\nOkay, this isn’t the most useful feature, but hey, it’s kind of fun. If you ask Google Assistant to “play Lucky Trivia,” it’ll launch a quick game of trivia with five questions. You can play alone or with multiple contestants. It asks a series of random questions like the one above, and you respond by voice. The questions are pretty easy, but if you have kids, this might be a fun feature for them.\n\n\n\nAccess Split Screen Mode\n\nFor apps that support it (and even on many that don’t), you can use split screen on the Pixel phone, too. To access split screen mode, open the apps you want to split. From within one of the apps, hold down the square menu button and your phone’s screen will split in half. From there, you can choose which second app you want in the bottom half of your screen.\n\n\n\nWhen you’re in split screen mode, the square button aptly turns into two rectangle icons. To swap out the bottom screen app, hit this split screen icon. To exit split screen, hold down on the icon.\n\nAvoid and Block Spam Calls\n\nWhenever I get an unknown call, I immediately Google the number to see where it’s coming from. It could be UPS calling me about a package or it could be some spammer wasting my time. You probably do the same song and dance. Pixel makes it easier to screen calls with its Caller ID & Spam feature.\n\n\n\nTurn on this feature from within the dialer Settings. This way, when you get a call, you’ll get as much info as possible about the caller. You can also block these numbers from Google Dialer.\n\nAutomatically (and Securely) Connect to Open Wi-Fi Networks\n\nGoogle’s Wi-Fi assistant comes in handy when you want to save on data. It automatically connects to open Wi-Fi networks when they’re available. It only connects to high-quality networks and secures your data via a VPN. When you’re connected, a key icon appears in your status bar.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis feature is disabled by default. To turn it on, head to Settings > Wi-Fi, then hit the gear icon and turn on “use open Wi-Fi automatically.”\n\nEnable Night Light\n\nLess blue light before bed is a good thing. Pixel’s Night Light feature turns your screen tint from blue to red at night, kind of like f.lux can, but without the need to root your phone or use an app. Theoretically, less blue night at light helps you sleep better.\n\n\n\nAccess Night Light from Settings > Display > Night Light. You can set it to turn off and on automatically from sunset to sunrise, or you can schedule it for specific times of the day.\n\nGet Information Related to What’s Currently on Screen\n\nGoogle Assistant will tell you all the interesting things it can do when you have the app open, much like Google Now On Tap used to on older devices. You can also use it from within other apps, though. Depending on what’s on your screen, Assistant can offer extra information. If you’re reading an article, for example, launch Assistant by saying “OK Google,” and you can swipe up on Assistant to see suggestions for further reading or more information on a specific topic.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPixel already comes with a surplus of practical settings, so it’s easy to glaze over some of the more obscure features it comes with. Best of all, some of these features are already available on Nexus, or they will be, with Android 7.1.1.", "3:02 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF\n\nDon't get me wrong: Google Maps is the king of the online mapping industry, but that doesn't mean that the Google Maps app is the best navigation app for your Android phone. There are plenty of other navigation apps on the market, and most of them are just as speedy and accurate as Google Maps (some are more so). Google Maps is a good general maps app, but if you commute all day long or you primarily use public transit, it may not be the best app for you.\n\nHere are five other Android navigation apps you might want to check out:\n\nWaze\n\nWaze is technically owned by Google, but this \"social\" navigation app is completely separate from Google Maps. While Google Maps is a general navigation app, Waze is driving-focused, which means it offers some cool features like user-reported gas prices and turn-by-turn directions to parking lots near your destination. The app also has a robust community of users, and it uses this community to gather real-time traffic data and user-reported incidents, such as accidents, road closures, speed cameras and police traps.\n\nIf you're looking for a friendly driving community that's committed to keeping the public informed about upcoming speed traps, Waze is the app for you. This app is all about social networking, so you can also plan trips with friends, sync events from your phone's calendar as well as your Facebook account and see the ETAs of friends who are traveling to the same place as you are.\n\nEnlarge Image Sarah Jacobsson Purewal/CNET\n\nHere WeGo\n\nHere WeGo (which was originally developed for the Windows Phone platform by Nokia) is a free app that offers turn-by-turn directions for drivers, pedestrians, cyclists and public transit riders. The app also features real-time traffic information, nearby points of interest, the ability to share your location (or the location of a point of interest) with friends and family members and offline map downloads for when you don't have a data connection.\n\nHere WeGo offers just about everything Google Maps does, and a little more. The cycling directions and the public transportation overlays are useful, and the app's points of interest system is also pretty strong (the app pulls info from places like Wikipedia, TripAdvisor, BlaBlaCar, Expedia, Car2go and GetYourGuide).\n\nMoovit\n\nIf you take public transportation frequently, you've probably noticed that Google Maps' directions are very basic. Moovit is a free, dedicated transit app that offers several features you won't find in Google Maps, such as step-by-step directions that will tell you how many stops you have left and alert you when it's time to get off the bus, train or ferry you're riding. Moovit also features an entire section dedicated to information about delays, maintenance and service interruptions. It also links you to the local transit agencies' Twitter accounts, so you can really feel like a local.\n\nEnlarge Image Sarah Jacobsson Purewal/CNET\n\nGoogle Maps' public transit directions will work in a pinch, but Moovit -- which is available in 1,200 cities around the world (including over 100 cities in the US) -- is the app you need to really understand the local metro system. The app has even started integrating information about local bike shares in select cities.\n\nBackCountry Nav Topo Maps GPS\n\nIf Moovit is for urban city-dwellers, BackCountry Nav Topo Maps GPS -- which costs $12 (roughly converting to £10 in the UK and AU$15 in Australia) but offers a 21-day free trial -- is for the opposite. BackCountry Nav Topo Maps GPS is an offline navigation app designed for people who are trekking through the wilderness. This app offers a variety of maps available for users to download, including topographic maps, marine maps and aviation maps. The app also has street maps (through OpenStreetMap and Bing World Street Maps) available, though its primary purpose is for navigating non-street areas.\n\nEnlarge Image Sarah Jacobsson Purewal/CNET\n\nOther navigation apps (including Google Maps) understand the value of downloadable, offline maps, but most of those apps do not pay much attention to topography or navigation outside of cities and suburban areas. BackCountry Nav Topo Maps GPS is the app you'll need for those ultra-outdoorsy activities, though.\n\nMaps.me\n\nMaps.me is a free navigation app that focuses on offline navigation. This app lets you download entire cities (or, well, parts of cities) at a time for when you need to save data or you do not have internet access. Maps.me uses OpenStreetMap for its offline maps (but, unlike BackCountry Nav Topo Maps GPS, Maps.Me is completely free). The app offers turn-by-turn directions and a comprehensive list of points of interest -- including overlays for nearby places with Wi-Fi and toilets -- but does not offer real-time traffic information since it is, after all, an offline app.\n\nMaps.me is a handy app when you don't have internet, and, unlike some of the other apps that offers offline maps as an afterthought, Maps.me makes downloading apps quick and easy.", "For those of you who grew up with Harry Potter, your childhood dream of being a witch or wizard just got a lot closer. We may not live in J.K. Rowling's magical universe, but technology from is bringing us the next best thing--the ability to cast spells using an Android phone.\n\nThree new Harry Potter spells are now available on Android: Lumos, Nox and Silencio. Say, \"Okay Google, Lumos\" to light up your phone's flashlight. Then \"Okay Google, Nox\" to turn it off when you're done. And \"Okay Google, Silencio\" turns off your phone's volume.\n\nGoogle announced the new feature on its blog on Tuesday morning. While Daydream View ($79) and its Harry Potter-themed game Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them aren't available until November, Google's new spells feature is clearly hyping the game and aimed at getting users excited about exploring the Harry Potter world with Google's hardware.\n\nGoogle also announced four new sites in Google Street View that let you explore the fictional world of Fantastic Beasts, which is set in New York in 1926. It's a pretty cool sneak peek into the game before it makes its way into the hands of consumers.\n\n\"When we had Harry Potter, none of this technology existed,\" Blair Rich, president of worldwide marketing for Warner Bros., told Fast Company. \"So to be able to creatively interpret this world through technology and allow people this very unusual kind of interaction with it, is really a marketing plus.\"\n\nWhile Google is late in the game on consumer VR and voice commands, it's appealing to Millennial consumers with all these new Harry Potter features. Now, it just needs to figure out how to cast the Avada Kedavra spell on its competitors.", "Google has taken on Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Microsoft Cortana with its own voice assistant: Google Assistant.\n\nGoogle first unveiled Assistant at Google I/O in May 2016, launched it on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones, brought it to Google Home - which will be available in the UK from 6 April - and then Android Wear 2.0. Now it's all set for a wider roll-out to all devices with Google's Nougat operating system, so will be coming to a lot more phones.\n\nHere's how Google Assistant works, which devices it is available on, and when you'll be able to use it.\n\nGoogle Assistant is Google's latest iteration of an assistant. It's considered an upgrade or an extension of Google Now - designed to be personal - as well as an expansion of Google's existing \"OK Google\" voice controls.\n\nFor anyone who has been using an Android device for some time, you'll know that the Google Now feature smartly pulls out relevant information for you. It knows where you work, and it knows your meeting locations and travel plans, the sports teams you like, and what interests you. This data is presented to you in cards and through reminders on your Android device.\n\nThe \"OK Google\" or \"Hey, Google\" side covers voice commands, voice searching, and voice-activated device control, letting you do things like send messages, check appointments and so on on your Android device, just like Apple's Siri on an iPhone or iPad. Google Assistant fuses all this together with a new bot-centric AI experience, designed to give you conversational interactions that cover both these areas and more.\n\nGoogle Assistant launched on the Google Pixel smartphones and Google Home. A limited version also saw early release in the Google Allo app. It is coming to Android Wear devices via Android Wear 2.0, and Google has confirmed it will be made available for Android TV (both televisions and set-top boxes) as well as in some cars.\n\nOriginally Google said Assistant would be exclusive to the Pixel phones - but this position has changed, with the company confirming on 26 February 2017 that it would be coming to a wider range of handsets running Marshmallow or Nougat.\n\nHowever, the full Google Assistant experience is deeply integrated into the Pixel devices, and it is very different to the iteration in Allo, which is limited by comparison - as we'll discuss below. We expect Google to have Google Assistant on all Android, Android Wear, and Android Auto devices before too long though.\n\nThe Google Pixel phones launched in the US in October 2016, with Google Assistant baked to the core, so they're good to go.\n\nGoogle has confirmed it will begin rolling out an update the week of 26 February for Android 7.0 Nougat and 6.0 Marshmallow phones.\n\nThe update will bring Google Assistant to compatible phones in the US will be the first to update, with the UK, Australia, Canada and Germany following soon after.\n\nThe phones that will get Google Assistant include:\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 edge\n\nHTC 10\n\nHTC U Ultra\n\nLG G5\n\nLG V20\n\nSony Xperia XZ\n\nHuawei P9\n\nplus many more\n\nGoogle hasn't officially confirmed the device list for the Google Assistant upgrade, but it comes as part of a Google Play Services update for devices running Android Nougat and Android Marshmallow, meaning that many phones should be supported.\n\nGoogle Assistant will support English, as well as the German, and Google has said it will roll out support for more languages throughout 2017. The roll-out is expected to begin from 2 March 2017.\n\nGoogle Home with built-in, voice-activated Google Assistant launched in the US in November 2016.\n\nHome will arrive in the UK on 6 April, along with its UK-accented version of Google Assistant.\n\nGoogle's long-awaited Android Wear 2.0 update gives you Google Assistant. Unfortunately, AW 2.0 won't be available for every Android Wear smartwatch. Older devices like the original Moto 360 and the LG G Watch aren't compatible, for example.\n\nKeep in mind LG has designed the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style in collaboration with Google - and these are the launch devices for Android Wear 2.0. The LG Watch Sport and Style will be available from 10 February 2017 in the US and will be coming to other regions soon after.\n\nWhile making an announcement at CES 2017 in January, Google confirmed Google Assistant is coming to Android TV-compatible televisions and set-top boxes. Your Sony Bravia TV will get an update allowing you access to Google Assistant on your TV, and Google said you can expect the update sometime in \"the coming months\".\n\nHowever, Google has confirmed that the £190 new Nvidia Shield TV (pending a forthcoming software update) will be the first to give you the full hands-free Google Assistant experience. And, just like Google Home, Nvidia's Shield Spot - a Wi-Fi-connected microphone/speaker peripheral that can be placed anywhere and connect to your Shield Android TV over Wi-Fi - will be one of the first devices to spread Google Assistant around your home (a little like the Amazon Echo Dot). Nvidia hasn't yet announced a launch date for Spot.\n\nGoogle has confirmed that Google Assistant is also going to be available in some cars. Currently, this appears to be through compatible Android-powered in-car infotainment systems, but the company made no specific mention of Android Auto, nor did it announce a rollout date.\n\nYou can now use Google Assistant in the Google Allo app.\n\nTo check if your phone has Google Assistant, say \"Ok Google\", \"Hey, Google\", or press-and-hold the home button.\n\nOn Marshmallow or Nougat devices that have had the update, that long press will launch Google Assistant, popping up with a page asking how it can help, as pictured below.\n\nThat's the starting point for Google Assistant, after which you can type or speak questions and have Assistant respond.\n\nThe thing to remember about Google Assistant is that it is designed to be conversational. That means you can ask a question and then ask several follow-up questions, and Google Assistant will be able to keep track of the conversation, determine context, and audibly respond with the right information. You do need to preface each with the \"OK Google\" or \"Hey, Google\" wake-up, but it'll remember a string of questions, contextually too. Here's how Google Assistant works across the different Google devices.\n\nWith Google Assistant baked deep into the new Pixel smartphones, it's no surprise to find that there's instant access from the home button. Where this home button would once give you Now on Tap with a long press, that's now replaced by Google Assistant.\n\nLong press on the home button and you enter the Google Assistant interface. This looks a lot like OK Google and can be triggered with the same hot word, with listening bars picking up your voice and instantly transcribing what you say onto the screen. You are then delivered a spoken reply, with results returned on the screen too. You can speak or tap your selections and the conversation continues.\n\nFor example, you can ask what you should have for dinner, and Google Assistant will locate local places to eat and serve up suggestions, with cards for a selection of restaurants. Google has further demonstrated this example by then booking a table using OpenTable.\n\nGoogle Assistant also takes over things like navigation. Say you want to navigate home - as you would with OK Google - that still works, but you can also ask to find coffee shops on the way, for example.\n\nThings run much deeper, though. You can ask what your next flight is, when your trip is, and you can ask to watch a particular programme on Netflix, or you can ask to view dog photos from your collection. There's also a wide range of fun options, like games, with a full panel show game hidden behind the \"I'm feeling lucky\" command.\n\nOur experience so far suggests that Google Assistant is going to be huge and as it stands, it's a long way ahead of Siri, Alexa or Cortana.\n\nGoogle Home is a connected speaker that also works as a smarthome control center and an assistant for the whole family. You can use it to playback entertainment throughout your entire home, effortlessly manage everyday tasks, and ask Google what you want to know. Google Home is able to do much of these things thanks to Google Assistant, working in a similar way to Alexa on Amazon's Echo.\n\nThe idea behind Google Home, however, is to be more integrated into your home environment. The Google Assistant is access with the \"OK Google\" hot word, or by tapping on the top of the Home device. Smarthome support comes in the form of IFTTT, Nest, Hue, SmartThings, so you'll be able to speak commands, as well as Chromecast support, meaning you can just speak to watch Netflix on your TV, which is really clever.\n\nLike Amazon's Alexa, you can ask almost anything - weights, measures, check your schedule, book an Uber, and more. Where this would all be phone-centric in the past, Google Assistant makes it easier to do all of this stuff through Google Home, just by using your voice.\n\nA lot of the original Android Wear experience relied on voice control. With Android Wear 2.0, the whole platform is now better equipped to deal with alternative inputs, like the swipe keyboard, as well as voice. Google Assistant is now available to better service your commands and demands. It can hold contextual conversations to deliver the information you want, as well as take other actions.\n\nFor example, you'll be able to ask Google to find an restaurant and navigate you there. In addition to a microphone, you'll also be able to hear replies through the watch's speaker (if supported by hardware). Best of all, Google Assistant works in English and German, with more languages coming soon. The LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style are the launch devices for Android Wear 2.0, and, unfortunately, the update won't be made available for every Android Wear smartwatch, especially the older ones like the original Moto 360.\n\nThe Google Assistant you get with Android Wear 2.0 is a lot like what you find in the Pixel phones and Google Home. On the LG Watch Style, you can call upon Google Assistant by holding down the exterior crown. Assistant will ask you how it can help. You can use it do a range of tasks - such as a quick conversion for foreign exchange rates, or sending a message, or tracking your run or to launch an app.\n\nAnd, if you're watching TV via Chromecast, you can use your Android Wear 2.0 watch a remote of sorts. Assistant will let you control any compatible smart home device - from Samsung Smart Things to Nest. What you can't do seems to be hit or miss. For instance, you can't call an Uber through Assistant on the watch like you can through Google Home. You also can't get Spotify to play a specific playlist.\n\nThe full integration of Google Assistant is coming to Android TV-compatible televisions and set-top boxes.\n\nPending a forthcoming software update, it will enable the new Nvidia Shield TV to be controlled almost entirely by voice, and Samsung SmartThings support will add the ability to control smart devices around the house. It will effectively turn your Shield into a Google Home or Amazon Echo, albeit one that plays media through a TV rather than speaker and has the ability to bring up on-screen results.\n\nWe've seen it work with a Nest thermostat, coffee maker and lighting in an early demo, so it's an excellent addition when it comes. Nvidia chose to use the game controller as the mic, however, so you do need to leave it lying around within earshot. Nvidia told us that was necessary. Putting the mic in the Shield TV box meant that it would have to be proudly displayed instead.\n\nWe will update this piece with more details when the new Nvidia Shield TV and other Android TV devices get Google Assistant.\n\nAllo is Google's new smart chat app.\n\nThe messenger has started its roll out on Android and iOS and is designed to give you plenty of options when it comes to chatting to your friends. Rather than just giving you a straight-down-the-line messaging app, Allo makes chat more fun and interactive. It's based on your phone number - like WhatsApp - and seems to be going after all the popular chat apps, with emoji, stickers, and more.\n\nOne of its hottest features in the app is Google Assistant. Google took the voice assistant, as well as bots like the ones found in Facebook Messenger, and rolled them all into one product. In Allo, you can to ask Google Assistant questions by either typing \"@google\" and then asking your question or by using your voice to dictate.\n\nGoogle Assistant will serve up results for or responses to your questions in Allo. Again, this is all conversational, so you can ask follow-up questions and the clever bot remains contextually aware. You can ask anything you'd type in to Google Search or Maps, including asking it to find you a place to eat nearby or how many euros are in a number of pounds. You can interact with it by asking it to tell you something interesting, show you something funny, or show a video about something specific, and it all shows up within the chat you're in. You don't need to leave the app.\n\nOne of the cool features is the in-chat game. Type \"@google let's play a game\" and you'll get the option to play emoji based trivia games. The app also features an incognito mode so that you can make your conversations more private, and you can even set them to self-destruct within a specified amount of time.", "Over the past seven days, the agricultural hub of the state has searched for immigration-related topics more than any other area of the country, according to Google Trends.\n\nAfter the Trump administration released new rules related to immigration and border enforcement, interest in the subject of immigration surged on Google, with searches from Yakima and the Tri-Cities ranking among the highest in the country.\n\nNationwide, searches involving the word “immigration” peaked Tuesday evening on Google after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s release of two memos outlining how it would carry out two executive orders signed by President Trump last month.\n\nThose orders — separate from the “travel ban” entangled in federal court — directed the “immediate construction of a physical wall” on the U.S.-Mexico border, and the hiring of 15,000 more federal employees to patrol the border and conduct deportations. They also called for denying federal funds to “sanctuary cities” such as Seattle, and spelled out new rules allowing federal agents to seek deportation of undocumented immigrants who have been convicted of a crime.\n\nSearches from Yakima, Pasco, Kennewick and Richland ranked first in the nation over the past seven days, according to Google Trends. The region is the state’s agricultural hub and has a sizable Latino population.\n\nThe area remained high in the search rankings through Friday morning, fluctuating with the news of immigration raids in other states, including Mississippi.\n\nThe new Homeland Security rules have generated concern statewide, said Jorge Barón, executive director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project in Seattle.\n\n“We are seeing mostly fear,’’ Barón said. “For instance, in the Seattle office, around the same time period last year, we were averaging 600, 700 calls per day. We’re now experiencing, the last couple of days, 1,300 calls per day.”\n\nThe calls are coming “directly from impacted community members, and also other folks in the community who are concerned about people that they know or people they work with,’’ Barón said. “We’re hearing from schools, health-care providers — they’re all trying to figure out what they can do to protect clients and people they work with.”\n\nBarón said some of the searches could be driven by local news, particularly if there was coverage of enforcement actions by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, and by an uncertain political climate east of the Cascades.\n\n“There’s a heightened level of concern in Eastern Washington because they’re not hearing the same things that people in Western Washington are hearing from their political leaders,’’ he said.\n\nBarón said he spoke with the top attorney in the project’s Granger office, and learned that immigrants there “feel the rest of the community is in favor of enforcement, unlike Seattle where you see protests and support.”\n\nSeattle Mayor Ed Murray has been adamant about protecting undocumented immigrants in the community and preserving Seattle’s status as a “sanctuary city.”\n\nIn January, the mayor said he is preparing to lose “every penny” of the tens of millions of dollars the federal government sends the city each year.\n\n“This city will not be bullied by this administration into abandoning our core values, and we believe we have the rule of law and the courts on our side,” the mayor said at the time.\n\nAmong the top immigration questions being searched on Google nationally:\n\n• What is an immigrant?\n\n• What is the latest immigration news?\n\n• What are the new immigration laws?\n\n• Do “illegal immigrants” pay taxes?\n\n• What are undocumented immigrants?", "Panoramio, the location-centric photo sharing service Google acquired in 2007, will show its last image on November 4. For the longest time, Google used Panoramio to augment its Google Maps and Google Earth services with crowdsourced imagery. Now that the company has integrated photo uploads into the Google Maps mobile apps and launched its Local Guides program, Panoramio clearly isn’t a priority for the company anymore.\n\nGoogle previously tried to shut the service down in 2014. At the time, its users successfully petitioned the company to keep it open, but this time around, the decision seems to be final.\n\n“Today, with photo upload tools in Google Maps and our Local Guides program, we are providing easy options for you to share your photos with an active and growing community,” Google wrote in an email to Panoramio users today. “As such, we’ve decided to now close down Panoramio.”\n\nLast year, when Google decided to keep the service going beyond its original closing date, the company said that it would go “back to the drawing board to work on a more integrated solution that supports you and your content directly within Google Maps.” Today, Google is encouraging active Panoramio users to join its Local Guides program and to upload photos directly to Google Maps.\n\nFor users who have linked their Panoramio and Google+ accounts, Google will automatically copy their images to a Google Album archive (that’s Google service for downloading copies of images from all of its services). Users will also still be able to access their photos in Panoramio for a year after November 4.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Panoramio’s users aren’t impressed, but today’s incarnation of Google/Alphabet isn’t shy about shutting down services that have outlived their usefulness. Sadly, that’s also true for Panoramio, even if there’s still a small but lively community on the service.", "With minimal dialogue and graceful editing, Mr. Davis and the screenwriter Luke Davies convey the Dickensian dimensions of Saroo’s situation. He is small and vulnerable, but also smart and resourceful, and even as he is exposed to horrifying cruelty, he is also a hero on an adventure. The enormous pain of his loss is sometimes mitigated by the excitement of discovery. You fear for him, and also root for him, and mostly you are captivated by his story and the sophisticated simplicity of its telling.\n\nWhat happens in the second part of the movie is a little more complicated. Saroo (now played by Dev Patel) has grown to manhood as the adopted son of an Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). He has a brother, Mantosh (Divian Ladwa), who was also adopted from India and has mental health and substance-abuse problems. Despite that, Saroo seems to be living in the happily-ever-after stage of the fairy tale. He moves to Melbourne to study hotel management and falls in love with a fellow student, Lucy (Rooney Mara), from America.\n\nVideo\n\nBut memories of his long-ago life haunt him, and the arrival of new technology raises the tantalizing possibility of a return to his first home. Using Google Earth, Saroo sets out to retrace, on the computer screen and on sheets of paper tacked to his bedroom wall, his accidental journey. It’s not a fast or easy process, and the effort takes an emotional toll on him, on his parents and on Lucy. But you know, even if you’re not familiar with the true story behind “Lion,” that the fairy tale will come true.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Davis, with strong assistance from a cast of dignified, charismatic criers and the music of Hauschka and Dustin O’Halloran, floods the viewer with big feelings. If you have ever been a child, raised a child, lost a child or met a child — or a mother — this movie will wreck you. As a purely emotional experience it succeeds without feeling too manipulative or maudlin. I mean, it is manipulative and maudlin, but in a way that seems fair and transparent.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, it isn’t quite satisfying. The transition from the young to the grown-up Saroo demands a shift in tone and genre that “Lion” doesn’t quite achieve. What felt in the first part like wonderful, Spielbergian simplicity feels, in the latter sections, like simplification. There isn’t enough of the rough texture of family life or the complications of young love to give the older Saroo a full identity. The movie hovers on the edge of going deeper into his psychological predicament but holds itself back.\n\nAt the end, the focus shifts from the agonies of Saroo to the glories of Google. I can’t complain too much about that; for all I know, Google brought you to this review. But I also can’t help feeling a dystopian chill amid all the warm don’t-be-evil fuzzies, a hint of corporate propaganda behind the fable. It is indeed remarkable how small the world has become, how many problems data can solve, how connected we all are to one another. But we’ve lost something, too, and we can’t even see what it is.\n\n“Lion” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for sex and profanity. Running time: 1 hour 59 minutes.", "Photo\n\nLove was in the air at President-elect Donald J. Trump’s summit meeting last week with tech executives. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, was really feeling it, coming as it did a day after the company announced that its self-driving technology was ready for commercialization. The meeting was a giant green light for an industry and the multitrillion-dollar investment it will represent, the cost largely to be borne by consumers and government.\n\nAutomobile, telecom, tech and e-commerce industries, and their marketers, have spent the last decade enabling the public’s addiction to wired living, working feverishly to bring the phone and the internet into the driving environment. And yet this trend has never been voted on or discussed seriously by our politicians. Even when the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation brought industry leaders to Washington for hearings last spring, congressional interlocutors sought mainly to have their guests tell them how government could help usher in this new age of driverless technology. The assumption was: game on.\n\nIn the glorious future, we are assured that driverless cars will save lives, reduce accidents, ease congestion, curb energy consumption and lower harmful emissions. These purported benefits contain elements of truth. But the data is nowhere near complete. Even stipulating that all the claimed benefits will one day materialize, the near- and midterm picture from a public-interest perspective is not the same favorable one that industry sees. Legitimate areas of question and concern remain.\n\nTake, for instance, the “safety” benefits of self-driving cars that include avoiding tens of thousands of highway deaths each year. The truth is, no one knows for sure how many lives could be saved by driverless cars, because data on the role of human error in crashes is incomplete and misleading, relying heavily on self-reporting. The types of accidents we’ll face in this automated future, in which these cars are meant to run together in proximity at high speed, may be fewer, but they’ll be new, different, unpredictable and, on occasion, larger and more grisly than the ones we know today.

Drawing one doesn't take long and could help you figure out the next project, hobby or career change that will make the new year happier and more successful, Blake says.\n\n\n\n\"My favorite way to brainstorm creatively, whether it's about values or setting goals for the new year, is through mind maps,\" Blake tells CNBC.", "Google's Go was 2016's programming language of the year, says the TIOBE Index, a highly-regarded resource for ranking the popularity of programming languages.\n\nWhile the TIOBE Index only catalogues the relative popularity of programming languages via search engines, not how often they're actually used in real life, it's a handy tool for figuring out what skills to learn if you're chasing a career in technology.\n\nEvery year, this award goes to \"the programming language that has gained the most popularity in a year.\" And \"without hardly any competition Go has won the award for 2016,\" TIOBE writes. Plus, TIOBE says that among its paying customers, it's seeing more interest in Go in industrial settings.\n\nSince 2009, Google has been overseeing the community-led development of Go — a programming language aimed at helping web developers build apps at Google's scale and Google's speed, with a focus on rock-solid performance and ease of use, rather than chasing after the latest fads in programming.\n\nGo has won its fair share of fans in programmer-land, not least because it provides a viable alternative to Oracle's Java, which has ruled the world of computer programming for the last two decades. Google's been using Go internally to power things like its download servers, where you grab stuff like the Chrome install files.\n\nLanguages to watch in 2017\n\nThe runner-ups for programming language of the year, per TIOBE, were Dart (another Google-led programming language, incidentally) and Perl, a NASA-created language renowned for its reliability, if not its elegance.\n\nOther movers and shakers on the list include Facebook's Hack, which shot up to 51st place on the list from 67 in 2015, and Julia, a language that shot up from 73rd to 52nd place.\n\nThe TIOBE Index expects that in 2017, the favored candidates for programming language of the year will include Apple's Swift, Julia, the Microsoft'created TypeScript, and the ever-popular C++.\n\nIncidentally, back in August 2016, the C programming language —the legendary programming language invented in 1972 and still widely used — recorded its lowest-ever score on the TIOBE Index since its creation in 2001. It looks like C finished 2016 with a lower score still, showing signs of fading even as its offshoot C++ gains on it quickly.\n\nGet the latest Google stock price here.", "Autonomous Lexus SUV could not prevent accident that caved in front and rear passenger-side doors, setting off airbags and forcing it to be towed away\n\nOne of Google’s self-driving cars was involved in one of the worst autonomous vehicle accident yet, when a driver ran a red light and collided with the passenger side door of the modified Lexus SUV.\n\nThe driver of the vehicle passed through a red light as one of Google’s fleet of autonomous Lexus SUVs passed through a green light on Friday afternoon. The collision, which occurred at the intersection between El Camino Rea and Phyllis Ave in Mountain View, California, caused the Google car’s airbags to be deployed, and caved in its front and rear right-side doors.\n\nMountain View police said that no injuries were reported, but the Google car had to be towed away on a flatbed truck.\n\nRon van Zuylen (@grommet) @davidnield permission granted. pic.twitter.com/WyKFCJE2Vz\n\nGoogle’s autonomous vehicles are no stranger to accidents, suffering multiple impacts with various vehicles. Mostly they’ve been rear-ended when either driving slowly or stationary at a junction, suffering minor damage. The side impact in this most recent accident is one of only a few that have caused major damage to the expensive test vehicles.\n\nGoogle said that the car was in self-driving mode with a person sitting at the steering wheel. The Google car hit the brakes automatically on seeing the other car crossing the red light, followed by the human behind the wheel doing the same, but it wasn’t enough to prevent the collision.\n\nJames Allen, who happened upon the crash, told KBCW: “I’ve never seen one in an accident and I see at least 30 to 40 a day.

It's about the size of two hockey pucks stacked together.\n\nThis is the first Wi-Fi router -- or router system -- made by Google and like the Eero it comes in three identical units. You only need one if you live in a small apartment, but the point of the extra two is to blanket a large home with a Wi-Fi signal. Previously, Google made the software for its OnHub routers, but the hardware was handled by TP-Link and Asus.\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nGoogle says the new Google Wifi system has a built-in Network Assist feature set that uses logic to optimize the connection, allowing Wi-Fi devices, like smartphones and tablets, to automatically connect to the closest unit and on the best channel at a given time. This means you can walk around the house without worrying about getting disconnected or even losing signal strength.\n\nSince your devices aren't smart enough to do that themselves, Google says the software simply forces your device off one access point, and automatically provides the login information for another.\n\nWhat's more, the system includes a free mobile app with built-in parental control, allowing you to pause (and resume) the internet connection to any connected device at anytime. Some of these features will come to the existing OnHub router in a software update, says Google.\n\nAs far as tech specs, the Google Wifi offers a dual-band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) 802.11ac wireless connection, and one extra Ethernet port for a wired device. Instead of a proprietary power adapter, it plugs into the wall with a standard USB-C charge cable.\n\nThe best thing about the Google Wifi is its price, which is $129 for a single unit or $299 for a set of three. This is much less than the Eero, which costs $200 for a single unit or $500 for three. (The price for the UK and Australia have not yet been announced.)\n\nYou do have to wait until early December to get your own, however, but you can start preordering the Google Wifi starting in November. Check back then for its full review.\n\nAdditional reporting by Sean Hollister.", "4K TVs are getting cheaper every day, and now 4K-capable devices to connect to those TVs are following suit. One of the cheapest so far is Chromecast Ultra.\n\nThis tiny device, available for $69, AU$99 or £69 in November, promises better image quality than the current $35 Chromecast. That's because it can stream 4K and HDR video.\n\nAt launch Google says Chromecast Ultra will stream 4K from Netflix, YouTube and Vudu. Coming later this year, Google's own Play TV and Movies store will also offer 4K video. Google hasn't yet confirmed the exact date or which, if any, of these services will stream HDR to the Chromecast Ultra at launch, but its blog post says \"we're working to bring more 4K and HDR content on board.\"\n\nIn theory 4K resolution provides a sharper picture than 1080p HD video, but in CNET's tests the difference is subtle at best with Netflix and other streaming sources. HDR, aka high dynamic range, can provide a more dramatic improvement in contrast and color, depending on the video in question. Just don't confuse it with HDR for phones (even Pixel phones with HDR+).\n\nEnlarge Image James Martin/CNET\n\nNotably the Ultra is the first external streaming device to handle both HDR formats, HDR10 and Dolby Vision. Other HDR devices, including the $200 Nvidia Shield, the $100 Roku Premiere+ and the $70 Xiaomi Mi Box, are all HDR10-only. In our tests we've found that with TVs that do support Dolby Vision, the image is slightly superior to HDR10.\n\nOf course, to get the benefits of 4K or HDR (in either format) you'll need a compatible TV. You'll also need to be watching a 4K and/or HDR TV stream, which are still restricted to a just a few shows, videos and movies. Such higher-quality streams require good bandwidth -- 15Mbps or higher for Netflix, for example -- and you'll need to subscribe to Netflix's $15 monthly plan to get access.\n\nAside from 4K and HDR, the Ultra is very similar to the current Chromecast, except that it's only available in black. Both are tiny pucks with integrated HDMI cables designed to hang out of sight behind your TV.\n\nOne difference is the inclusion of an Ethernet port for wired internet, housed on the power adapter of the Ultra. That's a nice addition given the higher bandwidth requirements of 4K video. You can buy a similar $15 adapter to add Ethernet to standard Chromecast, and both offer 801.11ac Wi-Fi.\n\nGoogle also calls Ultra \"the fastest Chromecast yet,\" claiming streams start 1.8 times faster than the current version.\n\nBoth devices work with Google Home, the company's new smart speaker with built-in voice assistant. You can command the speaker to turn on the TV and switch its input to Chromecast, then ask for certain YouTube content by name. One example Google gives is saying \"\"Ok, Google, play the Jungle Book trailer on my TV.\"\n\nIf you don't own a Home, Chromecast requires you to use your phone, tablet or PC to \"Cast\" video from supported apps to the TV. The system is quite versatile and reliable in our tests, and app support is superb. One exception, however, is Amazon video. That popular service doesn't work with the Cast system, so Chromecast can't deliver its videos, which include a relatively large collection of 4K and HDR TV shows and movies.\n\nIn the past we've preferred Roku devices to Chromecast because they do support Amazon, and also offer an actual remote that we find more convenient to use than a phone. Roku's least expensive player with 4K and HDR is the $100 Premiere+, and for Google (and Kodi) fans the Android-powered $70 Xiaomi Mi Box (which can also Cast, and includes an actual remote) is an intriguing alternative. We look forward to comparing it to Chromecast Ultra as soon as we get our hands on review samples.\n\nIn the meantime, our review of the current Chromecast and the accompanying video (below) have some more details about how the device works.\n\n2:27 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF\n\nArticle updated October 6th with additional details about 4K and HDR support and Google Home.", "Google parent company Alphabet just made a big move to bring its self-driving car tech to market cheaper and faster.\n\nAlphabet-owned company Waymo has slashed the price of lidar, a key component of self-driving cars that helps them see the world, by 90%, Waymo CEO John Krafcik said during a keynote address to kick off the Detroit Auto Show on Sunday.\n\nLidar is the most expensive component of self-driving cars. As Krafcik noted in his address, a single unit cost $75,000 just a few years ago. A lidar sensor is attached to the top of a car where it spins and shoots out lasers to create high-resolution maps of the car's surroundings.\n\n\"Just a few years ago, a single top-of-the-range lidar cost upwards of $75,000. Today, we’ve brought down that cost by more than 90%,\" Krafcik said. \"As we look to scale, we will do even better, with the goal of making this technology accessible to millions of people.\"\n\nWaymo is also building all of its self-driving car hardware in-house to ensure that it can scale, Krafcik said.\n\nIf Waymo has indeed managed to reduce that top-range lidar cost by more than 90%, the company is looking at a price of roughly $7,500 per sensor. Waymo originally used lidar manufactured by Velodyne in its early prototype cars.\n\nSince its collaboration with Waymo, Velodyne has reduced the price of its lidar to range from $8,000 to $30,000, depending on how many lasers it shoots out. Ford and China-based internet company Baidu have both invested $150 million in Velodyne for their self-driving car efforts.\n\nGoogle began hiring mechanical engineers to develop \"novel lidar systems\" in December 2015, marking a departure with Velodyne.\n\nBuilding self-driving technology to scale\n\nWaymo is making serious moves to bring its self-driving cars to market. Waymo is an independent company operating under Alphabet, Google's parent company, as of December.\n\nThe tech giant has also partnered with Fiat Chrysler, which has supplied 100 Pacifica minivans integrated with Waymo's self-driving tech for testing on public roads in Arizona and California later this month.\n\nWaymo has recently changed some of its self-driving car plans in what appears to be an effort to bring the tech to market faster. Waymo originally was pursuing fully driverless cars without a steering wheel, brake, or gas pedals. In December, Waymo said that driver controls will not be removed due to the regulatory environment.\n\nThe decision came as Waymo faced setbacks pursuing a steering-wheel-less car and felt mounting pressure from Uber, which has launched public trials for its self-driving cars in recent months.\n\nWaymo has also said it is not in the business of physically building cars, and that it intends to instead supply self-driving tech to other companies. Bringing its hardware efforts in-house instead of outsourcing from Velodyne, as well as reducing the price of components, is in-line with that strategy.\n\nWaymo has said it can see its self-driving tech being used for ride-hailing, personal transportation, public transit systems, and even trucking.\n\nGet the latest Google stock price here.", "For a certain kind of (slightly uptight) person, it’s easy to spend far more time futzing with your to-do list than actually, you know, doing the things on it. You can spend hours playing with new apps—Wunderlist! Todoist! Any.do! Asana!—and new methods—Kanban! GTD! Pomodoro! The Eisenhower Matrix! These are all real things! I understand that wonderful wash of organizational bliss that you get from taking all the crap on your floor and stacking it in neat piles. Have you actually, you know, accomplished anything? Of course not. But you feel fantastic.\n\nPersonally, I’ve spent countless hours testing and tweaking every productivity app and system I could find. Eventually, I realized the answer’s been right in front of my face all along. Over the last few years, Google has quietly built the best to-do list app on Earth—without building a to-do list app at all. Making it work for you is easier than you think, too. It’s all about a single word: reminders.\n\nFree downloads\n\nThere are three core parts to the Google Reminders Industrial Complex: Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Inbox. You can add reminders from any of the three. Get an email you need to do something with? Hit the pin in Inbox to keep it in front of you, or click on the clock and choose a specific time you want to see it again. Or, just click on the Compose button and choose reminder instead of email. Any note in Keep can be turned into a reminder the same way. And in Google Calendar, adding a reminder is exactly as easy as adding an event. You can add them by time (“Pick up the kids at 6”) or location (“Call Joe when I get to work”), or just pick “Someday” to file it into a running list of stuff you have to do…someday. No matter what, everything stays in sync everywhere.\n\n\n\nThe exact connection between all these apps is sort of a mess. And actually, when you stop to think about it, Google’s productivity play is almost as disjointed as its messaging ecosystem (HEY-O!). Google Tasks is not the same thing as Google Reminders, and Tasks won’t work with this system. You can’t see all your Inbox reminders in Google Keep, for some reason I can’t figure out.\n\nThere’s only one place that will show all your reminders in one spot: Inbox. The Inbox inbox (this terminology is terrible) will intersperse your reminders with your emails, so you can see everything you need to deal with right in front of your face. In Google Calendar, you see any task with a due date or time. You can drag stuff around there, which is an awesome way to actually schedule the stuff you need to do. It also increases the likelihood of you actually doing those things.\n\nA new outlook on email\n\nOne of the cardinal rules of online productivity is to separate your email from your to-do list. We all get too much email, and it’s easy to let the incoming junk drown out the things that are actually important. This is true, but there’s a flipside: Your email inbox is a perfect place for a to-do list precisely because you’re already spending so much time there. You already have one inbox to check, so why create more? Google’s setup is smart precisely because it’s designed to work all the places you already do. You send yourself drafts of emails to remember stuff, and instead of shaming you for it Google made those drafts much more useful. It doesn’t matter how you get stuff in the Google atmosphere, just get it in there.\n\nYour first job is just to dump as much as you can into the system. You can email yourself things to do, or put them in your calendar, or take quick notes, or take a picture. Then, once you get everything in the system, process it all as fast as you can. Anything you don’t need to deal with right now, either mark it done or snooze it for later. (Seriously, snoozing an email until tomorrow is the best feeling ever.) Even if you don’t get everything done, that’s fine—your tasks will follow you around until you complete them or snooze them again. You wind up with no choice but to actually get stuff done, if only to just clear out your calendar and inbox.\n\nPro tools\n\nAll you really need to make Google work as a productivity system is either Inbox or Calendar. Calendar’s probably the best place to start, if only because the app is so good on every platform. (The only thing you can’t do in Calendar is add tasks with no due-date, which is lame.) Keep is really just a collection and note-taking tool, more able to hoover up quick lists and photos than the other systems. It’s also the best place to keep a grocery list. Once you’re set up and want to get full-on #productive with the Google system, there are a bunch of tips and tools you should know and use:\n\nIf you’re a Chrome user, there are extensions that let you save webpages or text to Keep or Inbox with only one click. On iOS or Android, just use the Share extensions.\n\nIf you’re in Chrome, you can type “my reminders” into the search box to see a list of everything you have to do. Or type “Remind me to pick up my dry cleaning tomorrow at 5PM” to save a reminder right there.\n\nIf you use the Google app for iOS, or just open Google Now in Android, you can also access and add reminders with a couple of taps.\n\nThere’s a great Mac app for Inbox called Boxy, which is $5.99 but really nice-looking and a handy way to keep your reminders from disappearing into the tab abyss. You can also make Fluid instances of each app, or just use them as browser tabs.\n\nIf you download the Google Keep Chrome app, you can use the app even when you don’t have an Internet connection. In Google Calendar, all you have to do is tweak a setting. Inbox doesn’t seem to work offline yet, which is stupid.\n\nYou know how you say to your Amazon Echo, “Add AA batteries to my shopping list?” If you use Google Keep, you can do the same thing. Say “Add AA batteries to my shopping list,” and as long as you have a note with that name it’ll add to the bottom. If not, it’ll create a new note with that name.\n\nYou can let the system get as complicated as you like, and there are lots of tools and tricks if you really dive in. (You should definitely be color-coding your Keep notes.) But the beauty of the Google Reminders Industrial Complex is that it’s absurdly simple to add stuff because you can add from basically anywhere. It’s easy to see what you have to do because it’s right in front of you at all times. The only thing you have to do is work to keep your inbox clean—even if that means snoozing everything until tomorrow. Which feels pretty good all by itself.", "When Google unveiled its new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones last month, several things were immediately obvious. For example, in light of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle Samsung was suffering through, it was obvious that Google’s new phones would be the best option out there for Android enthusiasts seeking out the best premium smartphones money can buy. It was also obvious that deep Google Assistant integration was going to be a huge benefit over rival handsets.\n\nOn the other hand, it was also obvious that in terms of design, the new Pixel and Pixel XL were so familiar that it was almost uncomfortable. In a nutshell, they looked exactly like iPhones, but with a peculiar glass panel slapped on the back. The explanation behind Google’s decision reuse Apple’s iPhone design has been something of a mystery ever since the phones debuted, but now we finally know exactly how it happened.\n\nDON’T MISS: This iPhone 7 video review from a hardcore Android fan is making Android users want to switch\n\nWhen Google unveiled its new Pixel phones, company executives repeatedly sought to make it clear that these phones were designed solely by Google, inside and out, with no input from the company’s manufacturing partner HTC. This seemed odd, of course, because the Pixel looks suspiciously similar to HTC’s recent iPhone copycats. But hey, Google said that the company did its own thing, so we took Google’s word for it.\n\nAs it turns out, HTC apparently wasn’t involved in the design at all, just like Google said. A newly discovered video posted recently on YouTube by PeripateticPandas gives the world a behind the scenes look at how Google created the Pixel phone. We won’t spoil the fun — the full video is embedded below.", "Google's pop-up shop opened today in New York City, and it's a swanky space in the heart of SoHo for people to check out the Pixel, Google Home, and Daydream VR for themselves. The shop doesn't actually have any products for sale, though — you'll have to do that online or at Verizon and Best Buy retail stores.\n\nThe space showcases different products in different corners, with an IKEA-esque living room and kitchen setup where people can test out Google Home's features in a setting that looks like a home. There's also a Daydream VR area where you can sit on swivel low-poly rock chairs and try on the VR headsets, and a cool lighting installation where you can get your photo taken with a Pixel phone, which is meant to demonstrate the Pixel's low-lighting photography capabilities.

Google confirmed the news and said Hardy’s role was new, but declined to share further details, such as what exactly the job entails.\n\n“Like all new undertakings, the specifics will work themselves out,” Hardy replied via Twitter direct message. He said he starts Feb. 6 and will be splitting his time between San Francisco and Mountain View.\n\nHe went on to espouse the benefits of cloud computing: “I truly believe that what cloud represents is a dramatic transformation of business, economics and much else. It will take place over years, but the nexus of sensors / mobile computing, large cloud systems and AI will remake the world on a scale of electricity, automotive power, etc. ...\n\n“I know that sounds grandiose, but this is a dramatic change in its earliest days.

The problem is, both Apple and Google have great photo-storage services, and it’s hard to know which one is actually better. Here’s how Apple Photos and Google Photos stack up against each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the purposes of this guide, we’re including the optional iCloud Photo Library as part of Apple Photos to make it a fair fight. While we can’t cover every small detail and difference between these two services, you should get a good idea of how they compare.\n\nPlatforms and apps\n\nApple Photos comes baked into Apple’s own mobile and desktop operating systems, and it’s a little harder to access on other platforms. You can use Photos on iOS, Photos on macOS, and iCloud on the web to get at your pictures very easily, but there’s no Android app. iCloud for Windows gives some basic downloading and uploading functionality for those running Microsoft’s OS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle Photos, like a lot of Google products, is made to be used with an internet connection. There’s a slick and comprehensive app available through any browser. Mobile apps for Android and iOS let you upload and access pictures on mobile, and there are also desktop tools for Windows and macOS. Google Photos can also integrate neatly with Google Drive, so you can use the Drive desktop clients instead.\n\nIf you’re using Apple Photos, there’s no Android support and limited support on Windows. Google’s service is definitively easier to use across multiple platforms and has a better web app, but if you use Apple products like the iPhone and Macbook, then you’ll probably be happier using iCloud.\n\nPricing and storage\n\nGoogle Photos lets you back up an unlimited number of photos and videos, provided you’re prepared to put up with a little bit of resizing (images must be a maximum of 16 megapixels and videos top out at 1080p). If you want original, untouched uploads, then the app uses Google Drive. Everyone gets 15GB for free on Google Drive, and upgrade prices start at 100GB for $1.99 a month.\n\nSponsored\n\nThere’s technically no ‘free tier’ on Apple Photos, but you can choose not to use iCloud Photo Library at all and keep your pictures only on your devices. We wouldn’t recommend that because if something happens to your phone, you’re screwed. iCloud storage will give you 5GB for free, but most people will fill up that space in a matter of months. By paying extra for iCloud, you can easily add more space. Pricing starts at $0.99 a month for 50GB.\n\nThe iCloud and Google Drive pricing tiers are broadly comparable, with (for example) 1TB of cloud storage space costing you $9.99 a month. That is the limit for Apple users, though, whereas Google Drive goes all the way up to 30TB (a cool $299.99 a month). Google’s unlimited, free, and easy to use storage system is perfect for most casual users and even pro photographers. When it comes to pricing and storage, it’s an easy win for Google Photos.\n\nIntegrated editing options\n\nIf you want to do more than just store your photos, the fact that Apple has a native app for macOS gives it a slight edge for advanced editing options. Google has some decent editing tools, but they can’t quite match Photos for macOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn mobile, both Apple Photos and Google Photos offer some handy editing tools covering basic adjustments and filters (but remember Apple Photos is iOS-only). Apple Photos does have a few more powerful tweaks available. The options in Google Photos are identical across the web and mobile, but for anything serious on either service you’re going to have to fire up Photoshop or GIMP.\n\nApple Photos has a more comprehensive set of editing tools available on mobile (if you stick to iOS) and desktop (if you stick to macOS). Add to that the fact that Apple’s apps can be enhanced with third-party extensions and it’s an easy win for Apple in the photo editing category.\n\n\n\nAlbums and sharing\n\nLog into either Google Photos or Apple Photos and you’ll see your pictures organized by date, with the newest images showing up first. Sticking pictures into albums manually is straightforward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor our money, navigating around Apple Photos is just a little more intuitive than its rival from Google, though your mileage may vary. On macOS it also lets you build smart albums (like smart playlists in iTunes) that filter photos automatically based on their metadata.\n\nHow you choose to organize your photos is up to you, but both these apps do a clever job of creating automatic albums (places, times, even selfies). If you don’t want to go through the trouble of organizing everything manually, this is a great option. Google’s approach is a little simpler and slicker, but not by much.\n\nBoth Google Photos and Apple Photos let you create shared albums that other people have access to (and can add pictures to). Right now the whole process is more straightforward in Google’s apps—possibly as a result of all the different iterations that Apple’s photo products have been through, and sharing is just better on Android in general which also gives it a slight edge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s more or less a draw in this category, with only minor differences between both apps. It will ultimately come down to which app you’re most familiar with and most comfortable using every day.\n\nOther features and privacy\n\nSmart search is a feature Google has made much of in promoting its photo service and one which Apple is now trying to catch up to. You can search for animals, scenes, people, times and more, and everything works very accurately.\n\nApple is slowly inching its way up to the standards of Google, and new features including facial recognition are about to land in the Photos apps for iOS 10 and macOS Sierra. The updates also include tools to automatically create highlights reels for certain events, something Apple calls Memories and Google Photos calls Collections.\n\nWhile Apple Photos can find faces, places, and dates, it still doesn’t have quite the versatility or power in its searching options as Google Photos does, perhaps because it’s less focused on the cloud part of the service. Search options are pretty much non-existent in the Photos part of iCloud on the web too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you want to organize your pictures manually, then either product will do, but Google makes that process easier by letting you use search as an organizational tool (as it does with Gmail). It’s also worth mentioning you can create collages and animations straight from the Google Photos interface.\n\nAs always in Google and Apple comparisons, there are privacy considerations: all your data is stored on Google’s servers, whereas with Apple the extra smarts (like the places you’ve been) and searches are kept locked down on your local devices even if the 1s and 0s of the pictures themselves are stored in iCloud.\n\nThe final verdict\n\nFrom prices to editing tools, these two giant photo services are pretty much evenly matched in most key features. Yes there are differences, but very few stand-out ones. Both do a fine job of storing and organizing your pictures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe unlimited uploads option (with resizing) in Google Photos is likely to be appealing for most users who aren’t professional photographers. Google also wins in terms of cross-platform support if you want to access your pictures from anywhere. Its searching features are also the most intelligent and comprehensive right now.\n\nApple Photos, as you might expect, is more convenient and more powerful than if you’re already using an iPhone. It’s also nice if you don’t need online functionality, or if you’re happy to spend money on the iCloud Photo Library.\n\nThe changes coming to Apple Photos later this year suggest picture management is going to be another area where Apple will steal an idea from Google Photos, leaving the two products even more alike. Still, with Google’s constant investment in its cloud services and slight edges over Apple Photos in a few key areas—we’d suggest Google Photos for most people.", "You know what people love? When you take something familiar and useful and replace it with content “for you” that you actually didn’t ask for. That’s one of the more visible changes in the latest version of Chrome for Android, which swaps out the bookmarks and recently visited items (above) on the new tab page for “suggested articles.”\n\nI don’t know about you, but I open a lot of new tabs every day, and I appreciated the utility of the old new tab page as much as I dislike the idea of Google constantly guessing at what I might want to read. And while it may be a nice option to opt into, it’s a bit much for Google to just push this content, which for all we know is sponsored, onto every new tab on mobile.\n\nDo you like it? Nice, enjoy! But if not, don’t fret: it’s (relatively) easy to disable, as Android Police reader Matt shows us.\n\nAll you need to do is change two hidden settings. Copy each of the links below (you can trust me) and paste them into new tabs. Each will bring up a complicated-looking settings page, with one item highlighted at the top. Tap the little drop-down menu, which probably reads “default,” and select “disabled.”\n\nDon’t touch the other stuff unless you know what you’re doing — some of these are important. It’ll prompt you to restart Chrome after you make these changes — do so and you should be back to the old new tab page.\n\nEven if you aren’t seeing the suggested articles feature yet, you should be able to preemptively disable it this way if you’re on a recent version of Chrome. Just switch things back to “default” if you want to give the feature another go.\n\nGoogle will likely add a better way to do this in the future, but for now this is how it has to be done.", "Google has launched Android Things, an Android-based device OS for the Internet of Things. Combined with Weave, this software will play a crucial role in Google’s IoT strategy.\n\nAndroid Things heats up the device market with a new OS. Microsoft is pushing Windows 10 IoT to hobbyists and OEMs. Though Amazon doesn’t have a device OS, it is making AWS Lambda available to IoT developers. AWS is partnering with device manufacturers to bundle Lambda Greengrass, a local version of AWS Lambda that can be installed in IoT devices and hubs.\n\nMainstream cloud providers – Amazon, Google, and Microsoft – are banking on the IoT strategy to drive traction for their respective cloud platforms.\n\nAndroid Things is the latest attempt from Google to connect the dots between the cloud and devices.\n\nHere are ten things you should know about Android Things.\n\nAndroid Things is a rebranded version Google Brillo, an OS that Google announced in 2015. Though the core of Brillo was Android, the development and deployment experience was significantly different from regular Android development. Brillo used C++ as the primary development environment while Android Things targets all Java developers with or without mobile development experience. Developers can use the toolkit to target IoT devices. Android Studio, the popular IDE for Android based on JetBrains’ IntelliJ IDEA, supports IoT development through Android Things. The lifecycle of application development almost remains the same as mobile development. Android Things OS supports a subset of the original Android SDK. APIs that require user input or authentication credentials such as AdMob, Maps, Search, and Sign-In are not supported. Like the OTA updates for Android Phones, developers can push Google-provided OS updates and custom app updates using the same OTA infrastructure that Google uses for its products and services. Google recommends Raspberry Pi 3, Intel Edison, and NXP Pico for the initial prototyping and developing. Additional certified devices will be added by the general availability of Android Things. Google Cloud Platform components including Firebase can be easily integrated with Android Things. Developers will be able to utilize various cloud services for storage, state management, and messaging. Android Things is integrated with Weave, the communication platform for IoT devices. Weave Server, the cloud service handles device registration, command propagation, storing of states, and integration with Google services like the Google Assistant. Weave SDK will be embedded in the devices for local and remote communication. Nest Weave, a protocol used by Nest devices will become a subset of Weave. Both these protocols are based on Thread, an IPV6 networking protocol that was originally designed for creating local wireless mesh networks. Weave can be used with or without Android Things. It’s an independent protocol that can be an alternative to Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Bluetooth Smart.\n\nJanakiram MSV is an analyst, advisor, and architect.

The new feature, which will first be available on the Lenovo Phab2 Pro superphone this September, is an indoor mapping technology...but it's also augmented reality. You can measure objects! Take dinosaur selfies! Live out your Ghostbuster fantasies.\n\nPerhaps most impressively, you can construct an elaborate chain of dominos across your entire house -- dominos only you can see -- and knock them all down without having any mess to clean up later. How can a smartphone be indoor Google Maps and a window to another world at the same time?\n\nI could tell you, but it's so much easier to show you. Just watch the video above.\n\nStill a little confused? Let me take one last stab at breaking Tango down.\n\n\"Two cameras see the world in 3D\" = When you take a picture with a normal camera, it's flat. You don't know how far away objects actually are. With two cameras, and/or a time-of-flight sensor like the one inside this Phab2 Pro, the camera sees depth as well. It knows how far away your walls, floors and furniture are.\n\n\"Map your room and know where you are\" = Tango can create digital 3D maps of your surroundings, and memorize them. Then, based on the memorized landmarks it's seen, it can figure out where your phone is (and even its orientation) compared to those landmarks. Watch Google explain it right here.\n\n\"See virtual objects on top of the real world\" = Once your phone knows precisely where your furniture is, where your phone is and which direction it's facing, it can act like a window into a virtual world. You can place virtual dominos on top of your real-world table, as if they only existed in an alternate reality you can see through the window of your phone. It's like Microsoft's HoloLens, but in a phone.\n\nJust remember this: it takes two (cameras) to Tango.", "A virtual reality version of Google Earth is now available for free on the HTC Vive, letting users explore reconstructed cultural treasures, global landmarks, or (for some) their own homes in VR. Google Earth VR has been in development for some time, and it bears conceptual similarity to the version of Street View that Google released on its Cardboard and Daydream platforms. But where Street View offers strings of photospheres collected by 360-degree cameras, users of Earth VR can virtually fly freely around a topographical reconstruction of the globe, or take guided tours of places like Manhattan and Monument Valley.\n\nFor now, Earth VR is Vive-only, although VR Apps product manager Mike Podwal says Google is “actively exploring support for other platforms.” It’s the second Vive app that Google has released, after popular painting app Tilt Brush, which it acquired along with VR development studio Skillman & Hackett in 2014. And like non-VR Google Earth, it’s a little rough — many areas are just flat maps with rough topography, not fully constructed locations, and natural features like trees are blocky low-poly masses. But as virtual tourism goes, it’s a fairly grand option.\n\nEarth VR has obvious tie-ins with other parts of Google’s virtual reality efforts. Podwal and Earth VR engineering lead Dominik Kaeser see the project as a natural complement to Street View, although its full motion controls wouldn’t yet work on a platform like Daydream. At some point, the two could seamlessly blend into each other. Earth also seems like a natural fit for Expeditions, Google’s Cardboard-based VR education initiative.\n\nBut it’s more exciting to think about what people could do with an open version of the app, or a tool like the non-VR Google Earth Tour Builder. You could embed your own stories into Google Earth, or link personal photo spheres to specific places. Businesses could offer a VR version of their neighborhood the way they might embed a Google Maps widget on their website. Even without this, it still feels like one of the biggest, most open-ended VR apps available right now.", "Comparing Pixel, the first \"made by Google\" phone, with Samsung's Galaxy S7, one of its top competitors\n\nWhile Google is no stranger to smartphone manufacturing (the conglomerate has been overseeing Nexus design and manufacturing for years), the Pixel is the first phone to officially be dubbed \"Made by Google.\" How does the hotly anticipated Pixel compare to its industry-leading Android competitor, the Samsung Galaxy S7?\n\nSize\n\nThe two phones have the same width, but the Pixel is just a touch taller and thinner.\n\nWeight\n\nThe comparatively squat Galaxy S7 is 6-percent heavier than the Pixel.\n\nBuild\n\nWhen it comes to build, Google sticks with an iPhone-esque aluminum unibody, while Samsung keeps things interesting with slick curvy glass. The minimal aluminum frame nearly disappears into the glass front and back, which earned it major points in our review.\n\nWater resistance\n\nThe Galaxy 7 series has industry-leading water resistance. The IP68 rating means the S7 can withstand immersion in up to five feet of water for up to 30 minutes. Unfortunately, the first Google-branded phone offers no such reassurance.\n\nColors\n\nThere are three color variants for each model; both are available in black and silver. In addition, Pixel takes a more colorful route with a blue option, while S7 goes for the gold.\n\nDisplay size\n\nEven though the S7 is smaller, Samsung manages to sneak a little extra screen (2 percent more) onto its front surface area.\n\nDisplay resolution\n\nThe Pixel's 1,920 x 1,080 display meets the Full HD standard, but its resolution is still dwarfed next to the S7's Quad HD display. The difference might seem like overkill, but we bet that it makes a quite a difference when using mobile VR headsets.\n\nDisplay type\n\nBoth manufacturers fall on the same side of the fence when it comes to using IPS vs. AMOLED display technology.\n\nCurved display\n\nThe Pixel has a standard rectangular screen. The Galaxy S7's display hugs the curves of its glass front, curling ever so slightly around the edges of the phone.\n\nAlways-on display\n\nWe'll be able to confirm this once we perform our full-length review of the Pixel, but for now, it does not seem to have an \"always-on\" display option like the S7 does. This feature lets you see key notifications at a glance, without having to unlock the phone.\n\nPressure-sensitive display\n\nApple has developed a pressure-sensitive display that lets you lightly tap or firmly press the touchscreen for different results, but similar capabilities have yet to come to Android devices. Neither of these phones have a pressure-sensitive display.\n\nCamera megapixels\n\nThe two devices have matching rear camera resolution, but with a notable 3-megapixel advantage, the Pixel is the selfie champ.\n\nCamera aperture (rear)\n\nThe smaller the f-stop, the larger the aperture. A larger aperture means sharper photos in low light, among other things. S7 beats Pixel in this department.\n\nOptical image stabilization\n\nOptical image stabilization is absent from the Pixel. That means you'll see less noticeable camera shake and consequential photo blur from the OIS-equipped S7.\n\nDual-lens camera\n\nUnlike the iPhone 7 Plus or the Huawei Honor 8, there are no fancy dual-lens tricks here.\n\nCharging/data port\n\nPixel uses a more universal USB-C charging/data port, while the S7 uses the smaller microUSB.\n\nBattery\n\nBoth phones have fairly large batteries, but the S7 edges out the Pixel. According to Google, a full Pixel charge will get you up to 26 hours of talk time and up to 13 hours of internet use or video playback over Wi-Fi. By Samsung's count, the S7 is good for up to 28 hours of talk time, 13 hours of internet use, or 16 hours of video playback.\n\nFast charging\n\nBoth phones offer the convenience of a quick charge.\n\nWireless charging\n\nThe S7 can be charged wirelessly using a charge pad (sold separately), but not the Pixel.\n\nProcessor\n\nThe two processors have the same clock speeds, but the Pixel's is a slightly newer version.\n\nRAM\n\nThese phones have matching amounts of memory.\n\nInternal storage\n\nBoth phones have 32 and 128-gigabyte storage sizes. The S7 also offers an intermediate 64-gigabyte option.\n\nmicroSD\n\nNo matter which size S7 you get, rest assured knowing you'll never run out of space thanks to the phone's microSD expandable storage.\n\nVR headset compatibility\n\nGoogle's Pixel phones and Samsung's Galaxy 7 series are the leading virtual reality-ready phones on the market. Pixel is Daydream View-compatible; Gear VR is Samsung's offering.\n\nHeadphone jack\n\nBe relieved, owners of expensive headphones: Android manufacturers haven't axed the headphone jack yet.\n\nFingerprint sensor\n\nFingerprint sensors are practically non-negotiable smartphone features at this point. Google puts its sensor on the back of the Pixel; Samsung's is incorporated into the home button.\n\nMobile payments\n\nBoth phones are equipped for mobile payments. Samsung Pay is supported in more countries, and it's accepted by more merchants within those countries. Why? Samsung Pay can actually mimic the swiping of a magnetic strip in addition to NFC transactions, so merchants shouldn't need any newfangled equipment to accept it.\n\nVirtual assistant\n\nGoogle Assistant (the newest iteration of Google Now) makes its first appearance on the Pixel and Pixel XL. We have not yet tried out this voice-activated virtual assistant for ourselves, but it is shaping up to be a more powerful alternative to the Google Now/S Voice features on the Galaxy S7.\n\nOperating system\n\nAs Google's first real flagship, Pixel will launch running the absolute latest version of its operating system, Android 7.1 Nougat. Google has said Pixel will be on the forefront of new updates for the next two years and will receive security updates for three years.\n\nAs of now, the Galaxy S7 is running Android Marshmallow with Samsung's proprietary TouchWiz skin. In the past, Samsung has taken 5-6 months to roll out its customized updates, which would place the Nougat update sometime in the beginning of 2017.\n\n\n\nRelease\n\nThe recently launched Pixel is the newcomer to the market. The S7 was released earlier this year.\n\nStarting price (full retail)\n\nSamsung prices vary depending on carrier and payment plan, but you'll likely pay about US$20 more for a Galaxy S7 over Google's Pixel. However, the Samsung flagship's specs sneak past Google's in a number of areas. The extra cash could be well worth it, particularly if you're drawn to its glass build, water resistance, expandable storage, or the versatility of Samsung Pay.\n\nStill, as the first \"made by Google\" phone, Pixel could offer a cohesive software and hardware experience not seen in other Android phones. We're also excited to see how the Daydream View experience compares to that of the Gear VR.\n\nWe'll post a full length review of the Pixel once the phones ship. Until then, read up on what the Galaxy S7 has to offer, or check out News Atlas' comparisons of the Pixel and iPhone 7, or the Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus.", "Telecommunications companies are becoming media companies. That explains AT&T’s agreement to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion. But something else explains it, too.\n\nMedia companies are becoming telecoms.\n\nInternet firms like Google and Facebook and Amazon and Netflix are the new media companies. They deliver enormous amounts of video online, posing a direct threat to old-school television and movie companies. But they also are becoming telecoms, threatening the likes of AT&T and Verizon.\n\nThey finance undersea cables that link their data centers. They buy fiber optic infrastructure. Facebook builds open source telco gear, Google offers high-speed Internet service, Amazon hopes to become an Internet service provider in Europe.\n\nAs this happens, telecoms must fight back. And this means challenging tech giants on the media front.\n\nThe proposed AT&T/Time Warner deal combines two powerhouses. AT&T is the nation’s largest pay TV provider, the second-largest wireless provider, and the third-largest home Internet provider.\n\nTime Warner owns a dizzying array of media properties, including HBO, CNN, Warner Brothers, DC Comics, TBS, TNT, the Cartoon Network and broadcast rights to many live sporting events. But it does not own Time Warner Cable, a separate entity that the cable company Charter Communications bought earlier this year.\n\nThe deal confirmed today follow’s Comcast’s merger with NBC in 2011 and Verizon’s acquisition of AOL last year and planned acquisition of Yahoo this year.\n\nPundits quickly noted that diving into the content industry could be AT&T’s attempt to fill the hole that is created as customers ditch cable TV in favor of streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube. That’s true, but another shift is happening, too.\n\nFor years, the big telecom Internet providers essentially operated as dumb pipes. All they did was deliver content. That used to make a lot of sense. A decade ago, the dotcom crash was still a recent memory, and digital piracy threatened to undercut the entire entertainment industry.\n\nHow things have changed. AT&T, Comcast and Verizon have watched Amazon, Facebook, and Google take their place among the world’s most valuable—and powerful—companies, using infrastructure owned by the telcos. The entertainment industry rebounded as well, with upstarts like Netflix having reinvented the very idea of television.\n\nWhat’s more, those same tech companies have increasingly encroached on the telco’s business. They threaten to upend telecommunications much like they’ve upended other industries, aided by the Federal Communications Commission making more of the wireless spectrum available to them.\n\nGoogle in particular is eager to access more of the spectrum. And it has a few other projects going that could further undermine traditional telcos. Although Google Fiber and the companies wild schemes to use balloons and drones to deliver Internet access to remote areas garner a lot of attention, two other projects promise to be more radical.\n\nThe wireless Google Fi service essentially resells T-Mobile and Sprint’s service. Android phones can discern which carrier offers the strongest signal in any given location, allowing you to move seamlessly between Wi-Fi and the two carriers depending on signal strength. Apple is among the companies that may be developing similar technology.\n\nThis could lead to a situation in which your carrier is essentially invisible, and you’re paying Google (or another broker) to connect you to the network with the strongest signal. That could be a national carrier, or a local Wi-Fi provider.\n\nGoogle Station, an effort to provide a unified system for logging into and paying for Wi-Fi around the world, fits neatly into the vision as well.\n\nPut the pieces together and you begin to see a future in which tech companies have commoditized telcos in much the same way they commoditized computer hardware. Telcos, using cheap, off-the-shelf hardware powered by open source designs, could compete to sell bandwidth to the Googles and Amazons of the world at razor thin margins.\n\nAT&T probably isn’t thinking about this right now. Like the pundits say, it probably cares more about short-term gains like papering over any potential losses from cord cutting. Nor is any of this to say that the merger will be good for AT&T, let alone the public.\n\nRobert McChesney, a communication professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, says these kinds of mega-mergers rarely benefit the public. “This is a merger that will make no sense,” he says. “There’s no reason this merger should be done for consumers or workers.”\n\nThese sorts of deals rarely pan out for the companies involved. New York University economics professor Nicholas S. Economides notes that AT&T’s has a checkered history of acquisitions. For example, it bought business technology company NCR in 1991 for $7.4 billion, only to spin spin it off six years later for $3.4 billion. And who could forget Time Warner’s disastrous $165 billion1 acquisition of AOL in 2000, which it unloaded in 2009 for $2.5 billion.\n\nIf regulators approve the AT&T and Time Warner merger, their blessing almost certainly will include stipulations barring it from, say, refusing to license its movies, television stations and other content to competitors like Comcast. That could make it hard to justify so expensive an acquisition.\n\nBut in a world where Internet access is a commodity, not a government-supported monopoly, owning a giant media company begins to make sense.\n\n1Correction 10/23/2016 at 11:30 AM ET: An earlier version of this story said that Time Warner acquired AOL for $165 million. It was $165 billion.\n\nCorrection 10/23/2016 at 1:04 PM ET: An earlier version used an incorrect logo for Time Warner.", "The wireless market is crowded, but despite the array of options it can be hard to find a good deal. and Verizon are well-established with widespread, high-quality service, but they also have the most expensive plans. Sprint and cost less, but can also be less reliable. And then there's a the whole horde of MVNO plans like Cricket Wireless, StraightTalk and MetroPCS that piggy-back off of other services to offer less costly plans.\n\nOnce an invitation-only service, Google's MVNO Project Fi opened to all comers in March 2016. It works by pinging off a three different carriers (, T-Mobile or Sprint) depending on which has the best signal where you are at the moment. Plans start at $20 for unlimited talk and text, and then each gigabyte of data is $10.\n\nSo at first glance, it seems like a great budget plan for someone looking for options outside of the America's four biggest carriers. I spent 30 days on the service, and while I wanted to love it, at the end I decided to move to another mobile provider. If you're thinking of switching to Project Fi, here are some of the biggest pros and cons to know about:\n\n1. It has straightforward pricing and usage info.\n\nIt's easy to know exactly how much you're spending on Project Fi in a given month. You set how much you think you'll need in data each month (in my case, I rather optimistically estimated 1GB) and then are only charged for exactly how much you use. If you go over your estimate, you'll get charged for the additional data but not overage fees. If you use less, you'll get some money back.\n\nIt's also easy to track exactly how much data you're using with the Project Fi app, downloadable from the Google Play Store. It tells you when your next bill is due, how much data you've used compared to your estimated use for the month, and how much you've used each day.\n\n2. It has fast, robot-free customer service.\n\nThe worst thing about calling most customer service lines is how difficult it is to talk to an actual person. The handful of times I had questions about my plan, I was able to log in to my account on the Project Fi website and open a chat window with a customer service person in under 5 minutes.\n\n3. You have to have a Google Nexus phone.\n\nProject Fi only works if you have a Nexus 6, 5X or 6P smartphone. While the Nexus phones are top-notch and get timely Android OS updates, this is still a pretty limiting selection.\n\n4. It's good for frequent international travelers.\n\nIf you travel a lot and want to use your phone outside of the United States, this could be the plan for you. Project Fi lets you use your phones data normally (read: with no insane roaming fees) in 135 different countries. You can also make phone calls over Wi-Fi normally, or place calls on a cellular network for 20 cents per minute. Texts aren't any additional cost whether on Wi-Fi or a cell network.\n\nIn short, unless you're making a lot of calls outside of Wi-Fi, your phone will work normally at no extra charge at almost any country you want to travel to.\n\n5. Data costs are the Achilles heel.\n\nIf you're a light data user (say just 1-2GB a month) Project Fi might be a great deal for you. But if you average more than 3GB, you're probably better off with another service. Say, for example, you want unlimited calls and texts and 4GB of data a month, that would cost $60 on Project Fi. For the same price, you can get an individual plan with unlimited data, talk and text on Sprint, or for $10 more you can get the same thing on T-Mobile.\n\nOne of Project Fi's biggest selling points is that it makes it easy to connect to Wi-Fi for your calls and data use, but even thought I live and work in the San Francisco Bay Area I found it difficult to be on Wi-Fi all the time. Just using my phone throughout my 45-min BART ride each way was enough to bust through my daily data budget.\n\nWhile Project Fi will refund you for any data that you sign up for but don't use, if you're a power user data costs can still jack up the price significantly.\n\nHave you used Google's Project Fi? Let us know what you think in the comments section.", "Last month, Google surprised everyone when it detailed plans for Angular 3 to be released a short six months after Angular 2's arrival. Now it turns out there will be no Angular 3 release after all. Instead, Google will go right to version 4 of its popular JavaScript framework in March.\n\nGoogle's Igor Minar said at the recent NG-BE 2016 Angular conference in Belgium that Google will jump from version 2 to version 4 so that the number of the upgrade correlates with the Angular version 4 router planned for usage with the release.\n\nMinar, in fact, laid out a road map that has eight beta releases of Angular 4 coming out between December and February, followed by two release candidates in February and the general release on March 1. But Minar cautioned against getting too hung up on numbers and advised that the framework simply be called \"Angular\" anyway. \"Let's not call it AngularJS, let's not call it Angular 2,\" he said, \"because as we are releasing more and more of these versions, it's going to be superconfusing for everybody.\"\n\nAngular is on an aggressive schedule that would have Angular 5 arriving in September/October 2017, followed in six months by Angular 6, with Angular 7 coming six months later in September/October 2018.\n\nGoogle's goals for Angular 4 are to be as backward-compatible with Angular 2 as possible and to improve compiler error messages. In November, Google talked about the next version of Angular, then known as version 3, emphasizing improvements in tooling as well as reduced code generation.\n\nAngular's upgrade plan also includes moving to TypeScript 2.1 as a baseline, away from TypeScript 1.8. While this means there are breaking changes, Minar was reassuring. \"It's not going to be a big deal. We did these migrations across the whole Google and it was quite trivial, but it does require [some interventions].\" Angular 2 was rewritten in TypeScript, Microsoft's typed superset of JavaScript.\n\nEarlier this month, Google earlier this month released Angular 2.3, a minor upgrade featuring Angular Language Service, which is designed to integrate with IDEs and provide type completion and error-checking with Angular Templates. Object inheritance for components is featured as well. Angular 2.2 arrived in November, featuring ahead-of-time compilation compatibility.", "Google Photos is a great way to store your personal photos and make them available across different devices -- and with the holiday season upon us, the potential for generating lots of photos is at an especially high level. But the service is far more than just a virtual cloud locker.\n\nPhotos has oodles of options, features and possibilities for viewing, manipulating and managing your digital memories. And many of them aren't immediately obvious. Take a few minutes to scan through these tips and make sure you're making the most of your Google Photos experience.\n\n(Note: Unless otherwise specified, all tips should work on any device/platform where Photos is available.)\n\nGetting around\n\n1. Move through Photos faster with keyboard shortcuts: From the desktop website, press Shift-? to get a list of available commands.\n\n2. Find the Photos view that works best for you: In the mobile app, try pinching in or out on the main gallery to make the thumbnails smaller or larger. You can choose from four different views.\n\n3. Aside from changing your view, pinching can help you move throughout the Photos mobile app. Once you've found your way to the closest possible view, pinching \"out\" (by moving your fingers apart) on any individual image will open that image in full. And pinching \"in\" (moving your fingers together) on any image (while viewing it in full) will always take you back to your main image list.\n\n4. Not a fan of pinching? The Photos mobile app also has a hidden swipe-based shortcut: While viewing any image in full, simply swipe up or down on the screen to jump back to your main image list. Who needs that blasted Back button, anyway?\n\nWhen you're scrolling through Photos on your phone and want to jump to a specific date, use the quick-scroll icon on the right side of the screen.\n\n5. When you're scrolling through Photos on your phone and want to jump to a specific date, touch the quick-scroll icon on the right side of the screen. Then just move your finger up or down to fly back in time faster than a flux capacitor would allow.\n\n6. The next time you need to select a bunch of consecutive photos from your phone, don't do the one-tap-at-a-time dance. Instead, touch your finger to the first photo until it becomes highlighted, and then -- without lifting -- drag your finger up or down to quickly select a whole set of images.\n\n7. Flawless as I know you are, you may one day discover you deleted a photo by accident. Take note now: Photos has a \"Trash\" folder that's accessible via the app's main menu. Every axed image stays there for 60 days and can be recovered with a couple quick taps or clicks.\n\nSearching and discovering\n\n8. One of Photos' greatest strengths is its image-sorting intelligence. You can use the search bar at the top of the app to find photos based on all sorts of terms -- month, season, location or even objects or general themes.\n\nSome interesting search term ideas to get you started:\n\nflowers\n\nbaby\n\nwedding\n\nconcert\n\ndancing\n\nwinter\n\nParis\n\nHalloween\n\nbirthday\n\nbeach\n\nwater\n\nfood\n\nbaking\n\ndogs\n\nselfies\n\nblue (or any other color -- try it!)\n\nNote that if you've never used Photos before, it may take a little while for newly added images to start appearing in searches.\n\n9. Prefer browsing over freeform searching? You can go to the Albums tab (accessed on the left side of the desktop website or the bottom of the mobile app) and then look at the carousel at the top to scroll through common terms specific to your collection.\n\n10. Google Photos can also help you find images based on who appears in them -- even if it doesn't know every person's name. Go to the Albums tab and select \"People\" to see a list of faces from your collection. If you want to be able to search for someone by name, just tap her face, select \"Who is this?\" and put in whatever name or nickname you prefer. That name will then appear whenever you start typing the first few letters into the app's search bar.\n\nIf you see someone's face showing up in two different places within the \"People\" section, it's not difficult to correct the error.\n\n11. In theory, Photos recognizes how a person ages over time and groups all the photos in which he appears together -- but in reality, it doesn't always get it right. If you see someone's face showing up in two different places within the \"People\" section, first use the naming process described above to make sure the person is properly labeled. Then tap the second place where the person appears, select \"Who is this?\" and select his name from the list to correct the error.\n\n12. You can also manually remove images from a person's grouping by clicking or tapping the menu icon in the upper-right corner of the screen and then selecting the option labeled \"Remove results.\" Select the out-of-place photos, then select the blue \"Remove\" button that appears in the upper-right corner.\n\n13. If you're hunting for something specific in your collection, try using multiple search terms together -- \"dog and park,\" for instance, or \"Mom and Dad.\" You could even find photos of your daughter in pink by searching for her name (provided you've labeled her, as described in tip 10) and the word \"pink.\"\n\n14. Feeling lazy? You can search your Google Photos by emoji (yes, really!). Try 😎 for photos involving glasses, for instance, or 💗 for photos involving hearts.\n\n15. You can find the photos you uploaded most recently by going to the Photos website and clicking the search bar -- then clicking the link labeled \"Show More\" followed by \"Recently Added.\"\n\nOrganizing and optimizing\n\n16. If you see some images out of order in your collection, odds are they were captured with the wrong date. (Perhaps, ahem, someone forgot to set the clock correctly on his or her camera?) Not to worry, though: There's a quick fix. From the desktop site, select the photos in question (by clicking the checkmark in the upper-left corner of their thumbnail), then click the menu icon in the upper-right corner and select \"Edit date & time.\"\n\nYou can change the date of a photo on the desktop site by selecting the photo and then clicking on the menu in the upper right corner.\n\n17. Keeping all your smartphone photos backed up to the cloud is smart, but watch out: All that data transferring can take a serious toll on your mobile device's stamina. Do your battery a favor and set Photos to back up only when your phone is charging. Just head into the app's settings, tap \"Back up & sync\" and then look for the option labeled \"While charging only.\"\n\n18. Want Photos to back up images beyond just those taken with your phone's camera -- pictures you've downloaded, perhaps, or screenshots you've captured? Go back into the app's settings, select \"Back up & sync\" and then \"Back up device folders.\" Flip the switch on any folder there to have its contents automatically and continually synced with your Photos library.\n\n19. Since all your smartphone photos are backed up to the cloud, you can safely delete your phone's local copies whenever you need to free up some space. Just look for the option called \"Free up device storage\" in the Photos app's settings to get started. (The app may also automatically prompt you to do this if your phone's storage gets low.)\n\n20. Let's face it: Uploading a ton of images from your computer to the cloud can be a real chore. Take the pain out of the process by snagging Google's free desktop uploader tool, available for both macOS and Windows. The program makes it possible to batch-transfer images; it also gives you the option to automatically sync new images whenever a camera or card gets plugged into your system.\n\n21. Google has a handy tool for \"scanning\" your old printed photos directly into your collection via your phone's camera. It's called PhotoScan, and it works with most any Android or iOS device.\n\n22. Google Photos may generally be a cloud-centric service, but if you feel more comfortable keeping a local copy of your entire image collection, there is a way. First, you'll need to download and install the free Google Drive app for macOS or Windows. Make sure it's set up to sync everything in your Drive to a folder on your computer.\n\nNext, head to the Drive website, click the gear icon in the upper-right corner, select \"Settings\" and then check the box next to \"Create a Google Photos folder.\" That'll put a folder with all your photos into your Drive storage. And since you already have Drive set to sync with your computer, that folder will always remain backed up and synced -- both ways -- with your corresponding local folder.\n\n23. For a one-time batch download of your entire collection -- without the ongoing two-way sync -- visit Google's Takeout tool.\n\nSharing and showing\n\n24. Photos makes it easy to share your images with anyone -- whether they use the service themselves or not. The simplest way is to select any image or images, tap the share icon at the top of the screen and then select \"Create link\" from the mobile app or \"Get link\" from the website. Anyone you send the link to will be able to view the photos and optionally add them into their own Photos collection (if they do use the service).\n\nYou'll also see an option to let other people add their own photos into the album -- if, say, you're sharing photos from a family event and want everyone to be able to contribute.\n\n25. Need to manage or delete a shared album? Open the app's main menu and select \"Shared.\" Select whichever album you want, then tap the menu icon in the upper-right corner to find sharing options along with the option to delete the album entirely.\n\n26. If you want to be sure your location is never included with any images you share, go to Photos' main settings and look for the item labeled \"Remove geo location\" from the mobile app or \"Remove geo location in items shared by link\" from the website.\n\n27. Got a TV with Chromecasting capability? Show off your photos on the big screen by tapping the cast icon in the upper-right corner of the mobile app (it should appear anytime a cast-ready TV is available). Once you're connected, just tap any image to have it beamed to your television. If you want to have multiple images display in a slideshow, open an image (either from your full collection or from an album) and then tap the menu icon in the upper-right corner of the screen and select \"Slideshow.\"\n\nEditing and remixing\n\n28. Photos has some powerful tools for tweaking and editing images. While viewing any image, select the pencil icon on the screen to see a range of one-touch refinishing tools as well as more detailed controls for fine-tuning and cropping. (For fine-tuning, after you select the middle icon -- the one that looks like a series of sliders -- be sure to click or tap the down-facing arrows next to \"Light\" and \"Color\" in order to see all the available options.)\n\n29. Who says a gray day has to be dreary? While editing an image with sky in the background, go to the fine-tuning tab and then tap or click the down-facing arrow next to \"Color.\" The slider labeled \"Deep blue\" will let you make a pale sky appear more blue without affecting the rest of the photo.\n\nThe slider labeled \"Deep blue\" will let you make a pale sky appear more blue without affecting the rest of the photo.\n\n30. When you tap the option to save an image after editing, take note that your newly modified version will replace the original. If you want to save it as a copy instead, avoid the large \"Save\" command and instead tap the menu icon in the top-right of the screen to find the \"Save copy\" option.\n\n31. In addition to regular edits, Photos lets you make super-simple movies, animations and collages from any set of images and/or videos. Just select the items you want, select the \"+\" option at the top of the screen and then choose what kind of creation you want to try.\n\n32. Don't forget to peek at Photos' Assistant tab from time to time. The service leaves all sorts of interesting treats for you there -- everything from automatically generated animations, collages and highlight videos to \"this day in history\"-style flashbacks from your collection. It'll also create instant albums from related images and offer to fix photos that are flipped the wrong way.", "Most of the time I’m happy to have gone all-in on Apple. But I feel backed into a corner when it comes to paying for even more iCloud storage when it’s necessitated by Apple’s increasingly cloud-centric app bundles. See, the best way to live inside of the Apple ecosystem is to use the company’s free (as it loves to remind us) apps. But Apple caps its free iCloud storage tier at a paltry 5GB — capacity that’s quickly filled with Live Photos, iOS app data, 4k video, GIFs everyone’s sending you in the new iMessages; and critically, iOS device backups. So in reality, Apple’s apps are not free — Apple charges you for them indirectly by requiring you to purchase more and more storage over time.\n\nSome call it cheeky, but I'd call it deceptive\n\nSome call this approach cheeky, but I'd call it deceptive in 2016. Apple sells you on a premium experience that’s undercut by the menial reality of its storage plans. It’s like buying a Rolex and then being required to buy a plastic bag just to carry it out of the store.\n\nApple likes touting its new iCloud Drive sync feature that makes all your desktop files accessible from your Macs and iOS devices. Apple even asks you to enable it when upgrading to Sierra. Trouble is, my desktop, like yours perhaps, is my workspace, containing hundreds of screenshots, drafts, photos, and videos. I have so many files on my iMac’s desktop that Sierra prompted me to purchase more storage during installation. \"Ugh!\" I thought, feeling like a dolt for believing my free OS upgrade wouldn't cost anything. I decided not to pay so I'm currently not able to use this feature.\n\nI don’t mind paying for storage as long as it’s reasonably priced, but Apple’s 1TB pricing is not reasonable, especially when the iPhone’s camera is a major selling point and iCloud Photos is the culprit maxing out everyone's storage plans.\n\nApple charges $9.99 per month for 1TB of iCloud storage, or roughly $120 per year. Compare that to Amazon, where for $4.99 per month you get unlimited storage. Hell, Amazon Prime subscribers ($99 per year) get free unlimited photo storage as just one of many membership perks. Microsoft’s 1TB OneDrive plan costs only $6.99 per month and you get full access to the Office 365 suite of apps.\n\nGoogle is doing exactly what Apple should be doing\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, is doing exactly what Apple should be doing. People who buy Google’s new Pixel phones are given free unlimited Google Photos storage to host all their original photographs and 4k video. For Google it’s a fair trade, it gets to scrub your photos for anonymous data that will ultimately help it sell better ads, and Pixel owners never have to worry about seeing a \"storage is full\" message when uploading their imagery. Apple’s not making money from ads like Google, but it definitely wants the world to think iPhone when deciding what camera to buy next.\n\nDropbox comes close to Apple’s exorbitant pricing model but Dropbox is in the business of selling cloud storage. Even then, 1TB Dropbox Pro subscriptions cost $99.99 per year. Just think about that for a second; Apple charges more than Dropbox even though iCloud storage is a fundamental requirement for the features Apple promotes to help drive hardware sales. And in case it wasn’t obvious to you by now, Apple still makes its money by selling hardware.\n\nPricing limits the overall Apple experience\n\nIt’s bad enough that iCloud’s storage pricing hurts Apple’s most loyal customers — people who want to synchronize their data across multiple iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS devices and then share it with like-minded friends and family. But the pricing also inhibits new customers from experiencing Apple devices to their fullest potential because the owners are reluctant to pay for something they were told was free.\n\nIn fairness, Apple has been lowering its iCloud Storage rates over the years. Apple introduced the 1TB tier in September of 2014 for $19.99 per month which dropped to the current $9.99 rate in September of 2015. September 2016 has come and gone and all we got was a new $19.99 2TB tier. In other words, there's no reason to expect a discount anytime soon.\n\nAm I mad enough about my storage predicament to buy a new Pixel? No. But that new Google Home AI assistant sure looks appealing and it’s priced about the same as an annual 1TB iCloud storage subscription. And Google Home’s a gateway drug if I’ve ever seen one, that would certainly lead me to buy a Chromecast Ultra, and then a Google TV, and probably a Google Wifi, and then an Android…\n\nIs that really what you want Apple?", "Early this week, a search for “Marc Jacobs” in San Francisco generated links that included the brand’s official website and the designer’s Wikipedia page. It also fetched Mr. Jacobs’s latest Twitter posts and the location of a nearby doctor with the same name. During the coming fashion weeks, however, the same search is expected to generate photos from Mr. Jacobs’s show, messages from the designer about inspirations for his collection and behind-the-scenes videos of models and makeup artists preparing for the show. For brands on a see-now-buy-now show schedule, Google will allow people to shop for the latest looks directly from the search page.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLittle wonder Google, which teamed with the former Maxim editor and street style pioneer Kate Lanphear for the initiative, said it had signed more than 50 brands so far to the new search, including Marc Jacobs, Tom Ford, Christopher Kane, Prada, Burberry and Hermès.\n\nThis experimental approach is meant to allow users to hear directly from participants during major events, a company spokesman said. Google did this in January for a Republican presidential primary debate on Fox News. A search for “Fox News debate” yielded candidates’ own videos, answers to questions they weren’t asked and rebuttals.\n\nSince a Google search is often the first stop for people casually interested in a subject, this allows brands to “go front and center with the most aspirational vision of their products,” said Maureen Mullen, the chief strategy officer for L2, a research and advisory firm for consumer brands.\n\nNYT Living Newsletter Get lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use.

And what about Google?\n\nHaving designers play a role in what people see in searches “brings fashion week to life in a new way,” said Cameron McKnight, a product manager at Google. In theory, it allows creators to communicate their own visions more directly, rather than relying on third-party interpretation, be it from critics or retailers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut this approach calls into question the integrity of Google search results. What happens when what brands want on a search page conflicts with providing the best search results? Google said that brand results would only appear during fashion weeks, and would not affect the links summoned by the algorithmic search. “It will supplement the existing search results,” said Rami Banna, a Google product manager.\n\nAs for Google, special events like fashion weeks build a loyal and engaged audience, a must for advertisers. (Brands do not pay to participate in the initiative.) “For any of these platforms, it’s important to command the attention of fashion and luxury brands, because they are the ultimate arbiters of taste,” said Ms. Mullen of L2.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndeed, Google’s experiment will make the company competitive in wooing the fashion industry, pitting it against such platforms as Instagram, which has been particularly effective in casting itself as fashion’s friend.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKevin Systrom, Instagram’s co-founder and chief executive, is a regular on the fashion show circuit, attending Balmain’s show in Paris in October 2015 and Prada’s February 2016 show in Milan. His October 2015 wedding to Nicole Schuetz was even featured in Vogue. Last year, the company hired Eva Chen, the former editor of the style magazine Lucky, as the head of fashion partnerships. (Ms. Lanphear is Google’s answer to Ms. Chen.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Chen and her team work with models, designers and stylists, providing tips on the best ways to use Instagram. For example, she advises designers that a finished runway look shouldn’t be just one Instagram post; it could be five posts: the inspiration board, the different materials, the models getting ready, a slow-motion video of the models wearing the clothes, and the finished look.\n\nAs a result, L2 found that Instagram accounted for 97 percent of social media engagement (measured by likes and comments) during February’s fashion weeks.\n\nThe question now is, when researchers measure September’s social media engagement, will Google have changed all that?", "Google just announced that it has acquired FameBit, a marketplace that connects video creators with marketers who want to sponsor their content.\n\nThis could be an important step for Google’s YouTube, where monetization has been a big concern — not just for YouTube as a whole, but also for individual creators. YouTube has been working to provide more support on this front through its partner program, but we’ve also seen the growth of multi-channel networks that creators join up with for ad sales and business resources.\n\nBy acquiring FameBit, YouTube might look like it’s getting more competitive with those MCNs, but in a blog post, YouTube’s Ariel Bardin said that’s not the case:\n\n\n\nCreators will always have the choice in how they work with brands, and there are many great companies who provide this service today. This acquisition doesn’t change that. Our hope is that FameBit’s democratized marketplace will allow creators of all sizes to directly connect with brands, as well as provide a great technology solution for companies like MCNs and agencies to find matches for their creators and brand partners.\n\nFameBit was backed by Los Angeles startup studio Science, Inc. When I spoke to FameBit CEO David Kierzkowski last year, he said the marketplace is focused on “long- and mid-tail creators,” not just the big YouTube stars who get most of the attention from MCNs.\n\nIn today’s announcement, Kierzkowski and his co-founder Agnes Kozera said the platform has been used to 25,000 branded videos, and that FameBit will run as “a standalone operation” for now. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.", "People have made some pretty cool things in Google’s Tilt Brush VR painting app. But until now paintings made in Tilt Brush have pretty much been stuck in Tilt Brush, with no easy way to integrate those creations with other programs.\n\nThat changes today with Google’s open-source release of Tilt Brush Toolkit, which includes Python scripts and a Unity SDK for exporting Tilt Brush projects. Google is specifically highlighting the Unity integration, allowing users to use Tilt Brush sketches in Unity itself with the same materials, shaders, and even the audio responses from the Tilt Brush app. Developers will be able to use those 3D paintings in games, animations, and even other interactive content — essentially, anything that can be created with Unity will be able to use the Tilt Brush Toolkit integrations. Google has provided a list of ideas and details on how that will work with Unity in a helpful guide here, for developers looking to get started on new VR creations.\n\nThe Tilt Brush Toolkit is available now on GitHub.", "Information overload is a real problem these days. Internet trolling, fake news stories, information “echo chambers,” and the dark side of social media have headlined discussions on the future of politics and culture, particularly after the U.S. presidential elections. Perhaps no one is better suited to address this challenge than the man behind Google.\n\n“We, and I personally, believe very strongly that more information is better, even if it’s wrong,” said Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google’s parent company Alphabet, Inc.\n\n“Let’s start from the premise that more information, more empowerment, is fundamentally the correct answer” to the world’s most pressing challenges, Schmidt said Thursday after accepting Foreign Policy’s Diplomat of the Year award.\n\nGoogle is facing scrutiny in the aftermath of a presidential election season headlined by hacking, falsified news, trolling, and hateful rhetoric on the net. On Tuesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said fake news sites bankrolled by Google-served ads could have swung the election results in President-elect Donald Trump’s favor. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pushed back against similar accusations, saying it was “extremely unlikely” that his social media platform swayed the election, despite new findings indicating fake news performed better than real news on Facebook during the election.\n\nPichai said Google has already taken steps to confront the fake news phenomenon. “From our perspective, there should just be no situation where fake news gets distributed, so we are all for doing better here.”\n\nIn a discussion Thursday night with FP CEO and Editor David Rothkopf, Schmidt touted Google’s recent tests to combat trolling. “I’m absolutely convinced that these questions about validity, good information, bad information, will be sorted out,” he said. On trolling, Schmidt said “there’s a straightforward technological solution to an evil behavior. It’s easy to do, we did it, it can be replicated. And there’ll be more such solutions.” Google announced a new project to automatically fact-check news in ‘real time’ earlier Thursday.\n\nSchmidt also stressed the positive impact of information on the world. “It’s amazing how powerful the need for information is and how information-starved everyone is. So let’s start by celebrating…that we are busy empowering people in a way that is fundamentally different,” he said, citing the economic, educational, and security benefits a person in the developing world gains from just a cell phone.\n\nSchmidt joined awardees Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and Hafsat Abiola, founder of the Kudirat Initiative for Democracy (KIND) on stage at FP’s awards dinner. Tech talk wasn’t the event’s only agenda item. Climate change also dominated the evening’s discussion.\n\nHidalgo, receiving the Green Diplomat of the Year Award on behalf of C40 Cities, called climate change “the most important challenge humankind has ever had to face.” In December 2015, a landmark international climate change deal was brokered in Hidalgo’s city. Now that deal may be under threat as Trump, a vocal skeptic of climate change, steps into the Oval Office.\n\n“Climate change is not just a bad movie or a bad reality show,” Hidalgo said, a tacit poke at the real estate mogul and reality TV star who just won the U.S. presidency.\n\nAmid talks of cyber war, fake news, and climate change, Abiola gave a message of hope and optimism at FP’s dinner when she received the Citizen Diplomat of the Year award.\n\n“What we hope depends on who is in our corner,” Abiola said, speaking of the optimism she shares for the future of her native Nigeria and the United States, despite the reality of each country’s political challenges. “The distance between hope and reality is partnership, collaboration, solidarity,” she said.", "Condemnation leads to outrage about Google ‘removing’ country from map – but the country has never been labelled on the mapping service\n\nGoogle has been accused of deleting Palestine from Google Maps – but the truth is, it was never labelled by Google in the first place.\n\nWhen searching for Palestine on Google Maps, it shows an outline, but with no label for Palestine and Israel labelled alongside it. While 136 members of the United Nations recognise Palestine as an independent state, the US and much of the west does not.\n\nThe representation of Palestine on Google Maps has not changed recently, but after the forum of Palestinian journalists released a statement condemning Google, word spread via social media and later news outlets. People began sharing their outrage using the hashtag #PalestineIsHere.\n\nTalbia Akbar Khan (@talbiaakbar) Removing #Palestine from the map doesn't mean it ceases to exist. #PalestineIsHere pic.twitter.com/uQfIDcJOka\n\nFatih Yağcı (@FatihYagciResmi) Shame on you @google ! How dare you to support Israil and erase Palestine from @googlemaps ! #PalestineIsHere\n\nA Google spokeswoman said: “There has never been a ‘Palestine’ label on Google Maps, however we discovered a bug that removed the labels for ‘West Bank’ and ‘Gaza Strip’. We’re working quickly to bring these labels back to the area.”\n\nA petition from March this year urging Google to include Palestine on their maps has gained traction in the last few days, now with almost 250,000 signatures.\n\n\n\nWhile nothing has changed, the online outrage has pointed to questions about how mapping technologies affect people’s understanding of the world. The Washington Post’s Caitlyn Dewey wrote:\n\nIn their attempts to dispassionately document the physical world online, tech companies often end up shaping our understanding of it, too. That’s not something that we tend to think about often, but it does become pretty obvious when a map changes/is said to have changed, or when we compare different maps against each other.\n\nThis is not the first time Google has got into hot water over disputed territories – and it’s likely not to be the last. A 2014 project called Disputed Territories documented how Google Maps attempts to stay out of geographical disputes and issues of national identity.\n\nFor example: users in Russia see a solid boundary line around Russia and Crimea. Outside of Russia, Crimea is surrounded by dashed lines, indicating it as occupied territory.", "Think streaming music, and the first name that springs to mind is probably Spotify—but there are some great alternatives out there. Both Apple and Google have music services for streaming, downloads, and playing local files across phones, tablets, and desktop. There are lots of different ways to compare the two services, but we’re going to try and simplify it by starting with all the similarities. Here’s how Apple Music compares to Google Play Music.\n\nThe head-to-head comparison\n\nIn a lot of ways, Apple Music and Google Play Music cover a lot of the same ground. They both work on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows, and both let you manage local or purchased music for free. They also have an option to pay $9.99 a month for access to a streaming catalog of about 35 million songs.\n\n\n\nAll the major features are covered on both services: music recommendations, podcasts, radio mixes, and offline listening on mobile. Apple Music emphasizes human rather than algorithm-led curation for music recommendations, but the end result is practically the same. Both also let you build and share playlists, as well as love (or like) tracks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple Music runs through iTunes, of course, with a cloud element added on top via the iCloud Music Library; Google Play Music is completely web-based, with mobile apps and the option to monitor local folders for file uploads.\n\nThere are difference in each feature set, but the competition is neck-and-neck when it comes to all the big features we use on a daily basis. That means look and feel is very important when it comes to deciding which suits you best. It’s also the hardest part to talk about objectively, because everyone’s tastes vary.\n\nThe same rules that apply for iOS vs Android apply here: Apple Music is detailed and elegant (and perhaps too complicated), whereas Google Play Music is bright and bold (and perhaps too simple). Apple Music follows the iTunes aesthetic whereas Google Play Music follows the principles of material design, dominated by that big search box.\n\nWhy you might prefer Apple Music\n\nIf you have a lot of Apple hardware or if you’ve grown up with iTunes , Apple Music is probably your best option. One or two of the biggest names in music have also released exclusives on Apple Music in the past—albeit for brief periods. Still, it’s something that we haven’t really seen much of to date with Google Play Music.\n\nSponsored\n\nAs clunky and complex as it is, iTunes does offer cool features like smart playlists, unlike the Google Play Music web app (at least not natively). If you want to queue up all the songs you haven’t heard in a month, or all the five-star tracks you’ve got from the 80s, then Apple Music is the service for you.\n\nBeats 1—the 24/7, celebrity-packed, hand-curated radio station broadcasting around the world—is something else Apple Music has and Google Play Music doesn’t. You might love it or loathe it, but unlike the streaming component of Apple Music, you can at least try it out for free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe “For You” recommendation pane is more comprehensive and seems to be more intelligent than Google’s comparable offering. Plus, you get the Connect social element (where artists share social updates with fans), though this seems to be going the same way as Ping.\n\nWhy you might prefer Google Play Music\n\nBeing able to upload 50,000 of your own MP3s to the cloud, free of charge, so you can access them from anywhere, is a huge plus—though note that Google does an iTunes Match-style trick, so it stores its own copies of the songs if it can find them. Be careful when uploading your rarities and b-sides to be sure Play Music stores the right versions.\n\niCloud Music Library, by comparison, offers space for 100,000 songs—as long as you’re paying for iTunes Match or Apple Music. Google’s uploading is all done for free, whether or not you subscribe, and it’s also DRM-free.\n\nThe web-only approach will be a benefit to some and a drawback for others. You can get at your library from any web browser, but you do need web access. You don’t need to worry about where your vast iTunes library is, just whether or not you can get online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle Play Music doesn’t have Beats, but it does have playlists based around moods and times of day, if you’re stuck for inspiration. A monthly subscription also gets you YouTube Red—ad-free, offline-enabled YouTube, with all the extra bells and whistles that come along with it (exclusive PewDiePie videos!).\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWe’ve talked about the (many) similarities and (few) differences between Apple Music and Google Play Music, but head-to-head comparisons will only get you so far in a personal choice like this. If you’re a seasoned iTunes user, you’re going to be much more comfortable with Apple Music, whereas if you’re completely new to iTunes, you’re probably going to find Google Play Music much more enjoyable to use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle Play Music lives on the web, for better or worse, whereas Apple Music links back to the old days (2003-2015) of digital downloads. That, maybe together with Beats 1 and YouTube Red, are these two services in a nutshell, so proceed accordingly.\n\nIf you really want to work out which one suits you best, then maybe shell out the $19.98 for a month and try them both. You’ll probably come across a host of little annoyances or delights that will help sway you one way or the other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere’s no real comprehensive winner here. If you’re got a Chromebook, go for Google Play Music. If you already have a carefully cultivated iTunes library of 25,000 songs, go for Apple Music. If you use a Sonos setup at home, well, you can choose either.", "When you use Google, you are making a deal. You get to use services like Gmail, Drive, search, YouTube, and Google Maps for free.

The video went viral, with an abridged version of it being viewed over 25 million times on Facebook.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nEpstein set out with his colleagues at the American Institute for Behavioral Research (AIBRT) to investigate the claims. They concluded that whilst the investigation is ongoing, their report “generally supports” Lieberman’s video.\n\nIn order to test the results, Epstein and his associates tested hundreds of different response terms related to the election, using Yahoo and Bing search as a control. Each search was also conducted through proxy servers, such as the Tor network, to make it very difficult for Google to identify the researchers and thus customize the search results for them.\n\nIt is somewhat difficult to get the Google search bar to suggest negative searches related to Mrs. Clinton or to make any Clinton-related suggestions when one types a negative search term. Bing and Yahoo, on the other hand, often show a number of negative suggestions in response to the same search terms. Bing and Yahoo seem to be showing us what people are actually searching for; Google is showing us something else — but what, and for what purpose? As for Google Trends, as Lieberman reported, Google indeed withholds negative search terms for Mrs. Clinton even when such terms show high popularity in Trends. We have also found that Google often suggests positive search terms for Mrs. Clinton even when such terms are nearly invisible in Trends. The widely held belief, reinforced by Google’s own documentation, that Google’s search suggestions are based on “what other people are searching for” seems to be untrue in many instances. Google tries to explain away such findings by saying its search bar is programmed to avoid suggesting searches that portray people in a negative light. As far as we can tell, this claim is false; Google suppresses negative suggestions selectively, not across the board. It is easy to get autocomplete to suggest negative searches related to prominent people, one of whom happens to be Mrs. Clinton’s opponent.\n\nEpstein attached screenshots of some of the searches he conducted, clearly showing a lack of negative results for Clinton, in contrast to negative search results for rival Donald Trump. It was also not a case of people simply not searching for these terms on Google — Google Trends shows the search rates between the relevant keywords, with negative Hillary results usually trending higher.\n\nMoreover, Epstein suggests that these autocomplete results will have a dramatic effect on the election itself.\n\nOver time, differentially suppressing negative search suggestions will repeatedly expose millions of people to far more positive search results for one political candidate than for the other. Research I have been conducting since 2013 with Ronald Robertson of Northeastern University has shown that high-ranking search results that favor one candidate can easily shift 20 percent or more of undecided voters toward that candidate — up to 80 percent in some demographic groups, as I noted earlier. This is because of the enormous trust people have in computer-generated search results, which people mistakenly believe are completely impartial and objective — just as they mistakenly believe search suggestions are completely impartial and objective. Perhaps you are skeptical about my claims. Perhaps you are also not seeing, on balance, a pro-Hillary bias in the search suggestions you receive on your computer. Perhaps you are also not concerned about the possibility that search suggestions can be used systematically to nudge people’s searches in one direction or another. If you are skeptical in any or all of these ways, ask yourself this: Why, to begin with, is Google censoring its search suggestions? (And it certainly acknowledges doing so.) Why doesn’t it just show us, say, the top ten most popular searches related to whatever we are typing? Why, in particular, is it suppressing negative information? Are Google’s leaders afraid we will have panic attacks and sue the company if we are directed to dark and disturbing web pages? Do they not trust us to make up our own minds about things? Do they think we are children? Without whistleblowers or warrants, no one can prove Google executives are using digital shenanigans to influence elections, but I don’t see how we can rule out that possibility. There is nothing illegal about manipulating people using search suggestions and search rankings — quite the contrary, in fact — and it makes good financial sense for a company to use every legal means at its disposal to support its preferred candidates.\n\nIn a postscript, Epstein reveals that he is, in fact, a Clinton supporter himself, but concludes that he does not believe it would be “right for her to win the presidency because of the invisible, large-scale manipulations of a private company. That would make democracy meaningless.”\n\nYou can read his full report here.\n\nJack Hadfield is a student at the University of Warwick and a regular contributor to Breitbart Tech.

Not the four that Google seems to think you do. At Google I/O, the Internet giant's annual conference for developers, Google unwrapped two new, very distinct messenger apps that will work on iOS and Android phones \"this summer.\" There's Allo, for messages and emojis, and Duo for videoconferencing. This is already on top of Google Messenger and Hangouts, each of which handles both texts and video calls.\n\nWhat gives, Google? Do we really need all these messaging apps?\n\nGoogle says we do. Allo and Duo are both apps that Google built from scratch, not based on any existing code for Hangouts or Messenger. And both new communication apps draw deeply on machine learning as part of the artificial intelligence future that CEO Sundar Pichai champions as the way forward.\n\n2:23 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF\n\nAllo's goal is to learn your rhythms and responses and offer suggestions in the form of quick replies. So if someone asks, \"How're you doing?\" the app might suggest you type in \"Awesome!\" alongside an emoji of dog doodoo. You choose the suggestion you want, or respond with something else, and behind the scenes Allo records and remembers your answer, maybe for next time.\n\nDuo's flashiest video-calling trick is Knock-Knock, which essentially rings your buddy with a preview of what you look like and what you're doing this very minute. That means there can be no delays between broadcasting your goings-on and the moment the person on the other end receives the knock and picks up the call (or not).\n\nAllo and Duo work as they do, Google says, because the programs stand on their own; they're light and finely tuned, not burdened by too many features that do other things.\n\n\"We didn't want to weigh down the [engineering] team with decisions from previous products,\" Erik Kay, Google's engineering director for communication software, told CNET. Because coders were given the freedom to create from the ground up, Google said, they were able to concentrate on fresh, innovative ways to make next-gen talking tools.\n\nFocused engineering may be Google's reason for keeping the two separate, but there are other considerations as well. These apps work on phones and tether to your phone number, whereas Hangouts is purposely cross-platform, so it works on desktops as nimbly as it does on mobile.\n\nGoogle also says that different consumers use apps for different purposes, so you might turn to Hangouts for a certain group of friends and Facebook Messenger for another. Meanwhile, you might Skype your in-laws on the weekend but call up Duo's Knock-Knock video to chat with your sweetheart.\n\n\n\nMaybe this is the behavior that winds up happening, but is it what we really want? I don't. I already use Hangouts and Facebook Messenger, texting, WeChat, What'sApp, Skype Messenger, Slack (for work) and sometimes even Twitter. (There's also Kik, Peach, Snapchat, and good ol' Yahoo Messenger too, of course.)\n\nFor my life, the plethora of messaging apps is simply too many. All these messengers are exhausting to juggle, and I'm constantly missing messages that slip through the cracks; notifications are easy to miss if I put aside my phone for awhile. Can this helter-skelter multiple-messenger monitoring really be what Google wants? Or is a simpler scenario, where one chat app reigns, the preferable path? (WhatsApp, for instance, tends to rule the roost in Europe, while WeChat dominates in Asia.)\n\nWith Allo, Duo, Hangouts and Messenger, Google is certainly in a position to snatch the messaging space from four corners, and could do it too. But it's more likely that Allo and Duo are Google's real investment for the future, with Hangouts and Messenger hedging those bets. Google is probably throwing Allo and Duo at the wall to see what sticks; then it'll strategize next steps from there.", "Pixel XL, the first made-by-Google phablet, has earned big accolades for its camera, super-swift performance and pure Android experience. Still, it's an expensive phone, and not all of its features are necessities. How does it compare to one of our favorite bargain 'droids, the OnePlus 3?\n\nSize\n\nOnly the Pixel is XL in name, but both phones could be considered such. The OnePlus 3 is smaller, but only by 1-2 millimeters in each dimension. When it comes to thickness, there's only a tenth of a millimeter's difference.\n\nWeight\n\nThe slightly smaller OnePlus is 6-percent lighter.\n\nBuild\n\nBoth phones have an industry-standard aluminum unibody. The Pixel XL also has a glass accent (read: a breakable portion) on its upper back.\n\nWater resistance\n\nMany of this year's flagships boast a significant water resistance rating, but not these two.\n\nColors\n\nThe Pixel has more color options, including blue, which is the most vivid option of the bunch. Otherwise, we're looking at the typical array of neutrals and metallics.\n\nDisplay size\n\nThe two displays match in size, which means the OnePlus 3 has a slightly better screen-to-size ratio.\n\nDisplay resolution\n\nThe Pixel lives up to its name by packing a lot more pixels into its screen space. Side by side, it makes a noticeable difference.\n\nDisplay type\n\nBoth of these devices opt for AMOLED technology over IPS displays.\n\nPressure-sensitive display\n\nNeither of these phones have any equivalent to the 3D Touch display technology that's been in iPhones for a couple of years now. However, Apple hasn't exactly convinced the masses of its utility, so you probably won't miss it.\n\nCamera megapixels\n\nIn the rear camera, the OnePlus 3 wins the megapixel war. But when the pixel counts are already that high (and there are so many other factors that affect camera performance), it's not the most telling spec. The front cameras have a matching 8 megapixels, which should yield some of the sharpest selfies out there.\n\nCamera aperture (rear)\n\nTypically, larger camera apertures on smartphones mean better pictures in low-light conditions. Both of these have a decent f/2.0 aperture. That being said, the Pixel XL has the best low-light photography we've seen from a phone, due to its unique processing algorithms.\n\nOptical image stabilization (OIS)\n\nOn paper, Pixel XL's lack of OIS seems like a glaring omission, but again, you won't miss it. In practice, the Pixel's camera is excellent.\n\nBattery capacity\n\nPixel XL's battery has a larger capacity. According to Google, it will get up to 14 hours of internet use or video playback. OnePlus hasn't released official battery life estimates, but it did fare slightly better in our tests: Pixel XL's battery life dropped 11-percent and OnePlus 3's dropped 9-percent in our standard video streaming test.\n\nCharging/data port\n\nNothing proprietary or old-school here. Both of these devices charge via reversible USB-C ports.\n\nFast charging\n\nAnother shared convenience: Both phones rise from the dead quickly, thanks to fast charging.\n\nWireless charging\n\nThere aren't any wireless options for charging these two, but the Pixels do ship with generous charging options: USB-C wall adapter, doubled-ended USB-C cord, USB-A to USB-C cord, and a USB-A to USB-C adapter. You shouldn't have any trouble figuring out a way to charge it, regardless of your setup.\n\nProcessor\n\nThe newer Snapdragon 821 in the Pixel XL may be better for gaming and other demanding applications.\n\nRAM\n\nThe OnePlus 3 has more RAM, but for what it's worth, our experiences with the Pixel and Pixel XL indicate that it's lightning-quick.\n\nInternal storage\n\nThe Pixel XL is available with either 32 GB or 128 GB of built-in storage. The OnePlus 3 has an option, an intermediary 64 GB size.\n\nmicroSD\n\n... and you'll have to make do with internal storage on either one. Neither of these phones have microSD slots for expandable storage.\n\nVR-ready\n\nOnePlus 3 is not VR-ready (unless you count low-end Google Cardboard setups), but the Pixel XL is a natural partner for Daydream, Google's new virtual reality headset. Its newer processor and high-resolution display should come in handy for this purpose.\n\nHeadphone jack\n\nDon't be concerned about connecting to your favorite headphones. So far, only Apple has nixed the headphone jack.\n\nHome button type\n\nThe Pixel's home, back and recent apps buttons take up a sliver of onscreen real estate. OnePlus 3 has a physical off-screen home button beneath the display.\n\nFingerprint sensor\n\nThe Pixel's fingerprint sensor is on its upper back. On the OnePlus 3, it's incorporated into the home button.\n\nMobile payments\n\nBoth phones are NFC (near-field communication) equipped, so Android Pay works on either one.\n\nVirtual assistant\n\nPixel and Pixel XL are the first phones to have Google Assistant, an answer to Siri and a grown-up version of Google Now. We talked about the Assistant vs. Siri experience in our Pixel review.\n\nNetwork compatibility\n\nBoth phones ship unlocked, but the OnePlus 3 is not compatible with CDMA networks. In the US, that means it's a no-go on Verizon or Sprint.\n\nOperating system\n\nAs the first made-by-Google phone, Pixel is first in line for all Android updates, at least for the next two years. It currently runs the latest version of Nougat. OnePlus 3 is still running Android Marshmallow, with no official word on when an update will take place.\n\nRelease\n\nOnePlus 3 launched four months earlier than the first Google-branded phones.\n\nStarting price (full retail)\n\nNow there's a staggering difference. The Pixel XL costs nearly US$400 more, almost twice the price of the OnePlus 3. Of course, those extra bills get you a superior camera (perhaps the best), VR capability and a beautifully showcased Android experience. Still, the OnePlus 3 is no slouch. It offers several high-end features for a bargain price, as long as network problems and having to put down the entire cost up front (since it isn't available through any carriers) isn't a deal breaker for you.\n\nRead our long-form reviews of the Pixel XL and OnePlus 3 for more in-depth information.", "Google has just disclosed that it has snatched up the team behind API.AI. API.AI provides tools to developers to help them build conversational, Siri-esque bots.\n\nAs humans, we’re pretty good at communication. If someone says “the girl saw a man with the binoculars,” we can generally use contextual clues to figure out if they meant that the girl saw the man by using binoculars, or saw a man who was carrying binoculars.\n\nTeaching a robot to do the same is a bigger challenge. Add in ambiguity (by “get me a lift” do you mean any old car, or a Lyft, specifically?) and there’s an endless number of ways to say pretty much any one thing… and, well, the challenge becomes huge.\n\nAPI.AI helps developers who are building bots tackle this by providing them with tools to keep them from endlessly reinventing the wheel. Their APIs handle things like speech recognition, intent recognition and context management, and allows devs to provide domain-specific knowledge (like that “deep dish” and “Chicago-style” can probably mean the same thing to your pizza delivery bot) that might be unique to your bot’s needs.\n\nAPI.AI currently plays friendly with 15 languages/dialects, including English, Chinese, French, German and Spanish.\n\nAccording to a running counter on its homepage, API.AI has processed a little over 3 billion API requests to date. Meanwhile, Google says over 60,000 developers have built stuff with API.AI’s toolset.\n\nThe price and terms of the acquisition have not been disclosed yet, but API.AI had raised around $8.6 million to date according to Crunchbase.", "Google admitted their software had been udderly ‘overzealous’, but didn’t begrudge cow for milking its newfound fame\n\nWe are used to faces and number plates being obscured by Google to protect privacy for images on Street View, but animals don’t often suffer the same fate – except for this Cambridge cow.\n\nThe picture, which was taken last summer at Coe Fen, was spotted by the Guardian’s US opinion editor David Shariatmadari.\n\nDavid Shariatmadari (@D_Shariatmadari) Great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously pic.twitter.com/ACTBpDwno6\n\nAlthough the cow can be seen in all its bovine glory in one image near the river Cam, Google appears to have blurred it for a tighter crop.\n\nThe search giant admitted its technology may have been a little overeager.\n\nA spokesperson for Google told the BBC: “We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it’s clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous.

After all, why would the plans of AI scientists be of interest to Starcraft 2 players? As it turns out, if the collaboration between DeepMind and Blizzard is what its developers hope it could be, players will see very tangible benefits—and so will many others outside the video game space.\n\nAI has been an integral part of video games for quite some time now, and as Starcraft 2’s executive producer Chris Sigaty points out, the AI that DeepMind hopes to develop won’t be the first to play the Blizzard RTS. Currently the games uses a scripted AI. It's created by a team of designers and engineers that have an understanding of the way the game plays, with their expertise placed into a script and fed a list of conditions. For example, if X amount of resources is collected, the AI should spend the value of Y on Z units.\n\n\"They’re elaborate and interesting to play against; there’s some random choice and specific choices that happen,\" says Sigaty. \"They can expand on their terrain, gather resources—basically do the things you need to do in Starcraft 2. But these [AI] are scripted. They’re predictable and ultimately, unless it cheats, there’s not an AI out there who can beat a human.\"\n\nThis holds true for Starcraft 2—the best e-sports players routinely beat AI opponents. The aim DeepMind is to develop an AI that plays the game the same way as a human, potentially one that can beat the best players, which widens the potential for deep learning. And the DeepMind team has already had some success in the gaming field: in March this year, the team’s AI AlphaGo saw off the world-class Go player Lee Sedol in a best-of-five series that it won 4-1—leaping what was a major hurdle for AIs in the past.\n\nIt's not (just) a game\n\nOriol Vinyals, one of the research scientists at DeepMind, says that Starcraft 2 may help AI research take a massive step forward, because a game in which pieces (or in this case units) aren’t static and movement isn’t turn-based helps create a better benchmark for AI development.\n\n\"We feel that the complexity of Starcraft 2 enables us to now start testing algorithms that perhaps some years ago we were not ready to tackle,\" he says.\n\nIn Starcraft 2, much of the information a player needs to succeed in a match is initially hidden, and players are required to scout terrain while managing resources and building units in order to ascertain their opponent’s position. Static AI views the movement on the board as parcels of data, and in order for DeepMind to use Starcraft 2 as a learning experience, that data has to be kept hidden—in much the same way it would be for a human player.\n\n\"The process is more complex because the game hides units and players don’t know where the enemy is. It focuses on planning and resource management and then players have to factor in whether they’ve played their opponent before, and how they approach them with this knowledge,\" says Vinyals.\n\n\"These are all very critical AI challenges that we’ll be able to tackle with this new environment. Crucially, even if it isn’t immediately successful, you can start building benchmarks with how it performs, which allows us to keep pushing the envelope on the state-of-the-art which is great. Again, by making it open, everyone can add their ideas to help with the process.\"\n\nThe collaboration between Blizzard and DeepMind isn’t a closed shop. As part of the announcement at the BlizzCon keynote, Vinyals said that Starcraft 2’s AI research environment would be open to any developers, hobbyists, or players who wanted to get involved. DeepMind is putting out the call in a global sense because it needs the world at large to help with this huge challenge. The API is planned for release as a patch for the game in the first quarter of 2017, and will be available to players as part of the free Starter Edition. But, as Vinyals notes, there is a lot of work to be done ahead of the launch.\n\n\"The collaboration started very recently,\" he says. \"The first step is to build the environment, which allows us to place our [AI] agent in it and have it start to make observations while playing. We’re focused totally on building that environment because we have to release it to the public; it has to be a benchmark for other AI researchers as well. There are many people researching AI so making sure that environment is something they can all use is very important.\"\n\n“The next step would be introducing the agent. We haven't tackled that yet except on a simplistic level.”\n\nListing image by Oli Scarff/Getty Images", "Earlier this year, Steve McCarroll announced that his team had discovered the gene that most powerfully drives our risk of schizophrenia. Known as C4, it was previously viewed as an immune-system gene, but clearly, it also does something in the brain. To work out what, McCarroll first needed to know which cells in the brain activate C4. Easier said than done: “There’s no place for looking that up,” he says. Instead, his team had to examine slices from over 700 postmortem brains, and stain them with a dozen different-colored antibodies that recognize C4. “The slices were variable in quality. The antibodies were variable in quality. It took us almost a year to get satisfying answers. It was a slog.” McCarroll’s lament is a common one. Geneticists are constantly learning about genes that influence our risk of disease, but genes don’t perform in a vacuum. They perform in our cells. And since the 30 trillion cells in your body all share the same genes, you need to know which cells are actually using the gene in question. Where are those cells? What do they do normally, and what goes wrong in cases of disease? And in most cases, without the kind of slog that McCarroll endured, the answers are: we don’t know; no idea; and, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.\n\nWithout such answers, a lot of the hype around biomedical advances becomes wishful thinking. With stem cells, scientists hope to re-grow damaged or lost tissues, but how do we regenerate something when we don’t entirely know what it’s composed of? With gene-editing techniques like CRISPR, we will supposedly hack diseases out of our DNA, but without deep knowledge of our cells, how do we know what to edit? Our cells are the basic unit of our bodies—the stage upon which our genes enact their dramas. And simply put, “we really don’t know our cells.” says Aviv Regev from the Broad Institute. “And so we don’t know ourselves.” Consider this fairly basic question: How many types of cells are there in the body? Around 200, according to several introductory pages from the National Institutes of Health. That figure corresponds to major groups, like neurons, heart cells, muscle cells, and more. But if you ask an immunologist, they’ll tell you there are at least 200 types of immune cells alone. Ask an immunologist who specializes in T-cells, and they’ll tell you there are at least 200 of those. When I met Regev last year, she spent a good 15 minutes talking about all the variations within our cells. There are subtypes upon subtypes upon subtypes, she said. The retina alone contains at least 100 different classes of neurons. To complicate matters, some types of cells can transform into others. And each subtype can exist in many different states based on its environment, its neighbors, its position in a tissue, and the molecules it encounters.\n\n\"All of these things, the type and the subtype, the states, the locations, and the transitions … you’d want to know all of them,\" Regev told me. She let her words hang, and she smiled gently. Because she had a plan to do exactly that: to know everything. Over the last few years, Regev has been slowly laying the foundations for compiling a Human Cell Atlas—a complete portrait of our cells in all their staggering diversity. It would list every subtype, how they change over time, where they are found, and which genes they switch on. Much like the first fully-sequenced human genome, it would be a resource so fundamental that biologists will use it many times a day without even thinking about it—a comprehensive, searchable Google Maps for the human body. Creating such a resource is ambitious to say the least, and would have seemed impossible just five years ago. But thanks to technological advances, Regev and others think that the time is right. “The idea has been bubbling,” says Sarah Teichmann from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. “I had talked with someone about this four years ago. At the time, it seemed a bit crazy. Even now, it seems crazy—but also more feasible. And people are willing to consider it.” That’s partly due to Regev, who has been evangelizing for the atlas since 2014. She is widely respected, and not just for her boundless energy and fierce intellect. “She’s one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, but also intense, perceptive, compassionate and caring,” says Dana Pe’er from Columbia University.\n\nCase in point: Last June, at a meeting, Regev noticed that Pe’er was suffering from back pain, surreptitiously emailed her to ask if she was okay, and texted a colleague to bring in a more comfortable chair—all while leading a debate between big-name scientists and summarizing their discussion in real time. “The people sitting right next to me didn’t notice a thing,” says Pe’er. “Aviv did, from the other side of the room with a bad field of view.” Yesterday, in London, Regev and Teichmann convened another meeting of like-minded scientists who were interested in their vision of a cell atlas. The event was effectively a soft launch—not of the atlas itself, but of a budding community that will actually start making it happen. They already have a funding commitment from the Chan-Zuckeberg Initiative—the recently formed company that is aiming to “cure, prevent or manage all disease by the end of this century.” “The Human Cell Atlas would be a transformative technology that advances all of science,” CZI President Cori Bargmann told the assembled researchers. “We’re pretty much on board with saying that this should happen, and we want to help make it happen with the people in this room.” “It was as if we thought that everyone in a city wore green shirts, and it turned out that some wore blue and some wore yellow.” As is often the way in science, Regev’s dream for the Human Cell Atlas began with a simple surprise.\n\nWhen scientists study cells, they typically smoosh a large population of them together. They get a clear portrait of an average cell, but they whitewash all the diversity within the group. To unveil that diversity, Regev and others had been developing hardware and software for studying single cells. She first turned those tools onto a group of immune cells called dendritic cells back in 2012, isolating just 18 of these cells and cataloguing all the genes that they were activating. “We were immediately astounded,” she says. It turned out that 3 of those 18 cells were switching on very different sets of genes than the others. What was supposedly a pure sample of identical cells turned out to be a pool of two distinct types. “It was as if we thought that everyone in a city wore green shirts, and it turned out that some wore blue and some wore yellow.” She repeated the study with over 1,700 dendritic cells, and found even more variation. Dendritic cells are watchmen: they grab molecules that could be signs of infectious threats, and present those molecules to the rest of the immune system for inspection. But in response to the same molecules, seemingly identical cells would react by switching on different genes. Some did so much earlier than others, and then instigated the responses of their more apathetic neighbors. These experiments showed Regev how much she and other scientists were missing. “All of these years, when we did these studies, we would grow millions of cells in a dish and pretend they were one,” she says. “We’d take these average measurements and say: A cell! We knew that wasn’t correct, but you work with what you have.”\n\nBut technology has changed, in both power and affordability. It cost Regev thousands of dollars to analyze just those 18 dendritic cells in 2012. By 2013, with some robotics, she had taken the price down to ten bucks a cell. McCarroll, who also works at the Broad Institute, pushed the cost down even further. He and his team developed a technique called DropSeq, which sends cells down extremely narrow canals, single file, and incarcerates them in droplets of oil. Each oily cage is a millionth of a milliliter in volume, and contains precisely one prisoner. Once in solitary confinement, the cells can be split open and their DNA can be sequenced. So can their RNA—a related molecule that reveals which genes are being switched on. With DropSeq, Regev and McCarroll can simultaneously study hundreds of thousands of single cells, at just 6 cents each. They can start doing the work it would take to actually build a Human Cell Atlas in a cost-effective way. “Aviv has been pushing the cutting edge to do things that almost seem impossible, and she's made unbelievable ground in a very short period of time,” adds Pe’er. “I didn't think it could be done that fast.” “At first people will say it’s impossible. Later, they’ll say it was obvious.” The Human Cell Atlas isn't just an academic cataloguing exercise. It might be the key to making the promises of biomedicine real. When geneticists identify genes behind diseases, they want to understand where those genes are active. When immunologists engineer cells to attack cancers based on the molecules on their surface, they'd better know whether healthy cells somewhere in the body naturally harbor those same molecules. And when tissue engineers dream of growing new organs in a lab, they need to know if what they're producing actually matches their natural counterparts.\n\nThe Human Cell Atlas isn’t going to reveal everything about our bodies, just as the Human Genome Project didn’t tell us everything about our genes. But it should provide a foundational resource—something that spurs countless future experiments and makes those experiments easier. “Think of what having the genome has done for biology: We can find genes that cause disease, and sequence tumors, and personalize medicine,” says Pe’er. “I think the Human Cell Atlas would have the same impact. And we need it to make sense of our genome.” It might also help scientists to make more use of finished research. Researchers have already sequenced the DNA of countless tissue samples, taken from people with cancer and all kinds of other conditions. Regev can look at those sequences and, with a few computational tricks, reverse-engineer which types of cells were present. She has already tried this with melanoma skin cancers. “We can say this tumor pretty much only had malignant cells, or this one had a lot of immune cells,” she says. “There’s so much hidden there that we don’t yet know.” That might help cancer biologists to better classify tumors into distinct types, and develop more effective tailor treatments—all without collecting anything new. “These samples come from people who had diseases,” she adds. “We owe them and the taxpayers to learn the maximum amount we can.” Skeptics might argue that tech aside, the Human Cell Atlas is still implausible. The Human Genome Project had an obvious endpoint—produce a near-complete genome. But cataloguing our cells seems like fighting a Hydra—find one subtype and two more rise to take its place. Regev thinks otherwise. “Is every cell going to be its own special snowflake? I would say not,” she says. “They group into stable categories.”", "Behind the clean and tidy interface sported by Google’s online office apps, there are all kinds of features and tools you might not yet have stumbled across—and some of them can seriously improve your productivity. Here are 18 of our favorite quick tricks that won’t take long to learn but which will come in handy time and time again.\n\n\n\n1) Add words to the dictionary\n\nIf you’re tired of always seeing your company’s strangely spelled name appear with a red line underneath it, click Tools then Personal dictionary to tell Google Docs to ignore it in the future.\n\n\n\n2) Paste formats inside documents\n\nOne of the most useful features added to Google Docs recently is the Paint format icon, which you can see to the left of the zoom indicator (it looks like a paint roller). Highlight some text, click the icon, then highlight some more text to copy the styling over.\n\n\n\n3) Tag someone in a comment\n\nAdding comments is all well and good (and very easy in Google Docs), but how can you be sure someone else has seen them? If you type the plus (“+”) symbol in a comment, followed by an email address, that person gets an alert telling them they’ve been tagged.\n\n\n\n4) Manage long documents with bookmarks\n\nGoogle Docs lets you put markers down inside documents so you can more easily find your way around big files. Go to Insert then Bookmark to place one and get the link to it. Use Insert and Link to link to your bookmarks (if you’re building a table of contents, say).\n\n\n\n5) Get started quickly with templates\n\nEarlier this year Google added a bunch of fancy new templates to Drive, but depending on how you use the online apps you might not have seen them. Head to the landing pages for Docs, Sheets or Slides to get a look at the templates available to base your work around.\n\n\n\n6) Link between documents\n\nDid you know when placing hyperlinks inside documents you can link to other files in Google Drive as well as external websites? Click the link button on the toolbar, then instead of pasting a web URL, type out the name of the document you want to link to.\n\n\n\n7) Put images inside spreadsheet cells\n\nType “=image(“URL”) into any cell inside Sheets to drop a picture inside the cell itself. Add a number (e.g. “=image(“URL”, 1)) for formatting: 1 is image scaled, 2 is image stretched, 3 is keep the original size and 4 is custom size (so “image(“URL”, 4, 1600, 900) for example).\n\n\n\n8) Quickly fill a cell series\n\nYou can save yourself a lot of typing by letting Sheets do the work for you. Highlight the first cells in a column containing a series (such as days of the week or successive numbers), then drag down the blue handle in the bottom right corner to continue it.\n\n\n\n9) Go back to earlier versions\n\nFor those times when undo doesn’t cut it, you can roll back to earlier versions of any type of document with the help of the See revision history entry on the File menu. At the foot of the revision list you can show or hide changes, and see a more detailed log of edits.\n\n\n\n10) Put line breaks inside a spreadsheet cell\n\nGoogle Sheets isn’t necessarily the best place for your advanced text layouts, but there are a few tricks worth knowing if you are dropping text in alongside your numbers. One of them is the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Enter (or Cmd+Enter) which inserts a line break.\n\n\n\n11) Do some quick number crunching\n\nHighlight a series of cells in Sheets and down in the lower right-hand corner of your spreadsheet you’ll see the total figure has been added up for you—click on the sum total and you can quickly get the average, count, and maximum and minimum values too.\n\n\n\n12) Save charts as images\n\nGot a winning chart you just can’t wait to share with the world? If you’re emailing someone or preparing a presentation then an image might work better than a Sheets link. Click the drop-down menu inside the chart itself then choose Save image from the list.\n\n\n\n13) Quickly move slides around\n\nIn Google Slides, as with Docs and Sheets, there are a ton of handy keyboard shortcuts that can save you some time. We won’t list them all but Ctrl+Up and Ctrl+Down (using the cursor keys) let you quickly reposition the current slide (replace Ctrl with Cmd on a Mac).\n\n\n\n14) Edit images inside slides\n\nYou can easily edit images right inside slides: right-click and choose Image options to see what’s available inside the app. If you want to change the shape of one of your imported pictures, use the drop-down menu next to the crop button on the toolbar at the top.\n\n\n\n15) Match images to your presentation\n\nThe image import feature in Slides (and Docs and Sheets) is more advanced than you might realize: head over to the Search tab inside the image import box and you can look for pictures with a particular dominant color, to fit in with the theme of your presentation.\n\n\n\n16) Find the right fonts\n\nIf you’re looking for the perfect font for a presentation (or indeed a document or spreadsheet) you don’t have to settle for the default set. If you click the font drop-down menu on the toolbar then you’ll notice a More fonts link you can take advantage of.\n\n\n\n17) Present on a Chromecast\n\nOne of the easiest ways of getting your carefully crafted presentation up on the big screen is via a Chromecast dongle on your network. Click the drop-down menu next to Present, then choose the Present on another screen option, then pick your device from the list.\n\n\n\n18) Duplicate objects quickly\n\nIf one of your Slides calls for more than one of a particular object then there’s a quick way to duplicate something that’s already on screen. Hold down Ctrl (or Cmd on a Mac) then click and drag it with the mouse. It works on text boxes as well as images and shapes.\n\n", "Verizon has topped itself by playing Russian roulette with consumer trust in an attempt to compete with the advertising businesses of Google and Facebook. In an email announcement last Sunday night to select subscribers, Verizon signaled how it intends to compete with those two powerhouses, outlining its plan to combine offline information, such as postal address, email address and device type, with AOL browser cookies, Apple and Google advertising IDs, and their own unique identifier header. Coupled with all of their customers’ browsing history and app usage, this mass of customer data will make for a rich competitive product to Facebook and Google.\n\nFacebook, Google and now Verizon are in fast pursuit of the holy grail for digital advertising — syncing up a consumers’ personally identifiable information with all browsing history and app usage.\n\nThere’s just one problem: This practice requires explicit opt-in consent from consumers under the new FCC privacy rules. Although the rules are not yet required to be adopted (and notably on the chopping block in a Trump presidency), it's hard to argue that Verizon’s plan doesn't violate the spirit of the rulemaking.\n\nVerizon’s unilateral move to compete with Google and Facebook is likely due to the fact that the well-documented “duopoly” collectively takes more than 100 percent of the incremental growth in digital advertising — their gravy train is tied to the data which fuels their direct-marketing businesses. Why? Because Google and Facebook have a unique ability to link up personally identified users with browsing history, app usage and location across the device graph.\n\nIt’s been nearly two years since I wrote for Recode about Verizon and Turn’s massive zombie cookie stumble which ultimately led to an FCC investigation and settlement. It was a prime example of the breakdown in consumer trust, which we had been highlighting for years, and presciently previewed the ad blocking crisis to come. It also inspired DCN to express its concern to the FCC when the agency deliberated how to enforce privacy rules for broadband. After all, ISPs have a unique ability to see nearly all of your internet traffic, not unlike Google and Facebook.\n\nWhether it’s a third party like Facebook or Google tracking across the web, or an ISP leveraging its distribution arm, this is outside of consumer expectations.\n\nEnter ad blocking. The primary consumer grievances inspiring installation of ad blockers are now widely understood: Ads infringe on user privacy, obscure content, expose users’ devices to security hazards, and hoover up bandwidth and slow page loads. As the IAB’s LEAN standards bear fruit, we expect several of these concerns to be pacified. However, the industry is willfully ignoring the canary in the coal mine — consumer privacy. While the “A” in LEAN refers to the industry’s self-regulatory AdChoices program, consumers need even more protection and better privacy tools.\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook, Google and now Verizon are instead accelerating their tracking efforts, despite privacy concerns appearing consistently in the top reasons for using an ad blocker. They are in fast pursuit of the holy grail for digital advertising — syncing up a consumers’ personally-identifiable information with all browsing history and app usage:\n\nFacebook was the first company to do this at scale across devices, due to its persistent login for the service. The social network was only missing an ability to track browsing history and app usage across the web, which it solved in 2014 by proliferating the web with “Like” buttons to passively track consumer web usage under the disguise of being a consumer feature. Google held fast on its privacy promise for nearly a decade until the pressures to compete with Facebook and link up personal info across devices became too significant. In October, investigative reporter Julia Angwin uncovered that Google had quietly erased its ban on personally identifiable web tracking by linking up its massive DoubleClick tracking arm with its personal info from Gmail. The most extensive data brokers can collect thousands of points of data on consumers, but their accuracy and capabilities are limited by not being able to link up to personal information. My most recent review of BlueKai’s detailed registry of what they think they know about me was littered with bad information.\n\nWhether it’s a third party like Facebook or Google tracking across the web or an ISP leveraging its distribution arm, this is outside of consumer expectations. Importantly to the digital media industry, it also devalues the context and relationship of consumer trust which drives the businesses of premium publishers. While we were hopeful that the new FCC privacy rules would shift value back to publishers, we now recognize that they’re in limbo without backing from the White House.

So many factors influenced the ultimate outcome, but one in particular — the way Google and Yahoo differed in their approach to core infrastructure — seems especially telling.\n\nPerhaps my perspective is affected by the fact that I worked closely on the underlying Google File System, but I still believe Google’s sharp contrast with Yahoo on infrastructure offers powerful lessons about building a sustainable business, especially in the rapidly transforming technology landscape.\n\nBuilding fast and building to last\n\nAt the beginning of the new millennium, Google and Yahoo started down very different paths to attain the enormous scale that the growing size and demands of the Internet economy (search, email, maps, etc.) required. For Yahoo, the solution came in the form of NetApp filers, which allowed the company to add server space at a dizzying rate. Almost every service that Yahoo offered ultimately ran on NetApp’s purpose-built storage appliances, which were quick to set up and easy to use, giving Yahoo a fast track to meet market demand (and soon made the company NetApp’s largest customer).\n\nBut in nearby Mountain View, Google began work on engineering its own software-defined infrastructure, ultimately known as the Google File System, which would function as a platform that could serve a diverse range of use cases for all the services Google would offer as part of its future ecosystem. Instead of using the latest storage appliances as a foundation, the Google File System used commodity servers to support a flexible and resilient architecture that could solve scalability and resiliency issues once and for all, simplifying and accelerating the future rollout of a wide range of web-scale applications, from maps to cloud storage.\n\nScaling complexity\n\nIt took four years of ongoing development, and enormous amounts of engineering resources, before the Google File System reached the point where the company used it for mission-critical operations. Meanwhile, Yahoo had been able to add NetApp filers almost immediately to keep up with growing demands for its services. In the race to dominate the Internet landscape, it appeared Yahoo had pulled far ahead.\n\nHowever, Yahoo’s rapid go-to-market approach also began to show some cracks. As demand continued to expand and diversify, downsides to the appliance-based infrastructure emerged in the form of redundant engineering work, increasingly complex and inefficient environments and finally, mounting vendor costs. When Yahoo added a new service, it needed to re-engineer the NetApp platform for that specific use case.\n\nAs a result, identical challenges for separate services, such as Yahoo Search and Yahoo Mail, had to be solved multiple times on different infrastructures. The fragmented infrastructure also exposed greater resource inefficiencies, as each use case required separate server space and compute power that couldn’t be shared across the platform. On top of that, the cost to run NetApp appliances grew as fast as Yahoo did, taking a significant bite out of the company’s revenue.\n\nCompletely understand the problem before even considering the solution.\n\nOn the other hand, Google built its file system in anticipation of these challenges, so that adding new use cases or fixing underlying architecture challenges could be done efficiently. After the purchase of YouTube, for example, Google could simply say, “throw away your back-end and we’ll put you on our platform.” Engineers could make upgrades to the underlying architecture once, and the solution would apply across all of Google’s services.\n\nFinally, the flexible platform allowed resources and compute power to be shared across different use cases, so that when servers weren’t busy on search they could be used to process email. It didn’t hurt that all this was built on commodity hardware, which offered costs that decreased in line with Moore’s Law.\n\nAs the cost and complexity of Yahoo’s underlying infrastructure mounted, the company simply could not afford to match Google’s pace in developing and deploying major new applications.\n\nThe importance of a fresh start\n\nThis could be a simple story about the importance of flexible architecture, but I believe the lessons here extend beyond infrastructure or application engineering, and offer insight into what it takes to build a sustainable business. It speaks directly to one of the most important things I’ve learned from my time at Google: the need to completely understand the problem before even considering the solution.\n\nWhen you visualize a problem, start from scratch. Whether you’re an engineer or an entrepreneur (or both), close your eyes to existing solutions and ways of doing things, ignore what has been done before and build your ideal solution. Once you have that, you can determine which existing solutions should be used and what needs to be rebuilt.\n\nThis has been a key aspect of the success of many startups that have displaced legacy enterprises (consider Amazon’s decision to sell infrastructure-as-a-service, which disrupted Comdisco’s previous success outsourcing IT infrastructure on behalf of enterprise clients). It’s also increasingly common at larger companies that don’t want to lose their place to the next young upstart (similar to how Facebook is increasingly building its own infrastructure, from server racks to cameras).\n\nOf course, there are times when the “start from scratch” approach means sacrificing immediate growth for long-term sustainability, which can be a hard pill to swallow, especially in the fast-moving world of Silicon Valley. But quick fixes bring greater risk in the form of growing complexity and inefficiency. Google built a broad platform that extends across the entire web by focusing on simplicity and flexibility, while the complexity of Yahoo’s infrastructure may be the reason it ends up as a small part of another business.", "Enlarge Image Jason Cipriani/CNET\n\nEditor's note at 6:11 p.m. PT: Niantic has acknowledged Pokemon Go gains unnecessary \"full access\" to users' Google accounts on iOS and is actively issuing a fix.

VPC\n\nA screenshot of Google image search results for 'three black teenagers.' (Photo: Google)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — Google image searches for \"three black teenagers\" and \"three white teenagers\" get very different results, raising troubling questions about how racial bias in society and the media is reflected online.\n\nKabir Alli, an 18-year-old graduating senior from Clover Hill High School in Midlothian, Va., posted a video clip on Twitter this week of a Google image search for \"three black teenagers\" which turned up an array of police mugshots. He and friends then searched for \"three white teenagers,\" and found groups of smiling young people.\n\n\"I had actually heard about this search from one of my friends and just wanted to see everything for myself. I didn't think it would actually be true,\" Alli told USA TODAY. \"When I saw the results I was nothing short of shocked.\"\n\nThe Twitter post has been retweeted nearly 65,000 times since Tuesday, and Twitter users are using the hashtag #threeblackteenagers to discuss the implications of the video. The conversation about online racism comes as people express anger that the photo of Brock Turner, a white former Stanford University student convicted in a high-profile sexual assault case, was from high school yearbook, not his police mugshot.\n\n\"I understand it's all just an algorithm based on most visited pages but Google should be able to have more control over something like that,\" Alli said.\n\nYOOOOOO LOOK AT THIS pic.twitter.com/uY1JysFm8w — July 3rd. (@iBeKabir) June 7, 2016\n\nPeople have been flagging racial bias in the results of search engines for years. Google says it's merely reflecting back the biases that exist in society and that show up in what and how people search online.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Google said its image search results are a reflection of what's on the Web, including the frequency with which certain types of images appear and how they are described.\n\n\"This means that sometimes unpleasant portrayals of sensitive subject matter online can affect what image search results appear for a given query,\" the statement read. \"These results don’t reflect Google’s own opinions or beliefs — as a company, we strongly value a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures.\"\n\nSome people agreed. \"Loooool. Not Google's fault, though. Just means black people need to work on stock online presentation and presence,\" one person tweeted.\n\nAlli says he, too, does not believe Google is racist. Since tweeting about the results, they have changed somewhat, largely as a result of his online experiment.\n\nI'm weak at y'all saying Google is racist 😂😂😂 — July 3rd. (@iBeKabir) June 8, 2016\n\n\"The fact all these mugshots came up is wrong, but black males making poor choices also plays a major role. If we don't want that image we need to work to change it,\" he said. \"It shouldn't be so difficult to find normal non-offensive pictures of three black teenagers. That search sort of portrays us as a whole and those pictures are not us. We have a lot to offer and that search does not do us any kind of justice.\"\n\nUCLA information studies and African American studies professor Safiya Umoja Noble says society should not let Google off the hook so easily.\n\n\"Google has had many, many incidents of racial bias appearing in its algorithm. It consistently issues a statement that it's not responsible for the output of its algorithm. And yet we have to ask ourselves: If Google is not responsible for its algorithm, who is?\" said Noble, who is writing a book that compiles and analyzes the social consequences of racially-biased online searches.\n\nBasically, the algorithm Google employs to show search results learns the biases of searchers and then reinforces it by showing those results more often. That is evident in top search results for white grandma (Grandma VanDoren's White Bread Recipe and Grandma's Bakery in White Bear Lake, MN) and black grandma (porn videos). Not all algorithms work the same. Search results on Bing.com and Yahoo search are different, surfacing a public television documentary Mexico & Peru: The Black Grandma in the Closet and black granny boots. Google is far more influential, handling at least two trillion searches a year.\n\nBest way for Google to reflect positive images of Black youth is for folks to share/post great pics https://t.co/YOgEiFDSp2#3blackteenagers — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) June 9, 2016\n\nSome say search engines should do more, not just to address the bias surfaced by algorithms, but to use algorithms to combat it.\n\nWith cuts to public education and increased reliance on technology to deliver answers, search engines wield more power than ever before in deciding what information is seen and what information is important. People view Google as an unassailable source of credible and reliable information. Yet, what's often missing in search results that are not curated by a thoughtful hand, say a librarian or teacher: awareness of gender stereotypes and racial biases.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, 91% of search engine users say they always or nearly always find the information they are seeking when using a search engine and 73% of them say that most or all of the information they find is accurate and trustworthy.\n\n\"And they are when you are looking for the hours for the local Starbucks,\" said Noble. \"But when you are looking for information, ideas or concepts, the algorithm often fails us deeply and yet society does not really see that the algorithm as a failure except when these kinds of egregious moments happen.\"\n\nLongtime Google observer Danny Sullivan says Google is reflecting what's happening on the Web and \"the problems of society as a whole.\" But, says the founding editor of Search Engine Land, \"Google could perhaps find appropriate ways to adjust.\"\n\nFor generic image searches for groups of people such as \"black teenagers,\" Google could, for example, return more positive images, Sullivan said.\n\n\"If someone is going to search for mugshots, we are not looking for Google to give back positive-looking mugshots. It does not mean you won't find negative content if you go looking for it,\" Sullivan said. \"I do think Google needs to spend more time looking at what they are doing and asking themselves how they balance being a reflection of what's across the Web with also making sure that they are not reinforcing things and that they are making sure people are fairly treated.\"\n\nChristian Sandvig, professor of information at the University of Michigan, proposes a \"Consumer Reports\" approach to algorithms.\n\n\"We need a systematic approach to this issue that independently monitors these systems from the outside,\" Sandvig said.\n\n\"These companies are happy to assume responsibility for blocking content that makes their sites unpleasant to use and might eat into advertising revenue,\" he said. \"But when they are asked about other kinds of content — content that represents a more subtle problem or doesn't threaten the user experience of their product — we get the argument that objective algorithms made these decisions based on our own behavior. This implies: 'Since these decisions were made by a computer program, they are inhuman, and therefore we aren't responsible for them.' This begs the question: Aren't programmers human? Don't humans work at Google?\"\n\nThis is not the first time that Google search results have been called out.\n\nLast year Google apologized — and suspended people's ability to submit edits to Google Maps — after searches using a racial epithet directed users to the White House.\n\nGraphic designer Johanna Burai set up World White Web after noticing Google searches for photos of hands returned photos of white hands. The site, WorldWhiteWeb.net, encourages people to link to images of hands that are not white.\n\nBurai toldBuzzFeed News in April that the project, which showed similar results for other body parts and search terms such as man, woman and child, illustrated societal biases.\n\nIn a similar query, student Bonnie Kamona searched \"unprofessional hairstyles for work\" and says the results featured African-American women. For \"professional hairstyles for work,\" the results featured blonde white women.\n\nThe search, as The Guardianpointed out, surfaced images of black women from blogs and articles that were \"explicitly discussing and protesting against racist attitudes to hair.\"\n\nI saw a tweet saying \"Google unprofessional hairstyles for work\".

It identified a black man and a white woman as apes on two occasions.\n\nA 2013 study by Latanya Sweeney, a professor at Harvard University, found \"statistically significant discrimination\" in online advertising results. Names associated with black people \"generated ads suggestive of an arrest in 81 to 86% of name searches on one web site and 92 to 95% on the other,\" the study found, while names associated with white people generated more neutral results.\n\n\"These companies are not doing the user test keyword searches that African Americans are doing.

Most employees are white (60%) and Asian (31%). Latinos made up just 3% of the work force and African Americans just 2% — a far cry from reflecting the racial and ethnic diversity of its users in the U.S. and around the world.\n\n\"We are talking about fixing the culture in companies and fixing the woefully under-educated work force in Silicon Valley where people are not trained in ethnic studies and they are not trained in women's studies,\" said Noble. \"They have no idea what the import of the work is having in the social dimension.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1tdHoPA", "A version of this essay was originally published at Tech.pinions, a website dedicated to informed opinions, insight and perspective on the tech industry.\n\nOne of the wonderful things about the rise of the web, twentysomething years ago, was the way in which it democratized publishing — suddenly, anyone with an idea could set up a website and make it available to anyone. Early on, publishing online required at least a rudimentary understanding of code. To be an online writer meant you also had to be a coder. But, services quickly emerged that created WYSIWYG editors for online publications, so literally anyone who had used a word processor could create online content.\n\nRecently, however, we’ve seen the rise of proprietary formats like Google’s AMP, Facebook’s Instant Articles and the Apple News Format, which threaten to de-democratize publishing on the web. To be clear, I’m not making a philosophical argument about the closed nature of these platforms but something much more practical: Creating content for these formats reintroduces a coding requirement, and online code is vastly more complicated today than it was in the mid-1990s.\n\nA personal history\n\nI first encountered the web when I entered university in 1994. It was a pretty primitive thing back then, with very limited ways to access it, and it was almost entirely text-based. But over the next four years, things moved forward rapidly, with additional web browsers improving the process of browsing the web, and hosting and other online services making it easier for ordinary people like me to set up an online presence. By the time I graduated in 1997, not only was browsing the web a big part of my life, I had a website of my own. In order to build that website, I had to learn HTML, which, at the time, was a very simple thing to grasp, at least at a basic level. But that coding requirement still prevented many people from creating an online presence.\n\nAs these platforms — especially AMP and Instant Articles — suck up an ever greater proportion of online content, that’s going to leave smaller publishers out in the cold.\n\nInterestingly, I basically took a two-year break from the web between early 1998 and early 2000 while I was serving as a missionary in Asia. When I returned, the web had again moved on significantly. Blogger had launched in 1999 and was one of the first sites that enabled people to create their own websites without knowing anything about coding, web hosting or any of the other more technical aspects that had previously characterized online publishing. Almost all of my online publishing since has been based on various blogging platforms and, for the last 10 years, almost exclusively on self-hosted WordPress sites.\n\nAlong the way, because I’ve always had something of an interest in coding, I’ve beefed up my understanding of HTML, grappled with CSS style sheets, and even done some messing around with PHP. But I’m always enormously grateful I don’t have to try to build sites that would perform well from the ground up — I’ve long since given up on that idea.\n\nEnter AMP, Instant Articles and Apple News\n\nSo much for my personal history. Since last summer, we’ve seen what I’d argue is the latest phase in this online publishing evolution. It involves the creation of a variety of proprietary formats for online publishing. Google has been spearheading the Accelerated Mobile Pages project (AMP), which launched officially almost a year ago. Facebook introduced its Instant Articles format last summer, with a similar objective of accelerating the delivery of articles on mobile devices. And Apple introduced News as part of iOS 9, opening it up to publishers over the summer and to most users in the Fall, albeit with different intentions.\n\nHere’s what these platforms have in common, however: Each uses proprietary formats to deliver articles to readers. Technically, these formats use standards-based elements — for example, AMP is a combination of custom HTML, custom JavaScript and caching. But the point here is the outputs from traditional online publishing platforms aren’t compatible with any of these three formats. And in order to publish to these formats directly, you need to know a lot more code than I ever did back in the mid-1990s before the first round of WYSIWYG tools for the web emerged.\n\nWe’re effectively turning back the clock to a pre-web world in which the only publishers that mattered were large publishers, and it was all but impossible to be read if you didn’t work for one of them.\n\nAs a solution, each of these platforms has provided tools intended to bridge the gap — all three, for example, have WordPress plugins to convert content to the appropriate formats. But a quick read of the reviews for the Facebook and AMP plugins tells you they don’t seem to be doing the job for many users. The Apple News plugin has a higher rating, but I know from my own experience that it’s problematic. Both Facebook and Apple also offer RSS tools to import existing content, but there are limitations around both (Apple News doesn’t allow advertising in RSS-driven publications, while Facebook IA requires a custom RSS feed with IA-specific markup, which is again going to be beyond the ken of most non-coding publishers). Apple news offers a WYSIWYG tool, but it’s extremely basic (it doesn’t support embeds, block quotes, or even bullet points).\n\nWhy does all this matter? After all, no one is forcing anyone to use any of these formats — publishing to the open web is still possible. While that’s technically true, at least two of these formats — AMP and Instant Articles — are being favored by the two largest gatekeepers to online content: Google and Facebook. Google now favors AMP results in search, while Facebook does the same within its News Feed, though less explicitly (by favoring faster-loading pages, it gives IA content a leg up). Apple News is different — it’s a self-contained app, and it’s basically irrelevant to you as a publisher unless your readers are using it. But if you do decide to use it, unless you publish in Apple News Format, you can’t monetize your content there, and Apple is pushing the News app heavily to its users.\n\nTurning back the clock\n\nThe upshot of all of this is, unless you’re comfortable with fairly advanced web coding, or can pay someone who is, your online publication is likely to become a second-class citizen on each of these new platforms, if it has a presence there at all. And, as these platforms — especially AMP and Instant Articles — suck up an ever greater proportion of online content, that’s going to leave smaller publishers out in the cold.\n\nThat in turn means we’re effectively turning back the clock to a pre-web world in which the only publishers that mattered were large publishers, and it was all but impossible to be read if you didn’t work for one of them. That seems like an enormous shame, and from a practical standpoint, matters a lot more to me as an online writer than more philosophical debates about open versus closed platforms.\n\nJan Dawson is founder and chief analyst at Jackdaw, a technology research and consulting firm focused on the confluence of consumer devices, software, services and connectivity.

And Google Analytics is to blame.\n\nIn the just over 10 years since the release of the platform in November 2005, too many tech marketers now ignore the difference between strategies and channels, favor digital channels that often deliver lower returns than traditional channels and think that direct responses are the only useful ROI metric.\n\nAnd all of that is wrong.\n\nNo one ever said “television marketing”\n\nImagine that it is the 1990s and I want to reach the people who watch “Friends” on television. I would have these three available strategies out of the five that comprise the traditional Promotion Mix:\n\nAdvertising\n\nPublicity (in the form of a product placement)\n\nDirect marketing (in the form of a direct-response infomercial)\n\nI could run an advertisement during an episode of “Friends.” I could pay NBC to have the coffee house hold an event that would feature my product in an episode. I could hire a “Friends” actor to appear in an infomercial that would air directly after an episode. And so on.\n\nNow, none of this would be “television marketing” because “television marketing” is not a “thing.” “Television” is a marketing channel, not a marketing strategy. If I choose to advertise on television, “advertising” is the strategy, the advertisement itself is the content and “television” is the channel over which I transmit the advertisement.\n\nThe strategy, message and marketing collateral matter more than the channel.\n\nIn the same way, “Facebook marketing,” “social media marketing” and “content marketing” are not “things.” “Facebook” is a marketing channel. “Social media” is a collection of marketing channels. “Content” is a tactic, not a strategy. “Content” is produced in the execution of strategies such as advertising, SEO and publicity. Here are two examples.\n\nIf a tech marketer creates a video and spreads it on Facebook, here is what he is doing:\n\nStrategy = Advertising (one of the parts of the traditional Promotion Mix)\n\nContent = The video itself\n\nChannel = Facebook\n\nIf someone creates informational material that aims to rank highly in Google search results, here is what he is doing:\n\nStrategy = SEO (which may need to be added to a new, modern Promotion Mix)\n\nContent = The blog post\n\nChannel = The company’s blog/Google search results\n\nWhy is this important?

And it was the introduction of Google Analytics that led to these poor assumptions and this bad terminology today.\n\nThe traditional marketing analytics buckets\n\nMarketing campaigns have always involved the creation of a message, the insertion of that message into a piece of content and the transmission of that content over a channel to an audience.\n\nAnd as I wrote in my prior, much-discussed TechCrunch column that discussed how too many marketers in the tech world do not understand basic marketing terminology and practices, that overall process occurs within the strategic frameworks of the five “buckets” within the Promotion Mix (“promotion” is one of the four Ps in product marketing): direct marketing, advertising, sales promotion, personal selling and publicity.\n\nIn this lengthy tutorial on integrating traditional and online marketing on Moz, I described how each of these “buckets” has pros and cons, as well as best practices:\n\nWhen marketers brainstorm campaigns, they typically ask these questions, in this order:\n\nWho is our target audience and what are our goals? What is the best message for that audience? In light of our goals, which strategies within the Promotion Mix — advertising, direct marketing, sales promotion, direct selling and publicity — should we use to communicate that message? What are the best online and/or offline channels for that strategy to reach that audience? What marketing collateral and creatives should we create and transmit based on the answers to the prior four questions? How can we measure the results based on which metrics are relevant to each strategy within the Promotion Mix that we will use?\n\nThe strategy, message and marketing collateral matter more than the channel.\n\nHere’s a publicity example. Say that someone uses the various tactics that I describe in my publicity tutorial on Moz to get a New York Times reporter to write about his company. The resulting article will appear in print, on the website and on the Amazon Kindle. The article will be spread on social media and shared in online forums and news aggregators. And so on. This is why there is actually no such thing as “digital PR.” It’s just “PR.” The best publicity practices to get coverage never change, regardless of the channels over which the coverage will appear.\n\nIt is strategies, not channels, that have associated best practices and deliver results.\n\nHere’s a direct marketing example. Say that one writes advertising copy to generate direct-response leads. That same copy will often deliver similar results — subject to specific, individual format restrictions of each channel — across platforms, including direct mail, email, Facebook ads and Google AdWords, because human nature does not change.\n\nThere is no “digital marketing” and “traditional marketing.” There is only marketing — just ask Campbell’s, which has now consolidated all offline and online work under the CMO.\n\nGoogle Analytics changed the buckets\n\nAccording to W3TECHS, Google Analytics is used by 55 percent of all websites and has a traffic analysis tool market share of 83 percent. More than half of those websites use GA as their only source of marketing data.\n\nGoogle transformed the marketing industry. However, the introduction and widespread adoption of GA pushed marketers to change their focus from the strategy to the channel (this is a screenshot from an old client of mine back when I was a consultant):\n\nTraditional marketing allocates activities based on the strategies that comprise the traditional Promotion Mix: direct marketing, advertising, personal selling, sales promotion and publicity. Google Analytics replaced those “buckets” with these entirely new ones: direct, organic search, social, referral, paid search, email and display.\n\nHowever, that shift in assumption has led to poor marketing because almost any strategy can be executed over any channel — and it is strategies, not channels, that have associated best practices and deliver results.\n\nTake “social media marketing,” a vague, useless phrase that refers to channels but not to any specific strategy:\n\nDirect marketing campaigns (that are inaccurately called “advertising campaigns”) get direct responses from a specific set of people on social media based on their demographics and what they “like”\n\nAdvertising campaigns put paid media published by an identified sponsor in front of a mass audience on social media\n\nPublicity campaigns gain mass exposure through earned or owned media that is spread on social media\n\nPersonal selling campaigns have salespeople contact prospects and leads over social media\n\nSales promotion campaigns circulate coupons, discounts and codes on social media to generate immediate sales\n\nEach of these five things can be deemed “social media marketing” — but when a term means everything, it means nothing. The five traditional strategies have best practices, as well as times and places to use — and NOT to use — them within an overall marketing plan.\n\nTo ask “What is the ROI of social media?” makes as much sense as asking “What’s the ROI of the telephone?”\n\nBy not using and knowing the traditional terminology that the marketing industry uses for precise reasons, marketers are only hurting themselves and their own campaigns.\n\nWhen one now looks at Google Analytics and sees the results, for example, in the “Social” bucket, it’s rarely clear which of these strategies and activities delivered which results. The same is true for almost all of the “buckets” that appear in online marketing analytics. The strategic activity matters more than the communications channel. The channel merely dictates the format of the marketing collateral and content that one creates within an overall strategy.\n\nTo ask “What is the ROI of social media?” makes as much sense as asking “What’s the ROI of the telephone?” Activities, not channels, generate ROI. But after Google Analytics and every other marketing platform defined “social media” and other channels as buckets, and therefore as marketing strategies, people have confused strategies and channels ever since.\n\nThe positive thing about GA is that we can know which channels tend to perform the best. The negative thing about GA is that we know less about which specific, overall strategies and activities over those channels lead the best results.\n\nGoogle Analytics pushed everyone online\n\nGoogle Analytics did not only confuse marketers in terms of the difference between strategies and channels — the platform also trapped our industry into focusing more and more on digital channels at the expense of offline ones.\n\nOf course, GA can be a very useful tool. The basic version is free, so it is no wonder that countless tech startups use the platform. But it comes with a limitation: It can only track online channels. If someone, for example, runs a television advertisement, he will see zero information in Google Analytics on the results that he can attribute directly to the advertisement.\n\nSo, people now have a subconscious bias toward using online channels — just like everyone else in the tech world. In just one example from the Internet Advertising Bureau in the United Kingdom, spending on digital advertising there increased from roughly £500 million in 2003 to £7.2 billion in 2014. The more we rely on Google Analytics, the more we will use strategies such as direct marketing over AdWords that are easily trackable in GA rather than strategies that are less trackable — as I will explain below.\n\nA more cynical person might think that this has been Google’s intention all along. After all, the more time we spend online — especially over our commutes once our cars will drive themselves — the more money that the search engine makes.\n\nBut as Mitch Joel tweeted, prioritizing online channels often comes at a cost in terms of negative branding and marketing quality:\n\nBooked a rental car. Now, all I see are ads for that company. Everywhere. Ugh. This is what will drive the use of ad blockers. — Mitch Joel (@mitchjoel) April 14, 2016\n\nAs Ad Contrarian Bob Hoffman once described the industry: “The aesthetic lineage of online advertising is not “Madison Avenue,” it is the maddening tackiness of junk mail direct response.”\n\nDirect marketing is the most annoying form of marketing over any channel. It’s the junk mail that people throw away. It’s the automated email spam that is now called “lead nurturing.” It’s the ads that interrupt you on social networks when you’re trying to connect with friends and family. It’s having the same advertisement follow you around the internet.\n\nCreativity is what builds brands and sells products.\n\nFor all of the excitement over the rise of so-called marketing automation platforms, people should realize that all these platforms do is send and resend all of this direct-response material based on a predefined timetable and workflow. There is absolutely no creativity — and creativity is what builds brands and sells products.\n\nPeople tolerate offline advertising and publicity campaigns — and they even fondly remember the few that are the most creative. But people hate online advertising — which is actually almost always direct marketing by another name — and increasingly rush to block it however possible.\n\nThe online advertising industry is committing slow suicide through the use of intrusive platforms that are so invasive that people are choosing to block ads altogether.\n\nGoogle Analytics gives only direct ROI\n\nDirect marketing may be the most annoying form of marketing, but it is the strategy whose direct ROI is the easiest to track. Here’s a basic and hypothetical example:\n\nI sent catalogues/emails/Facebook ads to 10,000 people for $5,000 and that directly resulted in 100 new customers (who are projected to generate a total of $12,000 in lifetime revenue).\n\nSuch direct-response results online are easy to set up and see in Google Analytics. But the picture is more muddled when one uses other marketing strategies.\n\nTo illustrate the point, here’s an example that I have seen in my company’s high-tech marketing work. I’m a marketing speaker who presents at marketing conferences such as Content Marketing Masters and MozCon. My company’s executives frequently discuss the open source ELK Stack at tech conferences.\n\nIt is very difficult to attribute the precise results of all of this specific marketing activity in Google Analytics:\n\nIf someone sees us and types our brand into a search engine, the visit will be included under “Organic Search” in Google Analytics\n\nIf someone sees us and types our brand into a web browser or takes a brochure and visits our site directly a week later in a city 5,000 miles away, the visit will be shown as “Direct”\n\nIf someone sees us, searches for and visits our Facebook page, then comes to our website, the visit will fall under “Social Media”\n\nIf a reporter at a conference meets with us and then writes an article about us, the traffic will be seen as coming from “Referral”\n\nWhat does this mean? In many circumstances, it is impossible to determine in Google Analytics what exactly and precisely happens as a result of a given marketing activity.\n\nThe fault of marketing analytics platforms such as Google Analytics is that they track the source of traffic but not the cause of that traffic. In my conference example, we have four different sources of traffic that come from a single marketing activity. How does one quantify these results of that strategy?\n\nIf there were software that could isolate the direct, organic, social and referral traffic that comes to our website specifically as a result of such conference activity (or as a result of any other marketing strategy), I would purchase that platform in a digital heartbeat.\n\nThere are many other problems with typical Google Analytics data. In the interest of space, I will link to further information about them:\n\nStill, too many marketers view GA data as the digital Holy Grail because the Google Analytics API is used in countless other marketing platforms, and the same set of misleading “buckets” is used in other web analytics software, as well.\n\nGoogle Analytics hooked us on direct metrics\n\nRightly or wrongly, the startup world cares mainly about direct-response metrics — and that is reflected in the “Goals” and “Events” triggers in Google Analytics.\n\nIn “Disrupted,” the memoir by former tech journalist and “Silicon Valley” TV show writer Dan Lyons that describes his ill-fated time at the marketing software company HubSpot, he describes their blogging strategy in this way (pg. 74-75):\n\n[HubSpot’s former CMO] has one goal: to get leads. If our software analytics were to indicate that our best conversion rate comes from publishing a blog post that just says the word dogshit over and over again… then [the former CMO] would publish that post…\n\nI realize there probably is a legitimate business model to be made from churning out crappy content. But that is not something you hire the former technology editor of Newsweek to write for you.\n\nThis is the problem that arises when startups and other companies use direct-response metrics such as the direct sales, leads or downloads that are shown in Google Analytics as the primary or only success metric.\n\nClickbait might get more traffic, but will only reflect poorly on the brand.\n\nBlogs, for example, have become one of the primary communications channels for many companies, so integrated marketing and communications strategies need to incorporate branding and PR into those outlets, as well. To use Lyons’ example, a blog post that just repeats “dogshit” over and over might actually generate the greatest number of marketing leads — but it would be terrible for PR and branding, and those metrics are not shown in Google Analytics.\n\nA focus only on GA metrics often leads startups to move toward publishing not informational material but rather more and more “clickbait.” And clickbait might get more traffic, but will only reflect poorly on the brand and cause other damage, as well.\n\nBesides, the number of pageviews is a useful metric only for websites whose main business model is online advertising (such as news websites), because each page view sends a server request for ad impressions. Companies, on the other hand, whose goal is to obtain more customers, often see that clickbait delivers a lot of traffic but fewer conversions in the end.\n\nIntegrating online and offline channels\n\nElsewhere, I have written on how marketers and communicators should operate in a world with numerous available traditional and digital channels. Here is a flowchart that summarizes my process:\n\nThe overall theory: Segment the target demographic and create a persona. Decide the 4 Ps. Create an overall strategy that assigns weights to each part of the Promotion Mix. Choose the messaging. Select the best online and offline channels. Produce the marketing collateral. Transmit to the audience. Measure the results.\n\nBut the problem is when online marketers often drink their own digital Kool-Aid, ignore traditional channels and exaggerate the effectiveness of modern channels. (And I’m not even taking all of the online advertising fraud in the industry into account.)\n\nRemember Oreo’s famous Super Bowl tweet? Ritson ran all of the numbers and calculated that it was seen by less than 1 percent of Oreo’s target market. And that example is held up as “social media marketing” at its very best. In another example from Hoffman, Pepsi lost enough market share to drop to third when it moved its budget from TV to social media.\n\nBut social media consultants and agencies are always going to say that “social media is the answer,” because their livelihoods depend on it — even though Ritson notes that it is often not the answer and Hoffman says, perhaps too bluntly, that it’s part of modern marketing’s bull—-. Digital video platforms are always going to claim that “TV is dying” because their success depends on it — even though TV has never been more popular than it is today.\n\nFew take the time to research the facts, and instead just regurgitate whatever spews forth from the digital marketing echo chamber. And most people are selling something. An advertising consultant or SEO agency is always going to say, respectively, that advertising or SEO is the solution to everything.\n\nTying it all together\n\nAs an in-house marketer, I have the luxury of not being forced to favor a given marketing strategy or channel. In my work life, I have no bias and will do whatever builds our brand and gains more users. Most consultants and agencies are tied to specific strategies, tactics and channels because of their singular expertise.\n\nAs a former journalist in my first career, I also have the luxury of being able to use those past skills, turn a critical and neutral eye toward the high-tech and marketing industries and then write my thoughts in contributed columns here on TechCrunch and elsewhere on Moz.\n\nThe more than half of all commercial websites that use Google Analytics as their only source of marketing analytics will find that their options are limited and that they are applying faulty metrics to the wrong marketing strategies.\n\nThat is what happens when people get locked into a single software platform — be it Google Analytics or anything else. Their entire worldview and business processes wrap themselves around that platform despite any limitations, flaws and mistaken assumptions.\n\nThere is a whole world of marketing out there beyond attempts to answer the flawed question: “What content should I publish on my website to get the most traffic and customers?” Here is the real question to ask:\n\nHow would you market yourself if the Internet didn't exist? Answer that, and it'll help your online marketing too. — Samuel Scott (@samueljscott) August 25, 2015\n\nFeatured Image: Francis Miller/Getty Images", "This article first appeared in Term Sheet, Fortune's newsletter about deals and dealmakers.

To do so, it’s gathered up a giant pile of venture capital from a group of noteworthy strategic investors.\n\nThe company has raised $45 million in new venture funding from the venture capital arms of Alphabet , BMW, and Lowe’s. The round values Desktop Metal at $305 million pre-money, up from its valuation of $100 million in April 2016. The company has now raised a total of $97 million. Other investors include NEA, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Lux Capital, GE Ventures, Saudi Aramco, and Stratasys, a 3D printing company.\n\nRic Fulop, founder of A123 Systems and former general partner at North Bridge Venture Partners, created the company alongside four MIT professors: Ely Sachs, Chris Schuh, Yet Ming Chiang, and John Hart.\n\nFulop says this round of funding will allow the company to enter mass production. “Our vision is to change the way people make stuff,” he says. “It’s a big vision and it requires resources to scale it up.”\n\nThe 3D printing industry is frequently knocked for not living up to its early hype. Fulop concedes that is true in when it comes to plastic 3D printing and consumer-facing printers, but notes that industrial 3D printing has thrived and metal 3D printing is especially ripe for disruption. Fulop, who has backed SolidWorks and Dyn and OnShape, sees an opportunity to modernize and lower the cost of 3D metal printers, which can cost as much as $800,000 a pop. The market for these printers is growing 50% to 60% per year, he says. General Electric has a goal of building a $1 billion 3D printing business by 2020; last year it acquired Arcam, and it paid $599 million for Concept Laser.\n\nDesktop Metal’s new investors are potential customers. BMW could use Desktop Metal’s printers for car parts, likewise Lowe’s for in-house products. Uwe Higgen, Managing Partner of BMW i Ventures, notes that working with Desktop Metal is part of the company’s plan to adopt additive manufacturing at BMW. “Desktop Metal is shaping the way cars will be imagined, designed and manufactured,” he says,\n\nFulop said he was not at liberty to share the reason for Alphabet’s interest (via GV, its venture capital arm), except that it was “crazy stuff.” Andy Wheeler, General Partner at GV, noted that Desktop Metal is shaping the “dynamic evolution” that shaping the additive manufacturing industry.\n\n“The promise of 3d printing … is making things you couldn’t make any other way,” Fulop says. “Once you are able to reduce the cost and make it more accessible, it enables you to … speed up the product cycle.”", "Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. (Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images)\n\nQ. Now that Google has finally updated the Google Voice app, should I use that instead of Hangouts? Or is there another messaging app I should consider?\n\nA. Google’s announcement that it was readying the first major update to its Google Voice apps in “several years” confused many people who had long since switched to Google’s Hangouts apps for calls and texts with a Google Voice number as well as voicemail with their regular cell number.\n\nGoogle’s post offered only vague guidance about whether a Hangouts user should switch: “There’s no need to change to the new apps, but you might want to try them out as we continue to bring new improvements.”\n\nGoogle PR, however noted some basic differences between these two ways to use Google Voice — the calling service it launched in 2009 that lets users get an additional phone number in the area code of their choice and use that for free domestic and cheap international calls.\n\nThe new Google Voice apps — available now for iOS, still rolling out on Android — let you search your messages and voicemail transcripts and provides more customization, including an option to forward your Google Voice text messages to another number. The Android app will also let you call from your Google Voice number using the regular Android dialer.\n\nHangouts, however, also does video calling, both one-to-one and group calling. Google says it will focus this app for business use and suggests home users looking for video calls switch to yet another app, Duo. That iOS and Android program, however, doesn’t allow group video chats.\n\nIf you don’t need the voicemail features of the Google Voice and Hangouts apps — both let you play back messages in any order and provide automated, sometimes unintentionally hilarious transcriptions of them — you can use yet another Google messaging app.\n\nAllo, a free download for iOS and Android, can exchange text messages with regular phones but also supports such formatting extras as stickers and varying text sizes in Allo-to-Allo chats. It connects you to Google Assistant, the automated helper that runs inside Google’s Home smart-home hub and its Pixel phones.\n\nIn addition, Allo lets you protect a conversation with end-to-end encryption that scrambles your messages against eavesdropping. It doesn’t officially support use with a Google Voice number, but Allo users have said that works too.\n\nTwo other messaging apps use your mobile number as your username but provide much more security. WhatsApp, the app Facebook bought for $16 billion in 2014, does text messaging and voice calls over your Internet connection, all encrypted end-to-end by default. This free app sees wide use outside the U.S., where many phone plans don’t include unlimited text messaging. But you can’t use it to chat with people who aren’t on WhatsApp.\n\nOpen Whisper Systems’ free Signal also provides end-to-end encryption for messages and calls and allows you to send self-destructing messages that will erase themselves in as little as five seconds or as long as one week after being read. In addition, this app can replace your regular text-messaging app.\n\nAlthough neither WhatsApp nor Signal support Google Voice directly, a quick workaround can set up both with a Google number. Instead of having each confirm your ownership of those digits by sending a text message, use the backup option of an automated call. You’ll hear a custom code read out, which you then plug into the app.\n\nRob Pegoraro is a tech writer based out of Washington, D.C. To submit a tech question, e-mail Rob at rob@robpegoraro.com.

Alphabet is sending hundreds of employees at Access—the division that runs the high-speed internet service—to work at other parts of the company, an Access spokeswoman says. It’s not the end of Fiber, not exactly. But the slimming-down likely signals a future for Alphabet’s broadband ambitions that involves less fiber.\n\nGoogle first announced Fiber in 2010 with a widely publicized contest to see which city the company would first grace with its ultra-fast service. Since then, Fiber has spread to several US cities and metropolitan areas. But Access said in October that it was curtailing plans to expand to new locations, and Alphabet has clearly lost faith in the idea of running fiber optic cables right into people’s homes, at least in the traditional way. Instead, Access has hired a new CEO, tech and broadband veteran Greg McCray, to figure out new ways to bring faster—and presumably cheaper—high-speed internet access to the rest of the country. Those plans may not include much fiber from Google at all.\n\nAccess’ restructuring won’t affect the places where Google Fiber is already available—new customers can still sign up, and the company is still pushing forward with plans to offer Fiber in Nashville, Louisville, and San Antonio. And it’s possible the company could one day resume efforts to bring actual fiber into homes if it can figure out a way that costs a lot less money. (The company has been experimenting with a process called microtrenching.) But for now, the future of high-speed internet from Google looks decidedly wireless.\n\nThe problem with rolling out a new, high-speed internet service the traditional cables-in-the-ground way is that even though many cities already have plenty of fiber optic pipe buried beneath their streets, it’s still hellishly expensive to connect those pipes to customers’ homes. Last year, however, Access bought Webpass, a company that beams high-speed broadband via networks of small antennas. That approach might enable Google Fiber to deliver service to individual customers by tapping into existing fiber optic infrastructure without having to string new cables along utility poles or dig up people’s yards.\n\nLast October, just as the Webpass acquisition was closing, Access petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to open up more of the wireless spectrum that Webpass uses, which could enable Fiber to expand wirelessly much more quickly. Meanwhile, Fiber is already experimenting with new wireless technologies in Kansas City and looks set to expand those experiments to other cities as well.\n\nFor now, the future of high-speed internet from Google looks decidedly wireless.\n\nEventually Google Fiber could offer even more radical wireless technologies. For example, Webpass has tested technology from Artemis Networks, a startup building a new type of wireless service that can “follow” users from place to place and guarantee a certain amount of bandwidth. Developing those sorts of technologies is a radical departure from building a network that provides actual fiber to homes, and requires a different type of workforce. In a letter to employees about the transition, Alphabet CEO Larry Page said the leaner Access will largely work in the field, not from the company’s headquarters in Mountain View.\n\nA more wireless future for Fiber still comes with risks. More traditional telcos are also eyeing high-speed wireless internet as a way to bypass more expensive traditional broadband. In the meantime, Alphabet is still trying to figure out how to be a company that provides internet at all.", "Update: Interested in the new hotness in mobile VR? Google's Daydream View is now available, and it's picking up steam rather quickly.\n\nAfter just a few, short months of availability on store shelves and at the Google Store , the young platform has added a handful of new apps to keep you entertained, like Netflix VR and HBO Now VR.\n\nPreviously, you needed either the Pixel or Pixel XL smartphones to use Daydream View, but now the Moto Z and Moto Z Force support the VR platform. The list of compatible phones is still short, but 2017 has already seen a few models added to the list.\n\nOriginal article follows below.\n\nDaydream is Google's latest attempt at bringing VR to mobile devices, and it's quite different than Google Cardboard , to say the least.\n\nUnlike Google's somewhat-disposable VR headset, which aimed to get people in the VR door with a low cost and lenient power requirements, Daydream is a more robust vision that has its sight set on providing higher-quality experiences to Android Nougat users.\n\nDaydream will bring even more exciting and absorbing VR experiences to those who can't afford a HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. Here's everything you need to know about it.\n\nCut to the chase\n\nWhat is it? Google's next mobile VR platform\n\nGoogle's next mobile VR platform When is it out? Now\n\nNow What will it cost? $79 (£69, about AU$104)\n\nDaydream View headset\n\nWant to get started with Daydream? Google has its own headset that you'll be able to use with Daydream-ready phones. It's called Daydream View and unlike other VR headsets we've seen before it has a material design...just like its operating system. There's a latch on the front to slide your phone in and the controller for the headset is included.\n\nThankfully, Google hasn't locked down control of the Daydream formula, and is inviting other OEMs to create their own Daydream headsets. Huawei has stepped up first by announcing that its Huawei VR headset will support the Huawei Mate 9 Pro, which was added recently to the list of Daydream-ready phones.\n\nGoogle Daydream release date\n\nGoogle Daydream is baked into the OS on the Pixel, Pixel XL, as well as a few of the latest Moto Z devices.\n\nGoogle has also confirmed Samsung, Alcatel, Asus, HTC, LG, Xiaomi and ZTE will produce phones that are \"Daydream ready.\" Huawei also confirmed it would be making Daydream-ready phones, headsets and controllers.\n\nThe ZTE Axon 7 is the first smartphone announced to be Google Daydream-compatible along with its very-own VR headset, the ZTE VR. It just needs Android Nougat and Google's necessary VR maintenance software update to pull it off, which will come in the Android Nougat 7.1 update. Funny enough, we're still waiting on this update to land for ZTE's recent device.\n\nWhat can it do?\n\nGoogle Daydream will run apps and games downloaded from the Play Store making it easy to find experiences to use on your headset. According to Google, by the end of 2016 there will be over 50 apps and games available on the platform.\n\nThat includes a Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them tie-in experience as well as an app called Star Chart that allows you to explore the solar system as you look around. Google also showed off a shooter game from the makers of EVE called GunJack 2.\n\nNetflix, HBO and Hulu will all have Daydream ready apps in the coming months, plus The New York Times will launch an app too for its VR videos.\n\nPlus, Google will also make its own apps compatible with the Daydream platform. It's including Play Movies, Photos, Maps and YouTube when the platform launches.\n\nUnity and Epic also announced development support for Daydream on the gaming side of things. Here's some early footage of a Daydream prototype developed my Epic.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Daydream View headset shown off by Google is only one option for Daydream VR. It's also letting other companies take hold of the tech, which will likely result in a variety of different looking headsets.\n\nGoogle has divvied out a few details about its controller, which resembles a Wii remote, and shares some common physical traits from the latest Apple TV touch remote.\n\nOn its top, it will feature a clickable touch pad to bring native touchscreen-like gestures to the virtual world. Next down, there is an app button that will put your (you guessed it) apps within view. Lastly, the home button will return you to the home screen of Daydream.\n\nThere's also an entire user interface within Daydream that's ripe for discussion.\n\nThe Daydream hub looks refined and quite similar (OK, almost exactly the same) to the Oculus Home found within the Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR. You'll use the motion controller to navigate the menus and swap between apps, games and movies.\n\nAs Daydream will be deeply integrated into Android Nougat, it was a neat surprise to see that Google has put the entire Play Store within view while wearing a Daydream headset.\n\nThe Google Play Store takes on a familiar look in the VR space, with each individual app having its own rating and description. Google has also added the level of motion that you'll experience within each app, just so that you know what sort of immersion you're about to get yourself into.\n\nPerformance\n\nDaydream requires these three pillars in order to be a viable VR option: smartphones that are optimized for VR, with a high quality system on chip (SoC) to maintain 60 frames-per-second playback, low persistence displays to eliminate ghosting and lag, and finally, top-notch sensors that operate with minimal latency to boost the sense of presence.\n\nSo, what sort of performance can we reasonably expect out of it? Well, you'd be right to think that it really depends on the power of the phone that's inside.\n\nGoogle's new Pixel and Pixel XL phones pack a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and 4GB of RAM as well as running a FHD (1080p) screen on the Pixel and a QHD (2K) screen on the Pixel XL. You can bet that these devices will be primed to push high-quality VR experiences.\n\nBut, let's say that you have one of the upcoming Daydream Ready phones and power isn't much of an issue. Sources have suggested that Daydream will provide better performance than the Gear VR, but (understandably) not as good as what the Rift or Vive can push.\n\nAs time goes on, bringing more powerful systems on a chip (SoC) and pixel dense screens along with it, Daydream will begin to play ball on the same court as PC-tethered headsets. But that's not to say that it won't be showing some serious promise out of the gate.\n\nUnity and Epic each announced their support for Daydream, which will open the door for game developers to push their next projects out for Google's new VR platform.\n\nGoogle is making Android Nougat as VR-friendly as possible. To do that, the Daydream team worked closely with the core Android team to build VR mode, consisting of some new features that will help squeeze high levels of performance out of your daily driver.\n\nFirst off, low latency support is coming to Android Nougat to help your actions, like head or controller movements, appear onscreen with minimal delay. Next up, there's a new sustained performance mode to help phones stay at that high level of performance for a longer duration of time than we've seen previously in Cardboard, a notorious battery sucker.\n\nNougat will take full advantage of your Daydream Ready phone's sensors with new head-tracking algorithms. And, to keep you in the viewer when a call or text comes through, Google has ported several elements of N's user interface into Daydream.\n\nDaydream + Project Tango\n\nProject Tango is Google's ambitious VR/AR technology that packs all of the fanciest features you've seen in the Microsoft HoloLens into a tablet, or in Lenovo and Intel's case, some very large phone.

The snippet quotes from, and includes a link to, the Wikipedia article for “pathological lying.”\n\nBy early Monday morning, the image had been removed from the Google search.\n\nPart of what made the result odd is that while Mrs. Clinton has been accused of dishonesty and dissembling for the entire quarter-century since she became a national political figure as first lady, the Wikipedia article itself doesn’t mention her or any specific cases of dishonesty by her.\n\nHowever, the Talk page at the Wikipedia article on the subject suggested the solution lay there.\n\nOne unnamed editor stated flatly that “Pathological lying = Hillary Clinton” a comment that was later deleted, as was an illustrative photo of Mrs. Clinton that the page reportedly contained at one point Sunday night.\n\nAccording to Google’s description of the featured snippet, “when we recognize that a query asks a question, we programmatically detect pages that answer the user’s question, and display a snippet as a featured snippet in the search results.”\n\nMrs. Clinton’s picture did not ever appear in searches for “pathological liar” or “pathological lies.”\n\nCopyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.

Those include a new revenue-sharing model that would give developers more money when users subscribe to a service via their apps — instead of keeping 70 percent of all revenue generated from subscriptions, publishers will be able to keep 85 percent of revenue, once a subscriber has been paying for a year.\n\nNow Google plans to up the ante at its app store: It will also move from a 70/30 split to 85/15 for subscriptions — but instead of requiring developers to hook a subscriber for 12 months before offering the better split, it will make it available right away.\n\nSources said Google has already been testing the new split with some entertainment companies (so has Apple, to some extent). ​Google started running the new model over a year ago with video services as a way to get Play subscriptions to work with its TV streaming offerings like the Cast dongle.\n\nIt's unclear when Google plans to roll out the new pricing plan.\n\nWhen it does happen, it will be a natural move for Google, which has pushed developers to invest in Android as much as Apple, where the higher-spending customers tend to be.\n\nThe Play unit is also a key part of Google's strategy to find revenue streams outside of ads.\n\nGoogle has already tried differentiating itself from Apple by giving app developers the ability to handle payments themselves and keep all of the revenue. Apple requires any payments made within the app to go through Apple's iTunes billing system — a point that still irks many publishers, though they won't say so out loud.\n\nMary Meeker on the state of the Internet", "Google's engineers just achieved a milestone in quantum computing: they’ve produced the first completely scalable quantum simulation of a hydrogen molecule.\n\nThat’s big news, because it shows similar devices could help us unlock the quantum secrets hidden in the chemistry that surrounds us.\n\nResearchers working with the Google team were able to accurately simulate the energy of hydrogen H2 molecules, and if we can repeat the trick for other molecules, we could see the benefits in everything from solar cells to medicines.\n\nThese types of predictions are often impossible for 'classical' computers or take an extremely long time – working out the energy of something like a propane (C3H8) molecule would take a supercomputer in the region of 10 days.\n\nTo achieve the feat, Google's engineers teamed up with researchers from Harvard University, Lawrence Berkeley National Labs, UC Santa Barbara, Tufts University, and University College London in the UK.\n\n\"While the energies of molecular hydrogen can be computed classically (albeit inefficiently), as one scales up quantum hardware it becomes possible to simulate even larger chemical systems, including classically intractable ones,\" writes Google Quantum Software Engineer Ryan Babbush.\n\nChemical reactions are quantum in nature, because they form highly entangled quantum superposition states. In other words, each particle's state can't be described independently of the others, and that causes problems for computers used to dealing in binary values of 1s and 0s.\n\nEnter Google's universal quantum computer, which deals in qubits – bits that themselves can be in a state of superposition, representing both 1 and 0 at the same time.\n\nTo run the simulation, the engineers used a supercooled quantum computing circuit called a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) – essentially a highly advanced modelling system that attempts to mimic our brain's own neural networks on a quantum level.\n\nCredit: Google\n\nWhen the results of the VQE were compared against the actual released energy of the hydrogen molecule, the curves matched almost exactly, as you can see in the graph above.\n\nBabbush explains that going from qualitative and descriptive chemistry simulations to quantitative and predictive ones \"could modernise the field so dramatically that the examples imaginable today are just the tip of the iceberg\".\n\nWe're dealing with the very first steps of modelling reality, and Google says we could start to see applications in all kinds of systems involving chemistry: improved batteries, flexible electronics, new types of materials, and more.\n\nOne potential use is modelling the way bacteria produce fertiliser. The way humans produce fertiliser is extremely inefficient in terms of the environment, and costs 1-2 percent of the world's energy per year – so any improvements in understanding the chemical reactions involved could produce massive gains.\n\nIt's still early days though, and while we've described Google's hardware as a quantum computer for simplicity's sake, there's still an ongoing debate over whether we've cracked the quantum computing code just yet.\n\nSome say Google's machine is still a prototype, part-quantum computer rather than the real deal. But while the scientists discuss the ins and outs of that argument, at least we're starting to reap the benefits of the technology – and can look forward to a near future where computing power is almost unimaginable.\n\nThe findings are published in Physical Review X.", "The amount of energy consumed by big data centers has always been a headache for tech companies. Keeping the servers cool as they crunch numbers is such a challenge that Facebook even built one of its facilities on the edge of the Arctic Circle. Well, Google has a different solution to this problem: putting its DeepMind artificial intelligence unit in charge and using AI to manage power usage in parts of its data centers. The results of this experiment? A 40 percent reduction in the amount of electricity needed for cooling, which Google describes as a \"phenomenal step forward.\"\n\nsavings of hundreds of millions of dollars\n\nAfter accounting for \"electrical losses and other non-cooling inefficiencies,\" this 40 percent reduction translated into a 15 percent reduction in overall power saving, says Google. Considering that the company used some 4,402,836 MWh of electricity in 2014 (equivalent to the amount of energy consumed by 366,903 US households), this 15 percent will translate into savings of hundreds of millions of dollars over the years. And when you remember that Google reportedly paid $600 million for UK-based DeepMind back in 2014, it seems the company's bet on AI will pay for itself before too long.\n\nA rough graph showing how using machine learning (ML) helped reduce power consumption in Google's data centers. (Image credit: DeepMind)\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg, DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis said that the specially designed neural networks control \"about 120 variables in the data centers,\" including \"the fans and the cooling systems and so on, and windows and other things.\" The AI worked out the most efficient methods of cooling by analyzing data from sensors among the server racks, including information on things like temperatures and pump speeds. DeepMind's engineers say the next step is identify where new data is needed to calculate further efficiencies, and to deploy sensors in those areas.\n\nAnd the company won't stop with Google's data centers. \"Because the algorithm is a general-purpose framework to understand complex dynamics, we plan to apply this to other challenges in the data centre environment and beyond in the coming months,\" said DeepMind in a blog post. \"Possible applications of this technology include improving power plant conversion efficiency [...], reducing semiconductor manufacturing energy and water usage, or helping manufacturing facilities increase throughput.\" Just don't tell the conspiracy theorists what we're putting artificial intelligence in charge of next.\n\nGOOGLE'S DEEPMIND MASTERED THE GAME OF GO", "Working from home is great, but it also has its drawbacks.

If you are constantly logged in to your Google account, and need a place to stash images you find in a search results page, here’s how Google Save can help.\n\nGoogle Save lets you tag saved items.\n\nSticking with the previous example, let’s say we’re looking for a Hello Kitty coloring page. As usual, you start with a Google image search and then click on the image you’re interested in.\n\nGoogle will then expand the image within the search results page. To the right are several buttons including Visit page, View image, Save, and View saved.\n\nClick on Save and the star in that button will change color signaling that the item is in Google Save. Now to see the image in Google Save, either click View saved or point your browser to Google.com/save. From here you can tag items for easier searching later or just get quick access to your saves. Keep in mind that Google Save really only saves links to stuff you find online.

If you're still deciding, take some inspiration from the most popular Google searches for self-improvement.\n\niQuanti, a data-driven digital marketing company, compiled a list of the most popular resolutions based on Google search terms occurring from January 2016 through October.\n\nHealth and Organization Beat Out Travel and Reading\n\nAccording to the data pulled from Google by iQuanti, these are the most popular New Year's resolutions:\n\nGet Healthy: 62,776,640 searches, a 13.77 percent increase over last year during the same time period, when it was searched 55,177,290 times.\n\nGet Organized: 33,230,420 searches, dipping by 7.41 percent compared to last year's tally of 35,888,700.\n\nLive Life to the Fullest: 18,970,210, spiking by 13.04 percent from last year, when it maxed at 16,782,030.\n\nLearn New Hobbies: 17,438,670 searches, up 4.72 percent from last year's total searches of 16,652,950.\n\nSpend Less/Save More: 15,905,290 searches, up 17.47 percent from 13,539,500 in 2016.\n\nTravel: 5,964,130 searches, down by 0.82 percent from 2015's 6,013,550,\n\nRead More: 4,746,560 searches, down 5.63 percent from last year's 5,029,790.\n\nGrand Total: 159,031,920, up by 6.67 percent from last year's searches, which numbered 149,083,810.\n\nNot Just Healthy, But Fit\n\nThat fact that getting healthy tops the list is no shocker — it's among the most tried and true New Year's resolutions. But this year, people are specifically interested in gyms fitness, rather than simply improving their health.\n\n\"There was a 315 percent increase around the search term 'gym' and a significant increase around fitness-related searches, which shows just how important people are taking physical fitness,\" said Sastry Rachakonda, CEO of iQuanti.\n\nBetter Googling Makes For Better Marketing\n\nGooglers were more specific and direct in their searches this year than in previous years, Rachakonda noticed, reflecting that they've become more adept at searching online, or perhaps more decided in what they want.\n\n\"People are searching in a more targeted way, which gives us the impression that people have a better idea of what they want are searching for,\" said Rachakonda.\n\n\"For instance, general search terms like 'bucket list,' which tends to be somewhat of an unclear search intent have gone down whereas specific searches [wherein] consumers ask detailed questions have risen. We feel that this is due to consumers having a better understanding and knowledge of what they want, which in turn allows brands the opportunity to better connect with their customers.\"\n\nFitness Retailers Seize the Day\n\nTaking note of the surging interest in fitness aspirations are gyms and other fitness-affiliated retailers. In this vein, consumers can expect a deluge of marketing from all sorts of brands.\n\n\"The 'get in shape/fitness' resolution impacts not only the obvious gym memberships, fitness app subscriptions, and the purchase of fitness equipment but also categories like activewear, athletic footwear, fitness trackers, etc.,\" said Lisa Walters, co-founder of the independent equity research and consulting firm Retail Eye.\n\n\"From our store checks, we see fitness goals drive purchasing in January at activewear/footwear retailers including Lululemon, Athleta, Dick's Sporting Goods, Target, Foot Locker, Finish Line, Champs, department stores, DSW, etc.\"\n\n\"For some of these retailers, January is almost a second Christmas in a sense that we see high shopper purchasing of activewear and footwear to kick off these resolutions. And despite January being a clearance month, these retailers are able to sell activewear/athletic footwear at full price or with little discount.\"\n\nCashing in on Savings Goals\n\nGyms and fitness retailers may have a clear advantage given that consumers are actively seeking them out via their Google searches, but now is an ideal time for virtually any brand that can connect to New Year's resolutions.\n\nTake Poshmark, for example: the mobile and online marketplace, where users can sell fashion wares, sees a spike this time of year. This is thanks in part to consumers maximizing an \"out with the old, in with the new\" philosophy, as well as a desire to earn some extra cash.\n\n\"Poshmark sees rapid growth from December to January, which is definitely unusual for traditional retail,\" said Kate Franco, senior director of merchandising at Poshmark. \"The first quarter of the year is by far Poshmark's best growth quarter, as people sell gifts they can't return or clean out their closets for the New Year, Poshmark typically sees listing volume increase by at least 50 percent in January alone.\"\n\nStaying Resolute Throughout 2017\n\nThere's a reason the same resolutions come up every year. Overall, we're terrible at seeing them through.\n\n\"[Research shows] that only about 8 percent of people actually achieve their New Year's goals,\" said Dr. John Agwunobi chief health and nutrition officer for Herbalife. \"After the holiday tradition of over-indulgence, we set out to rid our cabinets of junk food, hit the gym and start fresh, [but] some people tackle the problem too aggressively, with overly restrictive diets, or exercise regimes that they can't commit to, and soon give up their efforts.\"\n\nNot only should we not be too hard on ourselves when acting on our resolutions, we should also focus on making small, incremental changes to whatever it is we wish to improve.\n\n\"Think about what it is that you want in life and how is it that you can achieve it by taking baby steps,\" said Didi Wong, an integrative wellness and life coach. \"If it is to lose weight, could you simply take out all sodas from your diet? If it's to get back in shape, could you go for a walk or run beginning with just once a week?\"\n\nWong also recommends keeping track of your progress.\n\n\"Make it a habit to write down your resolutions or goals and put an action associated with the goal in your calendar,\" said Wong. \"For example, 'I need to lower my cholesterol so I will walk just a mile a day and eliminate seafood from my diet.' If it is in your calendar, you are more likely to do it.\"", "Allo may be the future of Google’s messaging efforts, but it’s Duo that will replace Hangouts as one of the preinstalled options on future Android phones.\n\nAn email about the change recently went out to partners that install Google Mobile Services on their phones. This is distinct from the Android Open Source Project, as enabling these services means agreeing to a license with Google that your phone will include this distinct bundle of apps. Basically, all devices with the Google Play Store are “Google Mobile Services” licensees, while other devices that have their own app stores don’t use the Google Mobile Services agreement. We rarely see those products here in the U.S., but Amazon’s Fire tablets are the most popular example.\n\nAccording to the message details, Google is dropping Hangouts from the list of apps that must be bundled on upcoming phones.\n\nToday, we are announcing that Google Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products. This change will take effect on December 1, 2016.\n\nIt sounds like the earlier indication that Hangouts would pivot to an enterprise function is coming to be. The curious change is that it’s Duo, not Allo, that’s become the replacement.\n\nGoogle must see video calling as the more pivotal market right now, a function that has often been lackluster for Hangouts. Pushing out Duo puts a FaceTime competitor to everyone who buys a future Android phones, enabling them to easily video chat with friends or family members across Android and iOS.\n\nWhy this matters: Duo is clearly the cool kid now when it comes to Google’s messaging efforts. I’d expect Allo to get similar bundling treatment at some point, especially since the company faces stiff competition from several messaging apps that are already hugely popular. Until then, it’s up to you to grab it from the Play Store.", "Google, Apple and Amazon aren’t just giant tech companies. They’re giant tech companies that use their size to “snuff out competition.”\n\nThat’s the charge levied by Elizabeth Warren in a speech the Massachusetts senator delivered today in Washington.\n\nWarren singled out three of tech’s biggest players in a speech about the perils of “consolidation and concentration” throughout the economy. It comes the day after Hillary Clinton, Warren’s recent stage-mate, laid out a “technology agenda” that seemed designed to please Silicon Valley.\n\nWarren had different beefs with Google, Apple and Amazon, but the common thread was that she accused each one of using its powerful platform to “lock out smaller guys and newer guys,” including some that compete with Google, Apple and Amazon.\n\nGoogle, she said, uses “its dominant search engine to harm rivals of its Google Plus user review feature;” Apple “has placed conditions on its rivals that make it difficult for them to offer competitive streaming services” that compete with Apple Music; and Amazon “uses its position as the dominant bookseller to steer consumers to books published by Amazon to the detriment of other publishers.”\n\n“Google, Apple and Amazon have created disruptive technologies that changed the world, and ... they deserve to be highly profitable and successful,” Warren said. “But the opportunity to compete must remain open for new entrants and smaller competitors that want their chance to change the world again.”\n\nNot included in Warren’s list: Facebook, which certainly has platform power that freaks out everyone in the media business.\n\nThen again, Facebook doesn’t have a home-grown product that competes with the product the media business creates — unless you want to argue that Facebook’s main product is the user-generated content it is now favoring over the stuff publishers make.\n\nReps for Google, Apple and Amazon all declined to comment.\n\nBut Spotify, which has complained about the fee Apple charges music services — and other services — that sign up subscribers using its iOS platform, was happy to comment. Here’s Jonathan Prince, who runs communications and public policy for the streaming music company:\n\n“Apple has long used its control of iOS to squash competition in music, driving up the prices of its competitors, inappropriately forbidding us from telling our customers about lower prices, and giving itself unfair advantages across its platform through everything from the lock screen to Siri. You know there’s something wrong when Apple makes more off a Spotify subscription than it does off an Apple Music subscription and doesn’t share any of that with the music industry. They want to have their cake and eat everyone else’s too.”\n\nWarren’s speech didn’t only go after the tech sector. Other targets included Walmart and Comcast, which owns a minority stake in Vox Media, which owns this site.\n\nHer main critique was directed at politicians and regulators she thinks have abandoned their responsibility to “restore and defend competition.” Warren doesn’t expect those same politicians to pass new legislation to fix any of this, but she does want them to “enforce our laws in the way Congress originally intended them to be enforced.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Warren has gone after some of Silicon Valley’s standard-bearers. Earlier this spring she laid into Uber and other “gig economy” companies; Clinton made her own critique of that sector last year.\n\nI can’t imagine that Warren’s newest words will reverberate in techland. It would be nice if they did.\n\nThe predominant mindset when it comes to competition in Silicon Valley is that the best tech company wins until it doesn’t, and is replaced by a competitor that does it better. When we do talk about competition, it tends to be about fights between giants, usually about little stuff. Hey! Why won’t Amazon sell Apple TVs?\n\nAnd when it comes to platforms, we usually hear that companies that have built enormously powerful platforms get to operate them any way they see fit — and that the people who built them are going to make the best decisions about this stuff, anyway.\n\nBut these things are enormously powerful platforms, built on the same internet that Silicon Valley says should be treated as a public utility. If the platform owners don’t want to end up with Washington regulating, say, the size of their app store fees, they ought to work hard to keep themselves in check.\n\nHere’s Warren in mad-as-hell mode at last year’s Code Conference:", "As explained at Google I/O this morning, the jacket contains a weave of the Jacquard interactive threading on the left arm, and there's a little Bluetooth-enabled loop you connect to the cuff of your jacket. That cuff lets your phone talk to the jacket, and you can configure exactly what gestures you want to work with which apps.\n\nThe on-stage demo showed that you can swipe to adjust the volume on your music, tap to change tracks, and use another gesture to get navigation directions from Google Maps. The idea is the built in interactions that bikers can use to control their phones safely while riding, as the Commuter jacket was originally designed as a biking jacket.\n\nThe jacket itself is made using Levis' standard manufacturing techniques and it doesn't need to be treated with any special care. It can be washed and worn and treated like any other garment; you just need to remove the Bluetooth cuff before washing it. And it's just the first garment that Levis is making with this tech -- the company wants to make athletic and business wear as well.\n\nDevelopers will have access to a host of APIs to make their apps work with Jacquard, and the hopes are that many apps will work with the garment by the time it ships. Right now it works with your calls and messaging apps, Google Play Music and Maps and third-party apps from Spotify and Strava.\n\nThe first Project Jacquard garment will ship from Levis in the spring 2017, but there's a \"beta test\" that will launch this fall. If it works as well as it seemed to in today's quick demo, it'll definitely be worth keeping an eye on.\n\nFor all the latest news and updates from Google I/O 2016, follow along here.", "Google Chrome is an essential tool for many of us, but it’s by no means perfect. A slowdown in performance is one of the criticisms often leveled against the browser. If you want to quickly improve the speed of Chrome and the sites you’re visiting without delving too deep into its inner workings, you should find this guide to be extremely useful.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe should mention keeping your version of Chrome up to date, which will give you the best possible performance, and running regular spyware and virus checks on your machine are a great way to get started. For some more advanced performance tweaks, you can also check out Chrome’s hidden flag settings.\n\n1) Cut down on the extensions\n\nThis might be an obvious tip, but it’s worth emphasizing—particularly because a lot of add-ons may not be visible on the toolbar, and you may have forgotten about them. Most extensions won’t slow down the browser too much, but if you let them pile up they can cause sluggishness and buggy behavior. Getting rid of ones you no longer need is good for browser security as well as performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGo to More tools then Extensions on the Chrome menu to see a full list. Disabling extensions should help a little but uninstalling them is your best bet (you can always put them back again later). Open up the Chrome Task Manager (Shift+Esc on Windows) to see which extensions and apps are hogging CPU time and memory space on your system.\n\n2) Add a small number of useful extensions\n\nThis sounds somewhat contradictory, but stick with us. If you install a small number of genuinely useful extensions, they can get Chrome feeling snappier. Take Google’s own Data Saver extension, for instance, which reroutes pages through Google’s servers and compresses the number of 1s and 0s arriving at your browser, resulting in faster load times overall.\n\nThen there are the third-party extensions that try and improve how Chrome deals with dozens of open tabs at once. OneTab, Tab Suspender and The Great Suspender can all cut down on memory usage and visual clutter at the same time, and there are others. You might have to experiment to find the one that gives you the best Chrome speed increase.\n\n3) Cut down on the plug-ins\n\nThis one is slightly more nuanced, as disabling plug-ins might break functionality on some sites while also speeding up your browsing experience. It’s a good idea to disable them one by one, if you can, and check that nothing is disastrously broken afterwards. Note that you can’t fully uninstall Chrome plug-ins from the browser, only stop them from running.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSponsored\n\nType chrome://plugins into your browser to review what’s installed, and with a little detective work you should be able to work out what’s safe to disable and what isn’t. Blocking some plug-ins can stop videos from autoplaying, for example, and you can generally cut down on the number of processes and tools running in the background.\n\n4) Clear out the cache\n\nThere’s some debate over whether clearing the cache can actually speed up your browser. After all, the cache is designed to load pages and elements more quickly, but like many other parts of your system it can become bloated and unwieldy over time, meaning Chrome has to do more work to dig out the cached files and cookies it’s actually after.\n\nFrom the Chrome Settings tab, choose Show advanced settings and then Clear browsing data. From the dialog that appears, choose cookies and cached files, plus any other bits of data you want to blitz, from the beginning of time. Some sites may load more slowly the next time you visit but as a whole the cache should be much more streamlined than it was.", "Google just bought a small Internet service provider called Webpass. The search giant wants a little extra help in expanding the reach of Google Fiber, its own ultra-high-speed Internet service. But there’s a little-noticed detail in this merger that could be more significant than the purchase of any single ISP. Google is now getting a firsthand look at a new wireless technology that aims to radically change the way the Internet is delivered.\n\nThat’s because Webpass is helping to test something called pCell, a wireless antenna developed by serial Silicon Valley entrepreneur Steve Perlman and his latest company, Artemis Networks. Perlman’s pCell works by serving up a kind of cell-signal bubble that follows you around, an approach Perlman believes could dramatically improve cellular network speeds.\n\nGoogle and Perlman both declined to discuss the Webpass acquisition, though Perlman did say in an email that Artemis is excited to continue working with Webpass as it merges with Google Fiber. One way or another, it seems, these three companies are coming together. And together, the three serve as a powerful symbol for a rapidly approaching shift in how everyone gets online.\n\nToday, most Internet services—both in-home and wireless—come straight from telecom giants like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast. These companies have built their networks as they’ve seen fit, and they set the rules for using them. But Google and Facebook are changing this dynamic. Their massive online businesses can’t grow and evolve unless the Internet grows and evolves, and they believe the telecoms aren’t moving fast enough.\n\nBoth Google and Facebook are now building all kinds of tech for expanding the reach and improving the speed of the Internet, from new wireless antennas to drones and high-altitude balloons. And Google is operating as a straight-up Internet service provider. With Google Fiber, it provides ultra-high-speed broadband to businesses and homes. And with the newer Project Fi, it offers a service that lets you automatically move between different wireless networks, grabbing the best signal at any given moment.\n\nA future where wireless customers gain independence from any single carrier is the path pCell is pushing down. And it could help Google push down the same path.\n\nBuilding a Better Internet\n\nA typical celluar wireless antenna covers an area with a single signal, or cell, that all phones share. With pCell, multiple antennas transmit signals that combine to create a “personal cell” that follows you around. Since this cell is yours and yours only, you get all the bandwidth. In theory, this means a much better signal—a signal up to 1,000 times faster, according to Perlman.\n\nNokia Networks, which helps build so many of the world’s wireless networks, very much believes in pCell and is now running tests. Separately, Artemis is testing these antennas in San Francisco, and Webpass is helping out. The Google-acquired company is installing pCells on apartment and office buildings where it already provides broadband service. These antennas plug into Webpass’ broadband so that data can travel from a phone to the antenna to the Webpass gear to the wider Internet—and back again.\n\nGoogle is getting a firsthand look at new wireless tech that could change how the Internet is delivered.\n\nOriginally, Perlman talked about selling antennas to the likes of Verizon and AT&T. But he’s now exploring other options. He could bootstrap his own network, either through partners like Webpass—or even you and me. He envisions people with super-fast home Internet connections—like, say, Google Fiber—plugging into pCells, essentially turning their homes into cell towers (and taking a cut of the revenue).\n\nBy installing antennas on both homes and commercial buildings, Artemis could offer its own wireless service without going through AT&T or Verizon. Or it could just sell its available bandwidth to any wireless provider that needs it. If service is really poor for AT&T in a particular part of San Francisco, for example, pCell could provide a significant boost.\n\nThat’s how pCell could dovetail with Google’s Project Fi. The whole idea of Google’s new wireless service is that it lets you move from network to network. It’s not about which network you’ve signed up with; it’s about whichever network is better where you are at that exact moment. Today, Google has deals with T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular. But it aims to expand. As Perlman and company erect more and more their pCell antennas, Project Fi could tap straight into this growing network. In this way, Google could bootstrap a far better Project Fi—even if AT&T and Verizon aren’t involved.\n\nAt the same time, pCell could also boost Google Fiber itself. Perlman’s antenna isn’t just a way of delivering signals to phones. It can also handle “backhaul,” the grunt work of moving Internal signals between, say, different businesses or homes. Webpass already does wireless backhaul using antennas from a company called Siklu, which send signals to the roof, and then wire lines carry this signal to the building below. But these antennas require a clear line of sight, which pCell’s don’t. By using pCell’s more efficient system for backhaul, the likes of Google Fiber could expand more quickly, since it wouldn’t need as many wires.\n\nAnd pCell isn’t the only option. Siklu’s Boris Maysel says the company has other ways of delivering signals that aren’t so prone to interference. Facebook has built its own Internet antenna called Terragraph that it will soon deploy.\n\nIf they work as promised, all these antennas will provide better ways of delivering the Internet in cities and beyond. Even if Google doesn’t wind up using pCell, companies large and small are clearly at work seeking to accelerate the progress of the Internet’s underlying tech free from the control of any one provider. Whatever the specifics, that’s good news for everyone.", "Tired of waiting for Google to map the archipelago, Faroe Islanders have launched Sheep View 360, enlisting their ovine population to do the leg work\n\nLiving across 18 tiny sub-polar islands in the north Atlantic, Faroe islanders are used to working in difficult conditions. So tired of waiting for Google Street View to come and map the roads, causeways and bridges of the archipelago, a team has set up its own mapping project – Sheep View 360.\n\nWith the help of a local shepherd and a specially built harness built by a fellow islander, Durita Dahl Andreassen of Visit Faroe Islands has fitted five of the island’s sheep with a 360-degree camera.\n\nAs the sheep walk and graze around the island, the pictures are sent back to Andreassen with GPS co-ordinates, which she then uploads to Google Street View.\n\n“Here in the Faroe Islands we have to do things our way,” says Andreassen. “Knowing that we are so small and Google is so big, we felt this was the thing to do.”\n\nSo far the Sheep View team have taken panoramic images of five locations on the island. They have also produced 360 video so you can explore the island as if you are, quite literally, a sheep.\n\nThe islands have a population of 80,000 sheep and 49,188 humans.\n\nAs well as obviously helping promote the island to visitors, the project is part of a campaign to convince Google to come to the island to complete the mapping project. Visit Faroe Islands have launched a petition and the hashtag #wewantgooglestreetview to promote its case.\n\nBut would Google Street View ruin the beauty that comes from being such an isolated place? “I think that we’re ready for this,” says Andreassen. “It’s a place that has always been so hidden and far away from everything, but I think that we are ready to invite people to the place.”\n\nGuardian Travel contacted Google to ask if they had any plans to map the Faroe Islands. They would not comment, but pointed out that anyone is welcome to create their own Street View experiences and apply to borrow Google’s camera equipment.\n\nIt’s not the first time a project has brought together Google Street View and sheep. Last year the Google Sheep View blog was launched, which collected images of sheep found on Street View to celebrate the year of the sheep.", "Allo, the messaging service Google announced today at its Google I/O conference, is designed to allow a new style of communication, in which a clever bot listens in on your conversations and offers helpful suggestions and services. But a different feature is just as significant, one that’s designed to let no one listen in on your conversations at all: Not Google, not any hacker or eavesdropper, not even an FBI agent with a warrant.\n\nWhen it launches this summer, Allo will offer an “incognito” mode that switches on an end-to-end encryption system known as Signal, designed by the privacy-focused non-profit Open Whisper Systems. In that incognito mode, only the two phones at either end of a conversation will possess the secret keys necessary to decrypt messages. Google’s new video calling app Duo will use end-to-end encryption, too. The result is a pair of tools that are resistant to government surveillance: Google couldn’t, in theory, help law enforcement decipher an incognito Allo conversation or Duo call even if it wanted to. And in the wake of Apple’s landmark fight with the FBI over the encrypted iPhone of San Bernadino killer Syed Rizwan Farook, the move represents another step in Silicon Valley’s shift toward user-controlled encryption in defiance of law enforcement.\n\n“With incognito mode, Allo gives users additional controls over their privacy and security,” said Erik Kay, a Google engineering director in the Google I/O keynote. “We anticipate adding even more security features to it over time.”\n\nIn Allo’s incognito mode, the app will offer Snapchat-style expiring messages that delete themselves after a set time or when a conversation window is closed. And by adopting the open-source encryption system developed for the encrypted voice and messaging app Signal, the app will gain a level of protection from eavesdroppers that’s resistant to even sophisticated spies. Edward Snowden himself has vouched for Signal, writing that he uses it every day. As ACLU lead technologist Chris Soghoian has written, “every time someone downloads Signal and makes their first encrypted call, FBI Director Jim Comey cries.”\n\nBetter Late Than Never\n\nBut in the encryption arms race, Google is playing catch-up. Apple’s iMessage has, without much fanfare, end-to-end encrypted iPhone owners’ communications for years. FaceTime, too. In April, Facebook-owned Whatsapp completed the rollout of Open Whisper Systems’ encryption to the more than one billion phones that have the app installed, the largest default end-to-end encrypted network ever. The competing app Viber followed up just weeks later with its own switch to end-to-end encryption, extending that protection to around 700 million more people.\n\nGoogle’s move, late as it may come, answers critics who have chastised its slow adoption of user-controlled encryption tools. The company announced an encrypted email project called “End-to-End” in 2014, but the initiative has yet to release any actual tools to the public.\n\nYou must purposefully turn on incognito mode to send encrypted Allo messages; the app doesn’t hide all messages by default.\n\nAllo’s incognito mode represents a far more limited approach to encryption than Whatsapp’s, Apple’s, Viber’s, or even what it’s offering with Duo: Unlike with those apps, you must purposefully turn on incognito mode to send encrypted Allo messages; the app doesn’t hide all messages by default. On the flip side, Duo is encrypted by default all the time. But Google’s launching its encrypted communication apps as new tools that may or may not catch on, rather than Whatsapp’s far bolder move to turn on encryption for its existing, massive userbase. Gmail and Google Hangouts, meanwhile, still lack end-to-end encryption, leaving them open to government surveillance orders.\n\nWhatsApp delivered end-to-end crypto, turned on by default, to a billion people. Google is offering opt-in crypto via an app with zero users — Christopher Soghoian (@csoghoian) May 18, 2016\n\nHey @google, what the shit? You support encryption? Turn it on by default, or don't bother playing. https://t.co/J3BCXVkQ40 — Nate Cardozo (@ncardozo) May 18, 2016\n\nSeeking a Middle Ground?\n\nEven so, Google’s new experiments in end-to-end encryption represent the company tiptoeing into an increasingly heated debate between Silicon Valley and cryptophobic government officials in the US and abroad. In March, Brazilian authorities briefly arrested a Facebook executive after Whatsapp failed to comply with a surveillance order in a drug case. The country’s government temporarily banned the app in both December of last year and earlier this month due to its encryption features, although the ban was overturned in both cases by a judge. And the New York Times reported that Whatsapp had told the U.S. Justice Department it couldn’t comply with a wiretap order in a criminal investigation due to its use of encryption.\n\nFBI director James Comey has made clear his opposition to encryption because it presents a barrier to law enforcement, saying as early as 2014 that encrypted communication “threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place.” When Whatsapp announced the completion of its encryption rollout in April, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, a member of the Senate’s Select Committee on Intelligence, responded in a blistering statement: “The WhatsApp and Facebook decision to add end-to-end encryption to all of WhatsApp’s services with no secure method to comply with valid search warrants continues a dangerous trend in the tech and data world,” he wrote. “This is an open invitation to terrorists, drug dealers, and sexual predators to use WhatsApp’s services to endanger the American people.”\n\nGoogle’s more limited adoption of that same encryption system may signal that the company is looking for a path that will please its privacy-seeking users without entirely antagonizing law enforcement. An even bigger consideration for the company may be the fact that end-to-end encryption prevents not only government surveillance, but its own collection of data about its users’ conversations—the lifeblood of Google’s advertising-driven business.\n\nAllo and Duo’s new security features, in other words, are Google’s baby steps towards a fully-encrypted future, not the sort of bold moves to elevate privacy above profit or politics that some of its competitors have already taken. But for a company built on a data collection model that’s often fundamentally opposed to privacy, baby steps are better than none at all.", "The building that houses Google’s Advanced Technology and Products division offers a few subtle hints that something weird is going on inside. The pirate flags in the bathroom. The big sign reminding ATAP employees to always erase their whiteboards after a meeting. The workers who encounter me milling around in the entryway on a warm day just before the big Google I/O conference, each more worried than the last about what a stranger is doing here. Rick Osterloh, Google’s newly hired hardware boss, comes rushing out of the building to head to his next meeting with a big smile on his face, but even he won’t let me in.\n\nEventually, a handler shows up and ushers me into a conference room. The whiteboards are indeed empty, except for a single phrase that appears to have been written in something permanent: “Aim High.” Dan Kaufman, once the director of innovation at Darpa and the new head of ATAP, sits across the table along with three of the men in charge of one of the most ambitious ideas inside Google’s haven for ambitious ideas: Project Ara, the modular smartphone. Depending on who you ask, and maybe on the day, Ara is either the future of the phone—a forever-lasting, totally personal device—or an impossible pipe dream.\n\nIt’s been more than a year since Google showed Ara to the public, and a lot has changed. The mission hasn’t: Build a smartphone out of interchangeable parts that you can swap on the fly to make your phone exactly what you want right this second. Add a wide-angle camera module for your hike. Swap it for a telephoto—and add a larger battery—for the soccer game. Replace the screen with an E Ink display for reading on a long flight. The idea is, the ability to swap modules would lengthen the life of a smartphone—devices can last five years instead of two—and lessen the waste accrued in the rush to upgrade.\n\nAfter years of failed demos, public sputters, and worrisome silence, Ara works. About 30 people within ATAP are using Ara as their primary phone.\n\nIt’s the how, not the what, that was problematic. Today, Rafa Camargo, Ara’s technical project lead, wants to show me what he’s made. He picks the black phone up from the white table in front of him, flips it over, and taps the power button. It turns on. Next, he picks up a camera module from the table, pops it into the phone, opens the camera app, and quickly takes a crisp photo. “There’s your camera, live,” Camargo says.\n\nHang on. You caught that, right? It works! After years of failed demos, public sputters, and worrisome silence, Ara works. About 30 people within ATAP are using Ara as their primary phone. Camargo actually has the luxury of worrying about things like aesthetics, rather than whether it’ll turn on. “Please pay no attention to how it looks,” he tells me, flipping the blocky smartphone over in his hands, “because it’s a prototype.” It’s not a concept, not an idea, not a YouTube video. It’s a prototype. Developer kits for Ara will be shipping later this year, and a consumer version is coming in 2017. “We have now built all the key components of the platform,” Camargo says. Ara is no longer an experimental part of ATAP: It just became its own division within Google. Now it’s time to find out if there’s room left for another smartphone revolution.\n\nFinding the Starting Point\n\nGoogle wants to open up smartphone innovation by creating an ecosystem anyone can contribute to. Mobile is the largest technology platform in history, but to get in, you either need the resources and experience of an Apple or a Samsung, or you need to be convincing enough to get Apple or Samsung to bet on your technology. “What currently happens in the market is, you get great products that are all set for you, like, ‘Oh, that’s what you want, right?'” says Blaise Bertrand, ATAP’s master of creative. (That’s really his title.)\n\nAra could blow all that up by blowing your smartphone up: It wouldn’t have to one be one thing you buy in full every two years, it could be a dozen pieces you replace if and when you need them. You could buy a better speaker, and I could buy a better camera. It all sounds wonderful, but Ara’s path to completion was anything but clear. They made enough progress that at last year’s Google I/O, Camargo managed to snap a grainy photo of the audience with a hot-swapped camera module. And then the team went dark. Other than a few stray tweets, that photo was the last anyone saw of Ara.\n\nSince then, Paul Eremenko, the team’s leader, left Google. So did Regina Dugan, who quit running ATAP to start something similar at Facebook. Google reorganized and consolidated its hardware efforts under Osterloh. Within Ara, the team scrapped testing and rollout plans, which (weirdly) involved selling Ara modules out of a converted food truck in Puerto Rico. After lots of research and testing, they made a big decision: rather than turn every single piece of the phone into modules, from the processor to the RAM to the hard drive, they’d consolidate all that into the standard frame. They found that people don’t care about, or want to think about, the processor in their phone. And they especially don’t want to worry about it being compatible with all their apps. Users just want a good phone with good specs that does all the basics well, and then they want a place to play on top of that.\n\nYour Dream Machine\n\nThe Ara Developer Edition shipping later this year is a 5.3-inch, fairly high-end smartphone. You’ll be able to take it out of the box, turn it on, and use it like a normal Android phone. A big, thick Android phone with a bunch of weird exposed ports, but normal nonetheless.\n\nThe parts required to make a good smartphone are pretty cheap and entirely commoditized; instead of “screen” being the base module, now “phone parts” is the starting point. “The key here,” Camargo says, “is to develop the functionality you don’t get on your smartphone today. I’ll give you the smartphone, so you don’t have to worry about it.”\n\nOver the last year or so, the team also worked to standardize the modules, so that developers could actually start to build them. The key bit was redesigning the connectors on the back. Each one has to support constant connecting and reconnecting, charge things when they get plugged in, and, you know, not break or fall off. They created a proprietary port, but one that uses an open standard, UniPro. The phone has six, and each one can push up to 11.9 gigabits of data per second, in both directions. Ara chief Richard Woolridge spits out crazy edit-video-while-you-computer-vision use cases, but says the spec boils down to this: It can handle anything. And it only consumes a third as much power as USB 3.\n\nPress a button on the right side of the phone to bring up a map of all your modules, tap on the picture of the one you want to release, then flip over your phone, A moment later, it releases. Or do it like Camargo and say, “OK Google, eject the camera.” Doing everything in software prevents mechanical accidents or failures, and even lets users do things like password-protect sensitive modules. And, of course, there’s nothing to adding a new one: just pop it in.\n\nModular Thinking\n\nWhich brings us to the most important question still facing Project Ara: what the hell kind of modules are people going to build? Woolridge and his team took their user research to the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona in February, where they started showing it to potential partners: carriers, tech companies, fashion brands, everyone.\n\nIt’s been years since we’ve had anything like true experimentation and newness in smartphones. The stakes are so high and the scale is so big, no one can afford to take chances.\n\nTurns out they all have ideas. Better speakers, flashlights, panic buttons, fitness trackers, projectors, app-shortcut buttons, kickstands, a million other things. Some are incredibly high-tech—pro-level cameras clearly fascinate the Ara team, and they all get excited at the idea of replacing my hideous tape recorder with a microphone module—but some aren’t. Bertrand shows me a small compact case for storing makeup, and a small hollow pillbox. They’re also building “style” modules, which don’t do anything except look nice. Apparently, when given the opportunity to make anything that plugs into their phone, people come up with some pretty useless ideas.\n\nAnd that’s OK: it’s the whole point. It’s been years since the smartphone industry has seen anything like true experimentation and newness. The stakes are so high and the scale is so big, no one can afford to take chances. With Ara, the industry can go back to throwing shit against the wall, looking to see what else might work.\n\nUltimately, the modules are much more important than the frame they go in. The first Ara device is a smartphone because that’s the biggest market. But Camargo reminds me that anything bigger than the smallest module, which right now is about half the size of a stick of gum, could be an Ara device. An Ara tablet isn’t a crazy idea, nor is a teeny-tiny Internet of Things Ara device. Anything with a connector works, Camargo says. “That allows us to be somewhat form-factor independent.”\n\nFor right now, though, the smartphone is the thing. While we talk, Bertrand slides another Ara phone over to me, a non-working prototype that looks more like what they’re going for. It’s still thicker and chunkier than they’d like, but Bertrand is confident than thin and clean are adjectives he can work with. The phone is wearing a light blue backplate that I can swap out, and has a dozen or so modules to choose from. Screens, cameras, one that’s the color of (but hopefully not made of) concrete, a picture of someone’s dog. I start playing with options, trying to figure out exactly what works for me. I need a camera, obviously. And the E Ink screen is cool. But I don’t want to clutter it too much, so I drop in two wooden modules just to keep things looking nice.\n\nBefore he handed it to me, Bertrand had it set up completely differently. And whoever tries it next will do something else. There are thousands of combinations possible. Of all the people the team has invited so far to build their own Ara phone as part of its research, no two people have picked exactly the same things.\n\nAra has come a long way, but the biggest test comes later this year. Woolridge doesn’t know how many Developer Editions he expects to sell, except that he expects a lot. It’s going to be a high-end device, at least at first, because that’s where they feel like the market really needs a kick in the pants. (That, and making cool new stuff for cheap is hard to do.) There’s lots more to do, on design and software and branding and ecosystem-building. And, of course, they have to find out if anyone actually wants to buy this thing. But they’ve already done something special. Toward the end of our conversation, I look over and see Camargo just idly fiddling with his Ara. Not testing, not debugging, fiddling. It’s just his phone now.", "Google's Project Zero team searches for \"zero-day\" code flaws and gives companies 90 days (plus a two week grace period) to fix them. In this case, Ormandy published the blog post shortly after Symantec pushed the fixes, saying the antivirus company did resolve the bugs \"quickly.\"\n\nHowever, he excoriated Symantec for the danger of the errors and its incompetence in allowing them. In one case, he found a buffer overflow flaw in the company's \"unpacker,\" which searches for hidden trojans and worms. \"Because no interaction is necessary to exploit it, this is a wormable vulnerability with potentially devastating consequences,\" he says. \"An attacker could easily compromise an entire enterprise fleet.\" He added that the unpackers have kernel access, which is \"maybe not the best idea.\"\n\nLightRocket via Getty Images\n\nThe researcher built and released his own exploit to help Symantec develop an effective fix.

It's called Area 120, a nod to its famous latitude for \"20 percent\" employee side projects.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai confirmed it to Forbes following earlier reports from The Information.

Similar ideas have percolated there for some time — the associate manager program that trained inexperienced new hires, Google X, the whole Alphabet thing.\n\nSeveral venture capitalists and former Googlers I spoke to when Area 120 first surfaced believed Google has better odds than earlier efforts. For example, Yahoo tried (then failed) with its own incubator, Brickhouse, which Horowitz helped run nearly a decade ago.\n\nBut they were skeptical that the new endeavor would breed really innovative companies.\n\n\"Startups need a certain amount of risk,\" said one former Googler. \"If you can fall back on your vesting or job at Google, I'm not sure that cuts it.\"\n\nThat said, here are a couple areas where building a startup inside Google instead of outside might make sense.\n\nAdvertising tech : It's hard to find funding for that now, but Google needs the tech.\n\n: It's hard to find funding for that now, but Google needs the tech.

Fortunately, the latest release has fixed it, and we can all rejoice in the task of easily saving files directly to Google Drive.\n\nUnfortunately, all is not perfect. Attempting to save directly to Google Drive does have one caveat...it's one that has haunted this feature since 5.1. If you have two-factor authentication set up, chances are you won't have any luck. Of course, you should have two-step authentication set up.\n\nHowever, on the off-chance you do not have this extra layer of security enabled on your Google account, you can make this connection happen.

As you save the opened file, it will automatically save to the remote file and not as a local copy.\n\nMultiple services\n\nYou can have LibreOffice set up for multiple services. If you added various cloud services in the Remote Files tool, you'll be prompted to select a service when either saving or opening a file.\n\nFrom the Remote Files window, select which remote server to connect to from the Service drop-down (Figure D) and then, if required, enter the password for that service. You should be good to go.\n\nFigure D\n\nImage: Jack Wallen\n\nThat two-factor authentication caveat\n\nThe only thing holding the remote server support feature back is two-factor authentication. For many like myself, two-factor authentication is a must-use feature for cloud storage (as well as social networking and any other online service).\n\nUntil LibreOffice can take care of this hiccup, I highly recommend you opting to connect via SSH, WebDAV, or Windows Share. Hopefully, in the next release, we'll see two-factor authentication finally working with this outstanding LibreOffice feature.\n\nAutomatically sign up for TechRepublic's The Cloud Revolution for more hot tips and tricks.

These days though, plenty of businesses consider themselves a part of that sector. Take the CEO of Goldman Sachs, who refers to the financial firm as a tech company. Furthermore, coding has become the most important job skill across industries. As the LinkedIn report notes, with every company going through a tech-driven transformation, “being a talent magnet is going to be what separates the winners from the also-rans.” Photo: courtesy of Google Google cinched the top spot among the 40 top attractors. In addition to perks like free meals and massages along with a culture that supports diversity and the creation of the “perfect” team, Google has no trouble drawing candidates. One former Google recruiter estimated that he reviewed 3 million resumes in one year. But what does it really take to get a job at the top organizations? Tech knowledge, is of course, a requirement. However, Chris Bolte, the cofounder and CEO of Paysa, a big-data platform providing market insight about compensation and retention, says he’s seeing another trend that is clinching jobs for those without a traditional computer science degree. “The most explosive growth we’re seeing is the emergence of deep learning,” says Bolte. He explains, “It’s a branch of machine learning and artificial intelligence leveraging what are called neural networks.” At its simplest, the neural network functions like a web of interconnected brain cells inside a computer that can parse signals from images or video, for example. It can learn to recognize patterns and make decisions in a human way.\n\nBolte explains that deep learning extends a number of layers “deeper” than what was previously computationally feasible. He says given the amount of data Internet giants create, coupled with the advancement of computing, these deep learning methods are able to model signals more completely. Artificial intelligence and machine learning as broader skills offer opportunity to a variety of tech talent. In a recent interview with Fast Company, senior machine learning recruiter at Microsoft Amanda Papp revealed: “Not everyone has to have that PhD in computer science. We have folks that have more physics backgrounds or biomathematics or permutational biology. [Machine learning] doesn’t necessarily have to have that standard comp-sci path.” Paysa’s data shows that programming is still in high demand. At Google, for example, nearly half (45%) of its 60,000 employees know Java, and 42% know Python. Only 13% are knowledgeable in Git (open source software development), and 14% have skills in cloud computing. The majority (83%) of employees at Google have a bachelor’s degree, but only 7% come from Stanford. Other schools include Colorado School of Mines, Carnegie Mellon, and University College Dublin. The No. 2 company on the list, Salesforce, has 20,000 people on staff, but their top skills are somewhat different than those at Google. As many as 46% know cloud computing and 39% are versed in agile methodologies (project management for software development). Eighty percent hold bachelor’s degrees and draw from schools such as University of California Berkeley, Southeast University, Arizona State, and University of Illinois at Urbana. Photo: courtesy of Facebook At Facebook, programming languages are in demand. Paysa data indicates that 46% of Facebook employees know Java and 44% know Python. Other top skills include C++, distributed systems, algorithms, and machine learning. Similar to the other two companies, most employees (84%) have a four-year degree, but 42% of Facebookers hold master’s degrees, too. This lends credence to recent research that more employers are looking to hire candidates with advanced degrees. However, Apple isn’t pushing for higher education among all of its workforce. Only 71% of its 100,000 employees earned bachelor’s degrees, and 28% report not having a degree at all. This is due, in part, to the fact that not every employee is working on development in its Cupertino headquarters. This can also be seen in the most prevalent skill among Apple’s ranks, software development (28%), with Java coming in second at 27%. Photo: courtesy of Amazon Rounding out the LinkedIn top five is Amazon. The e-commerce juggernaut draws many of its staffers from nearby University of Washington in Seattle, and 83% of its employees hold bachelor’s degrees. More than half (57%) know Java, and 45% are skilled in software development.

And the company expects the changes to roll out by the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\nWhile it says Flash might have \"historically\" been a good way to present rich media online, Google is now much more partial to HTML5, thanks to faster load times and lower power use.\n\nAs a result, Flash will still come bundled with Chrome, but \"its presence will not be advertised by default.\" Where the Flash Player is the only option for viewing content on a site, users will need to actively switch it on for individual sites. Enterprise Chrome users will also have the option of switching Flash off altogether.\n\nGoogle will maintain support in the short-term for the top 10 domains using the player, including YouTube, Facebook, Yahoo, Twitch and Amazon. But this \"whitelist\" is set to be periodically reviewed, with sites removed if they no longer warrant an exception, and the exemption list will expire after a year.\n\nA spokesperson for Adobe said it was working with Google in its goal of \"an industry-wide transition to Open Web standards,\" including the adoption of HTML5.\n\n\"At the same time, given that Flash continues to be used in areas such as education, web gaming and premium video, the responsible thing for Adobe to do is to continue to support Flash with updates and fixes, as we help the industry transition,\" Adobe said in an emailed statement. \"Looking ahead, we encourage content creators to build with new web standards.\"\n\nThis article also appears in Spanish.

Podcasts are available from the Music app's main menu alongside options for top music charts, your library, new releases and more. You don't have to download another app and futz with the setup since podcasts appear just like other streaming content. As you might expect, the main podcast landing page is a top chart of the popular shows across all categories.\n\nThere's a handy drop-down menu for categories above the list of popular podcasts, allowing you to filter out everything but the comedy options, for example. Each show tile on the web has a play button so you can fire up the latest episode immediately as well as options for subscribe and share. On mobile, you actually have to select a show and head to its page before you're able to hit play.\n\nOn that main podcast page, there's also a tab for \"Your Podcasts,\" where all the shows you've subscribed to reside. That personal library is a mirror image of the top charts on the main page: a grid of artwork and show titles with quick-play functionality that starts with the latest episode. This tiled arrangement of podcast options is common in other apps, including Pocket Casts and others. Again, you'll have to tap through to a show's landing page to hit play on mobile. Here you'll also find a list of episodes with a brief description of the podcast itself.\n\nEach selection has the usual title, description, date and run time, but if you want to see the full episode notes, you'll have to click the information icon to browse them. Tapping that \"i\" icon also reveals the option to download an episode for offline listening inside the Play Music mobile app. Once you start an episode, the run time flips to show the time remaining if you're listening on a desktop, letting you know if you can finish what you started at the office during your evening commute. Unfortunately, that run time doesn't flip to a countdown on mobile, so the only way to see how much time is left is to swipe over to the audio player.\n\nThere are also podcast stations for all the times you can't decide what you want to hear. Despite a mention and active links in Google's announcement post, I wasn't able to find the podcast stations inside the Music app. I think this could be a great tool for discovery, but right now it's difficult to find on both the web and mobile. Stations function the exact same way as stations for Google Play's music streaming (or any service, really), only the playlist is composed of podcasts instead of songs. For example, the \"Learn Something New\" option pulls content from shows like Stuff You Should Know, Planet Money and How Your World Works.\n\nIf you've used Play Music before, you know exactly what to expect in terms of the player. The UI is the same as when you're streaming music or playing tunes from your library, complete with Google Cast support. The only difference is the addition of the \"skip back 10 seconds\" and \"skip ahead 30 seconds\" controls. Those controls are also available in the Android app on the main player interface and from the lock screen and by swiping down on the notifications bar. This means you won't have to navigate to the app to skip around or hit pause, which will come in handy if you're at the gym or using another app.\n\nWhen you start a playlist or album, a menu icon on the player interface offers easy access to the queue. Here you can see the list of episodes and play them without having to head back to the show page. Unfortunately, you can only clear that playlist, and when you hit play on one episode, it automatically populates with more episodes from the same show. There's no way to queue up the latest episode from It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's a Podcast to play after you finish listening to Welcome to Night Vale or to make a playlist so you won't be interrupted by trying to find another show.\n\nThe addition of podcasts isn't seamless, though, as some key features are missing that make apps like Pocket Casts so attractive. First, the search functionality is pretty terrible. If the podcast you're looking for has a rather unique name, chances are it will appear at the top. I had no trouble finding Good Beer Hunting, for example. However, if what you're after has some commonly used words in its name, you'll see results for albums, songs, radio stations and video first. The podcast results will be all the way at the bottom. Pocket Casts and Stitcher both handle search much better; however, they're only sorting through podcasts and not an entire streaming library. And no, there's no way to search just for podcasts in Play Music on the desktop or in the Android app. Bummer.\n\nThere are also a few notable omissions from the podcast library. Serial, Fresh Air, This American Life and others aren't available inside the app. It's a bit odd, because other NPR shows like Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me, Pop Culture Happy Hour and Bullseye show up in search results. For sports fans, only a smattering of local ESPN shows are available, so you'll have to go to the network's own app or another piece of software to stream those national radio episodes. I only listen to a handful of podcasts, and I was able to find them all save for two: Serial, which I already mentioned, and Men in Blazers from NBC Sports. Missing shows is one of the downsides to Spotify's podcast library as well, and it's the main reason I still use Pocket Casts.\n\nI have two main gripes with the new Play Music integration: the inability to build custom playlists and the omission of a number of popular shows. Dedicated podcast search wouldn't hurt, but I can survive without it. If a robust feature set is what you're after, Pocket Casts is probably still the best option on Android. It's worth the $4, in my opinion. Even so, Google's new podcast offering is a massive improvement over Stitcher, an app that goes down for days and sometimes weeks at a time.\n\nPodcasts are a welcome addition to the Google Play Music app on Android. Unfortunately, iOS users will have to wait to take advantage, and the company hasn't said when that will happen. Of course, podcasts have been a part of iTunes and iOS since the jump, and they're only now making it to Google's Music app. By nesting podcasts inside the Play Music app, Google provides a convenient way to access the episodic content -- as long as the shows you like are available there.", "At the Google Cultural Institute in Paris, Charlotte Fechoz is admiring Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night. The painting, of course, isn't here; it's been in the MOMA in New York since 1941. Instead, Fechoz - the co-ordinator of Le Lab, as the Paris workspace is known - is viewing the masterpiece on The Wall, an 18m-wide, two-storey-tall screen designed for viewing artworks at massive scale. The Starry Night, one of hundreds of masterpieces to have been scanned using Google's gigapixel Art Camera, is blown up to astonishing clarity.\n\n\n\n\"You can see the canvas has not been fully covered,\" Fechoz says, zooming in until a single brushstroke is rendered at twice her size. \"According to experts, that means van Gogh painted this in a rush. He had this feeling of necessity.\"\n\nIf Google's core search business is comparable to that of a library - to collect and organise all known information - then the Cultural Institute is its art gallery. \"We try to provide access, and we try to preserve,\" says Laurent Gaveau, the 39-year-old director of Le Lab. The nonprofit platform, he says, has a single mission: \"How can people be more engaged with art?\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLaunched in 2011 as the Google Art Project, the Cultural Institute sprang from \"20 per cent time\" projects by employees across Google's internal departments. Since broadened to include historical archives, street art and performing arts, it contains more than six million artworks, photos, videos and documents from 1,000 institutions including the British Museum and MoMA.\n\nAt first glance, Amit Sood, the Bombay-born director of the institute, makes an unlikely champion for the arts. \"I have zero background in art or history,\" says Sood, sitting in his London office. Growing up in India, Sood never went to museums. Only after moving abroad, doing engineering jobs in New York, Stockholm, Singapore and Belgium, did he become obsessed with museums as the best way to connect to his new bases. \"I found it a very cost-effective way of keeping myself entertained.\"\n\nREAD NEXT Max Cooper’s science-inspired music videos will blow your mind Max Cooper’s science-inspired music videos will blow your mind\n\nGoogle's gigapixel Art Camera reveals hidden details in Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night, such as these bare patches of canvas, only visible at close magnification. They may be indications that the artist painted it in a rush of activity MoMA, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest\n\nAt Google, Sood's experience initially prompted him to get in touch with museums in the hope of bringing their collections online. But persuading centuries-old institutions to open their collections initially proved difficult. \"There were three or four barriers to trust. The first one is: it's Google, you're going to come, take all this stuff and splash ads on it,\" says Sood.\n\nThe Cultural Institute was created as a non-profit; arts institutions are responsible for uploading their own content on to the site and retain control of copyright. \"They choose what goes on the platform, we don't.\" (The latter is significant, given the recent copyright controversy around Google Books - challenged by authors claiming the scanning of their works amounted to outright infringement rather than fair use, the US Supreme Court ruled in Google's favour in April. Google's arguments included that they made the books and academic papers more discoverable, without making the entire text available online.)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD NEXT If you hate clowns, you should probably avoid this terrifying new trailer for It If you hate clowns, you should probably avoid this terrifying new trailer for It\n\nAnother fear: that putting art online would reduce footfall in museums. \"We worked very hard to debunk this,\" says Sood. \"The only way we could do it was wait. The Art Newspaper reports year-on-year records in museum visits.\"\n\nThe visitors debate, Sood says, also illustrates a gulf between big-name tourist attractions and smaller institutions. \"When you talk to museums in remote areas, they're like 'sure',\" explains Sood. \"Their problem is that people don't know about them.\"\n\nIn Paris, Gaveau's team is developing tools to help audiences experience art in new ways. One of its first developments was the gigapixel Art Camera, which stitches together hundreds of up-close images to capture artworks in astonishing detail. The tool has captured dozens of works, from Munch's The Scream to the Chagall-painted dome of the Paris Opera.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD NEXT Forget customer-service teams, these automated systems will get you that refund Forget customer-service teams, these automated systems will get you that refund\n\n(The latter presented a challenge: the ceiling is obscured by an ornate chandelier, circumvented through innovative image stitching.) The results aren't just visually impressive. \"Curators come here to study paintings they have been studying for 30 years,\" says Fechoz. A recent scan of St Paul's Cathedral dome gave close-up access to work unattainable even to historians.\n\nThe institute has also pioneered indoor Street View, which began when Sood approached the Google Maps team to try to capture inside of galleries. The result: a custom-built 360° camera rig atop a moveable trolley, which enables virtual gallery tours. Since 2015, its archive has expanded to include live events such as the Venice Biennale. \"For the Grand Palais in Paris we did flying 3D capture, the trolley, the Trekker backpack for the stairs,\" recalls Gaveau. \"We even put a tripod on the roof.\"\n\nAmit Sood delivering his TED 2016 talk on using technology to put not only artworks online, but entire museums, to be explored in 3D VR Google\n\nOther creations are focused on discovering art in alternative ways. \"We have this database of millions of great assets, and we try to find ways to create new experiences,\" says Gaveau. One entertaining prototype is Portrait Matcher, which uses a webcam to analyse viewers' facial position and match it to one of the artworks in the database in real time. It's like a fine-art mirror; for kids, it could be a new way into otherwise dry areas of art history.\n\nREAD NEXT The best free documentaries to watch on YouTube The best free documentaries to watch on YouTube\n\nSome of Le Lab's work has had impact far beyond Paris. Cardboard, Google's low-cost VR headset, began as an experiment by Damien Henry and David Coz, two engineers working in the institute's Paris lab. (The lab's workspace is furnished in cardboard, a tribute to its most famous creation.) \"From the beginning, education and culture were at the core of the project,\" explains Henry. \"And now one million children get to experience VR in the classroom.\" In December 2015, the institute used Cardboard to launch performing arts on the platform, shooting VR films inside the Royal Shakespeare Company and Carnegie Hall.\n\n\"We want to be a bridge between culture and technologies like VR,\" says Sood.\n\nIn March, in partnership with the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Sood's team created a VR version of Bruegel's The Fall of the Rebel Angels. \"The idea is to step inside a painting,\" Henry says. \"To make a connection between you and a piece of art.\"\n\nBut Sood's vision goes beyond documentation. The lab is also experimenting with what the future of art might look like. In March 2016, Sood's team invited five world-renowned street artists to the lab to play around with Tilt Brush, a VR painting app (which Google acquired in 2015) for the HTC Vive. \"We decided to pick street artists at the beginning, because they know already how to draw in this very physical way,\" says Henry.\n\nREAD NEXT American Gods is coming to TV - here are the first pictures American Gods is coming to TV - here are the first pictures\n\nInside Tilt Brush, WIRED watches as the paintings are conjured in mid-air. Sketched outlines, with the addition of colour and shadow, become tangible objects floating in 3D space. Light and texture fill the previously blank room. Moving around inside each piece as they're being created - elaborate calligraphy galaxies, ornate mask sculptures, an exploding metal landscape bursting with light - feels remarkably like being inside an artist's mind. It's hard not to witness a Tilt Brush painting in progress and not suspect one might be witnessing the birth of a new art form.\n\nThe Tilt Brush experiments are not part of any Google master plan. For now, they're just a glimpse of what could be. \"We want the lab to be the place where we can do things that don't have an immediate takeaway,\" Sood says. (In April, the artworks were made available for those who own an HTC Vive; they're already planning to invite more artists to experiment with the app.) The same goes for its artists-in-residence programme, which includes a partnership with a young-artist initiative, 89plus, and has hosted the novelist and artist Douglas Coupland.\n\nREAD NEXT Don't think borders, think big: why Article 50 can't, and won't, stop the thriving Euro tech scene Don't think borders, think big: why Article 50 can't, and won't, stop the thriving Euro tech scene\n\nThe artist \"paints\" in the virtual space using a motion- and location-sensing controller, while wearing an HTC Vive headset Google\n\nIncreasingly, he says, the Cultural Institute isn't just moving art online; it's also moving into galleries. Portrait Matcher, The Wall and Cardboard have all been developed with physical spaces in mind. In Brussels, Cardboard headsets showing the Bruegel film are as much part of the exhibition as the paintings on show.\n\n\"We want to be a bridge between culture and technologies like VR,\" says Sood. \"Museums don't have a lot of money. We can be a place that can fund and source these experiences.\"\n\nAt the start of September, Google Arts & Culture partnered with more than 50 of the world’s leading natural history institutions to bring natural history displays to life online. More than 150 interactive stories from experts, 300,000 new photos and videos, and more than 30 virtual tours are now available.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a blog post, Google wrote: \"With just a few clicks, you can come face to face with a 180 million-year-old giant, as virtual reality raises the colossal sea dragon from extinction.

But if I say: hey, you want to see what bling used to be like in 1800? I think there's a lot of opportunity for disruption, for changing people's minds.\"", "Ed Parsons, Google’s geographer-in-chief, is leaning over an 18th century woodcut map from the Chonhado, the Korean atlas of the world. Here, on thin parchment, the earth is a wobbly blue watercolor dot centered around the sacred Mount Meru, close to a large red circle representing Beijing. China and Korea make up the large part of the map, while the foreign lands beyond their borders are like afterthoughts, represented only by a thin peripheral strip of land.\n\nEd’s friend Tom Harper, the soft spoken maps curator at the British Library, explains the strange cartography. “The rest of the world wasn’t necessary to this insular culture at this time, so it just doesn’t appear,” he notes. Because of this obvious disregard for Western imperial standards of empiricism and accuracy, the Chonhado was derided for decades by cartographers and historians. And yet its premise—putting yourself at the center of the world—isn’t far from that of the digital maps being ferociously assembled today by Google and other modern-day mapping giants. In this vision of the world, we are the tiny blue dots at the center of the map, like billions of miniaturized Chonhados. The Chonhado, the Korean atlas of the heavens and earth Photo: Library of Congress Previously, Parsons says, maps were “created by someone else for whatever purpose they created it for, and it was the same map that everyone else saw. But now your map is literally your map.” It is billions of people’s maps, according to Google, but it is also Google’s map, and as the company’s Geospatial Technologist, Parsons’s job is meant to make users and governments feel comfortable with Google’s control of it. As it seeks to maintain growth, Alphabet Inc. has bet big on personalizing Google’s flagship products—search, maps, and mail—which means capitalizing upon ever more sensitive information about where users go, and what they do there. “That is my job, to be that kind of lightning conductor, good and bad,” he says. “My job is about evangelism, trying to get people to see the world the way that we see the world.” A jovial middle-aged Brit schooled in geography and cartography, Parsons has been at the forefront of the digital mapping revolution for two decades, first at Autodesk and then in the public sector, as the first—and only—CTO of Ordnance Survey, Great Britain’s national mapping agency. “I probably represent something that Google’s not very good at, and that’s having a human face.”\n\nIt was in that capacity that Parsons first crossed paths with engineer Brian McClendon and entrepreneur John Hanke. In 2001, the two founded Keyhole, Inc. and launched EarthViewer, a satellite mapping application. Keyhole survived the dot-com crash by providing its technology to real estate and tourism companies, as well as to U.S. military and intelligence agencies; among its investors was the CIA’s venture capital fund, In-Q-Tel. But much of the public hadn’t heard of Keyhole until it began working with CNN to broadcast satellite images of Iraq during the 2003 U.S. invasion.\n\nWhen they demoed their software for Larry Page and Sergey Brin in April 2004, says McClendon, “they came back with an offer to buy the company the next day.” EarthViewer would become the basis for Google Earth, which, along with Maps, launched the following year. (McClendon left Alphabet in 2015 and now runs Uber’s Advanced Technologies Center, where he is helping develop the company’s self-driving car project; like Google’s and Apple’s, such cars are only as reliable as the digital maps underneath them.) What was true of the Chonhado was once true of Google Earth: its focus began around the area most important to its makers, the U.S. “You would see the oceans, but if you panned them out, there was nothing there,” remembers Hanke. “It was like one of these maps made in the dark ages, because Google hadn’t acquired the rights to incorporate that data into the product.” To this day, Windows users launching Google Earth for the first time will see the Earth centered near McClendon’s childhood home in Lawrence, Kansas. When he arrived at Google’s London office in 2007, Parsons was in many ways perfectly poised to help acquire the missing parts of the map, in part by convincing governments to share their data with the company: at the Ordnance Survey, he played a crucial role as the British government’s liaison to Hanke and McClendon as they assembled Google’s map of the United Kingdom. Within the company’s geo group, said Rebecca Moore, director of engineering for Google Earth, Parsons cuts a “CTO-like figure.” But he also plays a role outside the company, gathering ideas, forging partnerships with academics, government, and technologists, and promoting Google’s mission to organize the world’s geographic information. “I probably represent something that Google’s not very good at, and that’s having a human face,” he says. Not surprisingly, helping to steward the world’s largest map involves traveling all over it. Parsons’s personal website details recent stops in Hungary, California, Belgium, and Paris. On these trips, he meets with academics, GIS researchers, public servants, and private vendors in the hopes of getting the cartographic community to “game mindshare” with him, as he puts it, in “reinventing cartography” and thinking about “the where of everything.” At a 2014 conference, Parsons’s presentation included a discussion of the Catalhoyuk map, a faded stone mural dated to 6500 BC, said to be the world’s oldest map. “If we’re really honest, the techniques that we’ve used in cartography haven’t really changed much in those 8500 years, where we’ve gone from writing on cave walls, to etching, to printing on paper, to ultimately producing maps that will appear on screens,” he told the audience. “We haven’t made that leap to say the media is radically different.” But Google has been making that leap, layering in up-to-the-minute travel information and user-generated data to bring Maps closer to what Parsons calls a “selfie for the planet.” On recent trips to Malta and Belfast, he loyally contributed to improving the product using Google’s Street View and Maps apps, snapping photos and panoramas, including one with his “family sniggering in the background.”\n\n“It was in Google Maps within two minutes,” he said. “Because it was me, it went through the process a little bit quicker.” When members of the public upload photos and corrections to Maps, they first go through Google’s moderators, who make up one of its largest teams around the world and maintain its “database of things”—sights, restaurants, hotels, anything that appears with a rating on Google maps. Near Rawalpindi, a Pakistani city less than 10 miles southwest of Islamabad, a moderator-vetted user added a park in the shape of an Android robot peeing on an Apple logo. Moderators removed it after another user posted a screenshot on Facebook. Google Maps The system isn’t perfect. “We’ve had to work hard on moderation,” he says, mentioning a 2015 incident in which someone digitized “a lake in the shape of an Android pissing on an Apple logo,” Google called it “inappropriate user-created content.” “That didn’t go down very well. We had to make our moderation processes a bit more robust.” Parsons is one of few visible players in the company’s Geo unit, which encompasses all of Google’s geospatial technologies— Led by Jen Fitzpatrick, one of the company’s first female engineers, the unit works on apps like Google Maps and Google Earth, but also critical databases used in search, mail, and more. The effort is so large—and dependent upon manpower, from engineers to the drivers of Street View cars—that Google does not specify how many of its employees are devoted to geospatial technology. (In 2012, it said the number was over 7,100.) But other numbers are telling: Google Maps enjoys over 1 billion monthly active users, the company says, making it the world’s most used map. Google Maps ranks no. 6 among U.S. smartphone users, between Search, at 5, and Gmail; Apple Maps is no. 13 according to a January report by ComScore. (Apple, for its part, has claimed that iPhone users now turn to its Maps application 3.5X more than “the next leading mapping app.”) Parsons hopes Google’s maps pass what it calls “the toothbrush test”: “You only use your toothbrush every day because you’re completely confident that it’s not poisoning you.” Of all Google searches, says McClendon, approximately 30% are local in nature, and 10% are maps- related. These days, the company reports, location-related searches are growing 50% faster than all mobile searches. In 2013, a report commissioned by Google estimated that the value of Geo services is between $150 to $270 billion in revenue annually–in addition to 1.1 billion hours saved per year by keeping people from getting lost or “avoiding wasted journey time.” To compete with a range of tech titans—besides Apple, companies like Nokia, TomTom, and Microsoft have invested heavily in mapping technologies—Google is focusing on personalization. Parsons’s hope is that using an increasingly personalized Google Maps—and syncing one’s location with surrounding devices, from your cell phone to your garage, heater, and car—will pass what Google calls “the toothbrush test.”\n\n“Is the technology so valuable, so familiar, that you use it every day, that you don’t really think about it?” Parsons asks. “To get that level of trust, we need people to understand and be completely confident with it. You only use your toothbrush every day because you’re completely confident that it’s not poisoning you, it’s not going to make your teeth fall out.” Photo: Irina Palei via Shutterstock The Future Of Earth And Maps Getting Google’s mapping apps to pass the toothbrush test is crucial to the company’s plans for geospatial expansion. Though the Google Earth API was deprecated in 2014 and will be fully shut down by the end of the year, its imagery is now largely incorporated into the Maps satellite view. The plan, says Parsons, is to bring Maps and Earth even closer together. “What we’re looking to do is to go back to that ethos of Google Earth being the canvas upon which you can put your own content, which we’ve kind of lost in Google Maps at the moment,” says Parsons. The revamped Google Earth, which will run on both mobile phones and browsers–and which Moore and Parsons can only say will arrive “soon”—will aim to meet the goal set forward during its earliest days: “that Google Earth would be the browser for the planet,” says Parsons. “The same way that you use Internet Explorer or Chrome or Safari to go and visit websites, you’d use Google Earth to go and visit places, and you could author information about those places within Google Earth and then share those things,” says Parsons. “For example, ‘this is where I went on holiday,’ or ‘this is my view of the political geography of South Africa,’ and use Google Earth as a tool for making that story available to people.” Immersive maps “enriched with information and enriched with interactivity, or transformed into entertainment,” Hanke says, “will be something people expect.”\n\nThe new Google Earth will “reinvent it for the web and mobile,” making it “much more of a storytelling platform,” Moore says. “It will have feeds of information coming in that make it a dashboard for the planet. If you hear about something going on, you’ll open Google Earth and that’s where you’ll find out what’s happening.” Augmented reality and indoor mapping are also becoming a large part of Google’s Geo operation—an internal division called “Project Tango” is building “a mobile device that can see how we see,” in order to create 3-D maps of indoor spaces, among other capabilities. That will bring Google Maps closer to the interactive geospatial apps like Field Trip, Ingress, and Pokemon GO that Hanke has been creating at Niantic Labs, the startup he launched within Google in 2010.\n\n“I don’t know if Pokemon Go becomes part of Google Maps,” Hanke said when I asked whether he thinks his two creations might blend. “But I think people’s experience of being in places, and being transformed digitally—either enriched with information and enriched with interactivity, or transformed into entertainment—I definitely think that people will become accustomed to that and it will be something people expect.” The newest Maps update includes “promoted pins” among other features Google Maps, meanwhile, has been undergoing more incremental tweaks. Google has incorporated traffic data from Waze, the crowdsourced traffic mapping app that it bought in 2013 for $1 billion, into Maps. As it searches for new revenue, the Alphabet Inc. company has also made various efforts to fuse its ad-based model with geography. Under its latest update to Maps, users will begin to see logos—”promoted pins” in Googlespeak—for nearby coffee shops, gas stations, or restaurants, while revamped local business pages can now contain special offers and in some cases the ability to browse product inventory. “We’ve got a very rich source of data there, but also one that we have to be very careful of. Your location on the planet is one of the most sensitive pieces of information that anyone can hold on you.”\n\nThe best emblem for the company’s literally global ambitions may not be Google Earth but Street View, which amounts to essentially the most immersive and detailed “map” of the world ever made. The future of Google Maps may closely resemble a dynamic version of Street View, with up-to-the-minute information and imagery, but it’s a future that merits caution too: after privacy concerns emerged around its Street View program, Germany investigated and ultimately fined Google for covertly collecting data from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks using Street View cars—surveillance as cartography. This concern isn’t lost on Parsons: if you use Google Maps, the company more or less knows where you are, where you’re going, and what you’re looking for. “We’re kind of looking at what to do with it. We’ve got a very rich source of data there, but also one that we have to be very careful of,” he says. “Your location on the planet is one of the most sensitive pieces of information that anyone can hold on you.” Google says it uses anonymized user locations to map car and consumer traffic, while specific information about individual locations is strictly managed internally. Parsons paints a more nuanced picture. “Actually, it’s very hard to truly anonymize that sort of data. At the moment, we track you as an individual and we strip off the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of tracking, so we don’t know where you start or end, or where your home or where your work is. But, actually, over a period of a few days and weeks we can certainly start to build those tracks and understand where people are moving around—and potentially identify people from that.” “We are very, very cautious about that sort of data,” he hastens to add. “We’d never give it to someone else.” Changes—And Big Fusses The leap from page to screen may have made cartography accessible to more people—and made maps into 3-D, immersive experiences—but it’s also worried some mapping purists, as cartographers have been replaced by their modern-day successors: computer scientists and user-interface designers.\n\n“It’s no longer about paper—it’s about painting pixels,” says Parsons. “Different techniques are needed and required. But you still need that process of abstracting the information that’s most important.” “Cartographers have almost ended up being historians, kind of looking at what cartography was rather than looking forward, saying, well, what’s the potential of augmented reality?” Something has certainly been lost in the translation from local and analog to global and digital: Before the era of Google Maps, each nation had its own cartographic conventions, making for a rich array of designs—often at the expense of foreign travelers. Google prioritizes efficiency, mapping the world according to a single set of conventions aimed at making the world so legible that it often takes an active effort to get lost. But Google’s approach may come at the expense of local cartographic conventions, aesthetics, and geo-political markers, critics worry. “As a citizen, I’m concerned that Google maps looks so banal—it’s like Pleasantville, visually,” says Anne Knowles, a GIS historian at the University of Maine. “It bewitches people that the world is okay, and we’re shocked when it’s not.” To Parsons, trading traditional maps for more practical models is worth the utility gained in getting Google users from point A to point B more efficiently. “Probably, computer scientists aren’t the best ones to figure out how to do that–we really need cartographers,” he admits. Still, “cartography has largely ignored on-screen mapping. Cartographers have almost ended up being historians, kind of looking at what cartography was rather than looking forward, saying, well, what’s the potential of augmented reality? What does that mean for cartography?” “Cartographers have spent centuries thinking about and optimizing information on a piece of paper that can be interpreted both by experts and, later, by novices,” says McClendon. “But the challenge with Google Maps is it’s a dynamic map—it changes based on the zoom level. At each zoom level you go down in the map, there’s more and more information shown.” Breaking with the cartographic past isn’t easy. Consider the minor uproar Google caused when it readjusted its zoom settings to remove extraneous labels: “What happened to Google Maps?” the popular maps developer and writer Justin O’Beirne wondered aloud, as he concluded that the company had “dropped” 38 cities from the map. “No, it’s not you: Google maps really did get crappy,” Quartz editors quipped when they re-published his article.\n\n“There’s been this big fuss–well, you know, it’s us making changes. That’s what happens,” says Parsons. Nothing had been “dropped” from the map: Google merely adjusted which labels appear for certain zoom levels and functions. “I think part of the problem is, many people look at Google Maps as being this static thing. They think in terms of the paper map, and the paper map doesn’t change,” he says. “We do A/B testing for almost everything—we’ll have different populations of maps users being shown different things, and we’ll see what works best. Do they follow the directions we give them? Do they get lost?” “That’s one of the ‘creepy big brother’ elements—we know when you get lost, because you’re not following the directions we’ve told you to follow.” Cartographers have always come under fire for mapping the lives of others—Google just does so more accurately and quickly than ever before. “In the 1840s, the Ordnance Survey had the same battle,” Harper interjects. “At what scale will we map the country? Richer landowners didn’t want their property to be mapped at a large scale. Quite naturally, there was a reluctance to have their lives, spaces, published… if you go back even further to the 16th and 17th centuries when England was colonizing Ireland, surveyors were murdered for trespassing. Nothing’s changed, really.” Those battles set precedents for some of the ones that Google is currently waging. In countries like India and South Korea, national security concerns have led governments to clamp down on mapping services, in some cases deliberately obscuring directions and satellite imagery. Google Maps appears differently depending on the country of your IP address, allowing the company to stay on the right side of the law in the many jurisdictions where it operates. Log in from China, for instance, and Google Maps is strictly controlled by the government, which deliberately inserts errors into GPS systems close to sensitive locations. Those who visit Google.com/maps are presented with the company’s “most universal” rendering of the world. Of course, Google Maps also appears differently depending on who you are—it is designed to highlight businesses on your journey that your friends may have frequented, or that might be of particular interest to you. “Whatever we do, we do universally, we do it for everybody,” says Parsons, but in Google’s increasingly user-centric world, that means helping each of its users see the world in a way that is most relevant to their life and work—perhaps not that of others.\n\n“Our view is different from Apple’s, from Microsoft’s, from OpenStreetMap, from any other map provider… Our maps represent what you or I need to do on a day-to-day basis in the developed part of the world.” This dynamism is its singular strength and its most cited weakness. As the product becomes increasingly ubiquitous, users are apt to take the information it provides as gospel—“Don’t try to outsmart Google, you’ll always lose,” a good friend solemnly advised after an ill-advised road trip detour. But blindly trusting Google can also lead one astray: in March, a demolition company in Rowlett, Texas, tore down the wrong home after Google Maps directed its employees to the wrong address. “There are sources of canonical data–they are ‘the facts,’” says Parsons, who is adamant that Google is not a canonical source in the same way the Ordnance Survey, U.S. Geographic Survey, or the Metropolitan Transportation Authority might be. “We are perhaps the great editors. We do our job to bring you a view of the world that is as consistent and as canonical as it possibly could be, but we’re not the source.” “All maps are imperfect,” says McClendon. But Google’s rendering of the world is “as close to reality as we’ll be able to get for a long time.” Ed Parsons That hasn’t stopped Google’s open-source rival, OpenStreetMap, from taking a more democratic approach to mapping the planet. Whereas Google Maps is a proprietary stream of data resting on a range of private and public and crowdsourced inputs, OpenStreetMap is maintained by a community of volunteers using open data. Parsons is involved “on and off” with the platform, which he calls “a fabulous project,” but one that reflects the enthusiasm of its makers so much that “it’s become almost a parody.” “Cartography is about what you take off, not about what you add,” he says. “I think the community is still learning what cartography actually means. There are companies making a profit—Mapbox, CartoDB—starting to do some interesting things on top of that. It’s like we’re learning again. It’s like the early days of desktop publishing, where everyone would put 50 fonts on their document, because they could. You just want one font, really, that’s what you need.” None of these maps is more perfect than the others, Parsons says; each map is influenced by its creators, with their own worldview. “We as an organization do our best to explain how we come up [with our] worldview–how we come up to that worldview, where it’s coming from, what we’re interested in—but it is our view, and our view is different from Apple’s, from Microsoft’s, from OpenStreetMap, from any other map provider,” says Parsons. “We are representing the world as is valuable and useful to our users. Our maps represent what you or I need to do on a day-to-day basis in the developed part of the world.”\n\nAs part of its efforts to map everywhere—and bring everyone to the map—Google has also empowered groups traditionally written out of Western maps to craft their own portrait of the world. Rebecca Moore, who in addition to running Google Earth’s engineering team, leads Google Earth Outreach, has worked with indigenous peoples in the Amazon, like the Surui tribe, to help them map their territory using their own symbols. This can, for example, make it easier for them to map the locations of the three specific types of trees they use to make arrows. In “the new Google Earth, we make the ability to make a custom map even easier to do, to discover, to share,” says Moore. Within five years, Google Earth will have mapped 100% of the Amazon rainforest, she adds. A self-described “lapsed aviator,” Parsons is one of the few team members from the early days of Google Maps who remains at the company, and he takes a bird’s-eye view of its potential. “I love seeing the world from above. Part of the thing that appealed to me about geography is that it explains the world. It explains why mountains are where they are, why river valleys are where they are, why cities are where they are, and why they’re the shape they are. And you get a wonderful view of that when you’re flying over it, and you get the ultimate view when you can control where you’re flying over.” The more interactive and personally tailored Google Maps gets—the more accurately it simulates actually flying over the world—the better. “I try, in my presentations, to show the Apollo 8 “Earthrise” picture. Less than 10 people have seen that with their own eyes, but yet we get to see that every day. I often wonder, will that change how society views the world—being able to go from the very local, very detailed view, to the world view. It’s something that’s never been possible before.” “I hope that it allows us to recognize the fact that we all do live on the same planet,” he says. “Our own little part of the world is only a few swipes of a mouse away from someone else, and their own little piece of the world. You know, it’s no accident that often you see Google Earth and there are no boundaries, because that’s the way the world is. “At the same time,” he adds, with politic caution, “I think it is important that you can switch on the borders, and you can draw the lines, because they are important.”", "Forget the CPU, GPU, and FPGA, Google says its Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU, advances machine learning capability by a factor of three generations.\n\n“TPUs deliver an order of magnitude higher performance per watt than all commercially available GPUs and FPGA,” said Google CEO Sundar Pichai during the company’s I/O developer conference on Wednesday.\n\nTPUs have been a closely guarded secret of Google, but Pichai said the chips powered the AlphaGo computer that beat Lee Sedol, the world champion in the incredibly complicated game called Go.\n\nPichai didn’t go into details of the Tensor Processing Unit but the company did disclose a little more information in a blog posted on the same day as Pichai’s revelation.\n\n“We’ve been running TPUs inside our data centers for more than a year, and have found them to deliver an order of magnitude better-optimized performance per watt for machine learning. This is roughly equivalent to fast-forwarding technology about seven years into the future (three generations of Moore’s Law),” the blog said. “TPU is tailored to machine learning applications, allowing the chip to be more tolerant of reduced computational precision, which means it requires fewer transistors per operation. Because of this, we can squeeze more operations per second into the silicon, use more sophisticated and powerful machine learning models, and apply these models more quickly, so users get more intelligent results more rapidly.”\n\nThe tiny TPU can fit into a hard drive slot within the data center rack and has already been powering RankBrain and Street View, the blog said.\n\nDon’t give up on the CPU or GPU just yet\n\nWhat isn’t known is what exactly the TPU is. SGI had a commercial product called a Tensor Processing Unit in its workstations in the early 2000s that appears to have been a Digital Signal Processor, or DSP. A DSP is a dedicated chip that does a repetitive, simple task extremely quickly and efficiently. But according to Google there's no connection.\n\nAnalyst Patrick Moorhead of Moore Insights & Strategy, who attended the I/O developer conference, said, from what little Google has revealed about the TPU, he doesn’t think the company is about to abandon traditional CPUs and GPUs just yet.\n\n“It’s not doing the teaching or learning,” he said of the TPU. “It’s doing the production or playback.”\n\nMoorhead said he believes the TPU could be a form of chip that implements the machine learning algorithms that are crafted using more power hungry GPUs and CPUs.\n\nAs to Google’s claim that the TPU’s performance is akin to accelerating Moore’s Law by seven years, he doesn’t doubt it. He sees it as similar to the relationship between a traditional ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) and a CPU.\n\nASICs are hard-coded, highly optimized chips that do one thing really well. They can’t be changed like an FPGA but offer huge performance benefits. He likened the comparison to decoding an H.265 video stream with a CPU versus an ASIC built for that task. A CPU without dedicated circuits would consume far more power than the ASIC at that job.\n\nOne issue with ASICs, though, is their cost and their permanent nature, he said. The only way to change the algorithm, if required by a bug or improvement, is to make a new chip. There's no reprogramming. That’s why ASICs have been traditionally been relegated to entities with unlimited budgets, like governments.\n\nGoogle said it has been secretly using its TPU to make applications like Street View smarter.", "Google has made a significant change to its search results pages by extending the length of titles and descriptions. This was first spotted by Ross Hudgens on Twitter, and later reported on by Jennifer Slegg at The SEM Post.\n\nLong title tags being tested again in the SERPs. Seeing 69 and 70 character results today. pic.twitter.com/esiKTctV96 ADVERTISEMENT — Ross Hudgens (@RossHudgens) May 6, 2016\n\nHere’s What Has Changed\n\nTitle tags have been increased to 70–71 characters, which is up from its previous 50–60 characters. That’s at least enough to fit in another word or two.\n\nMeta descriptions have been increased by 100 characters per line, and extended from two to three lines. That’s a significant increase, and presents far more of an opportunity to tell searchers what the page is about.\n\nSlegg reports that Google is still truncating the descriptions to two lines for many search results still, so you may still see them coming in at around 160 characters at times. When a three line snipped is displayed they come in at 278 characters per line.\n\nIt’s important to note that this may be a test which Google could reverse at any time. By the company’s own admission, it is always A/B testing. So it’s a good idea not to base your SEO efforts on these numbers until it’s known for sure if the test will become a permanent change.\n\nWhat Do SEOs Think?\n\nFor the post part, the change has gone unnoticed. According to this Reddit thread the change in organic search happened on May 4th, and it’s only now that anyone is really talking about it.\n\n“The analysis that I’ve done has shown that Google updated the search results layout to give organic listings an increased title tag size – as well as increased width of the Featured Snippets/Answer Boxes, but have decreased the height of the Featured Snippets/Answer Boxes.”\n\nCommenters in the Reddit thread for the most part agree the change hasn’t been noticed. Redditor Jonathan Jones also wrote in his own blog that the change has impacted CTR in a positive way, which could be a sign it will be here to stay if it continues to product positive change.\n\nJones recommends measuring your CTR from prior to May 4th to now to see if you’ve noticed any positive or negative change as a result of the longer search snippets.", "There are so many AI-powered digital assistants out there these days, we’ll forgive you if you’ve lost track. Hound is an offering from Shazam rival SoundHound, and it’s packed with an impressive number of features considering it doesn’t have the weight of Apple or Google’s engineering teams behind it. Here are five reasons we like it.\n\n\n\n1) It’s platform-agnostic\n\nYou can’t use Siri on Android, of course, and Google Now’s usefulness is somewhat stunted on iOS, where it can’t get its hooks into the deeper parts of the operating system. Hound, in contrast, is available on both Android and iOS for free with matching feature sets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s also fast despite being a third-party app. You can’t do some of the phone tricks that the native apps can (like sift through your email or turn Bluetooth on and off), but whenever you ask Hound something you’ll get a response very quickly from the web.\n\n2) It understands complex questions\n\nIf your query is a long one, just keep talking. Hound will keep track of what you’re saying. For example, try telling Hound, “show me four or five star hotels in Seattle for three nights starting on Friday between one hundred fifty dollars and two hundred fifty dollars a night.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeather is another area where Hound excels. If you ask it, “What’s the weather going to be like in Rome two weeks from now?” then Hound will tell you. And if it doesn’t have the forecast information available, it presents the historical averages for the area instead.\n\n3) It understands follow-up questions\n\nAny of your searches can be easily refined with follow-up questions, so you don’t have to speak out the whole query instead. To take the hotel example from earlier, you can say “just with wi-fi” or “just with a gym” to have Hound filter the list based on your requests.\n\nYou can also add “sorted by lowest price” or “sorted by highest price” on top of your original query, or add location information like “within walking distance of the Golden Gate Bridge.” Other Hound voice commands support follow-up questions in the same way.\n\n4) It can combine answers\n\nAsk Hound how many calories there are in 16 apples and 4 bananas, and it will tell you the total. Ask it what is the current stock price of both Google and Apple, and it shows both answers together. Hound isn’t easily flummoxed if you ask several questions at once.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSponsored\n\nHound can’t deal with every multiple query—not yet, anyway—but plenty do work. Try “five dollars in pounds and yen” if you don’t want to run each comparison separately, for example. You can edit queries manually if your commands aren’t picked up first time.\n\n5) It plays games and music\n\nHound can perform all kinds of tricks, including estimating Uber fares, calculating mortgage payments and instant translations. There are a handful of interactive games built into the app as well. Try “play Blackjack” or “play Hangman” to get started.\n\nHound can play music snippets, too, even without access to your music library. You can say “play” followed by a song or artist to start listening.

A two-legged humanoid robot trudges through the snow, somehow maintaining its balance. Another robot with two arms and pads for hands crouches down and lifts a brown box and delicately places it on a shelf -- then somehow stays upright while a human tries to push it over with a hockey stick. A third robot topples over and clambers back to its feet with ease.\n\nTens of millions of people viewed the video over the next few weeks. Google and the division responsible for the video, Boston Dynamics, were seemingly pushing the frontier in robot technology.\n\nBut behind the scenes a more pedestrian drama was playing out. Executives at Google parent Alphabet Inc., absorbed with making sure all the various companies under its corporate umbrella have plans to generate real revenue, concluded that Boston Dynamics isn’t likely to produce a marketable product in the next few years and have put the unit up for sale, according to two people familiar with the company’s plans.\n\nPossible acquirers include the Toyota Research Institute, a division of Toyota Motor Corp., and Amazon.com Inc., which makes robots for its fulfillment centers, according to one person. Google and Toyota declined to comment, and Amazon didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nRobotics Push\n\nGoogle acquired Boston Dynamics in late 2013 as part of a spree of acquisitions in the field of robotics. The deals were spearheaded by Andy Rubin, former chief of the Android division, and brought about 300 robotics engineers into Google. Rubin left the company in October 2014. Over the following year, the robot initiative, dubbed Replicant, was plagued by leadership changes, failures to collaborate between companies and an unsuccessful effort to recruit a new leader.\n\nAt the heart of Replicant’s trouble, said a person familiar with the group, was a reluctance by Boston Dynamics executives to work with Google’s other robot engineers in California and Tokyo and the unit’s failure to come up with products that could be released in the near term.\n\nTensions between Boston Dynamics and the rest of the Replicant group spilled into open view within Google, when written minutes of a Nov. 11 meeting and several subsequent e-mails were inadvertently published to an online forum that was accessible to other Google workers. These documents were made available to Bloomberg News by a Google employee who spotted them.\n\nThe November meeting was run by Jonathan Rosenberg, an adviser to Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Larry Page and former Google senior vice president, who was temporarily in charge of the Replicant group. In the meeting, Rosenberg said, “we as a startup of our size cannot spend 30-plus percent of our resources on things that take ten years,\" and that \"there’s some time frame that we need to be generating an amount of revenue that covers expenses and (that) needs to be a few years.\"\n\n‘Brick Wall’\n\nAaron Edsinger, director of robotics at Google in San Francisco, said that he had been trying to work with Boston Dynamics to create a low-cost electric quadruped robot and felt “a bit of a brick wall” around the division, according to the minutes of the meeting.\n\nMarc Raibert, a former Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and the founder of Boston Dynamics, said that \"I firmly believe the only way to get to a product is through the work we are doing in Boston. (I) don’t think we are the pie in the sky guys as much as everyone thinks we are,\" the minutes show.\n\nRaibert didn’t respond to multiple messages seeking comment for this story.\n\nPart of the challenge was that Alphabet, created in 2015, was geared toward making Google inviting to startup founders and entrepreneurial executives who wanted to join companies driving toward products and revenue, which could increase shareholder value for those subsidiaries. Page wanted to invite top-tier engineers to join the companies within Alphabet and entice them with equity.\n\nIn December, Google announced that Replicant had been folded into Google’s advanced research group, Google X. In a private all-hands meeting around that time, Astro Teller, the head of Google X, told Replicant employees that if robotics aren’t the practical solution to problems that Google was trying to solve, they would be reassigned to work on other things, according to a person who was at that meeting.\n\nDistancing Google\n\nExclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.\n\nBoston Dynamics, though, was never folded into Google X and was instead put up for sale. After the division’s latest robot video was posted to YouTube, in February, Google’s public-relations team expressed discomfort that Alphabet would be associated with a push into humanoid robotics. Their subsequent e-mails were also published to the internal online forum and became visible to all Google employees.\n\n“There’s excitement from the tech press, but we’re also starting to see some negative threads about it being terrifying, ready to take humans’ jobs,” wrote Courtney Hohne, a director of communications at Google and the spokeswoman for Google X.\n\nHohne went on to ask her colleagues to “distance X from this video,” and wrote, “we don’t want to trigger a whole separate media cycle about where BD really is at Google.”\n\n“We’re not going to comment on this video because there’s really not a lot we can add, and we don’t want to answer most of the Qs it triggers,” she wrote.", "Enlarge Image James Martin/CNET\n\nWith Google Now, you can use voice commands to create reminders, get help with trivia questions, and, yes, even find out \"what does the fox say?\"\n\nAnd, with the recent update from Google, the voice assistant's reponse will sound more natural than ever.

My boss took offense to the Mic Drop animation and assumed that I didn't reply to her because I thought her input was petty (hence the Mic Drop). I just woke up to a very angry voicemail from her which is how I found out about this 'hilarious' prank.\"\n\n\"Some of my very intelligent friends are senior engineers in GOOGLE,\" another person wrote. \"I almost picked up the phone and shout at them because of this stupid creation made me sound so rude to one important customer when I made a mistake to click this stupid button.\"\n\nAnother user, complaining of the \"stress causing agent\" that appeared on his email account, was freaked out that his business correspondence was being compromised by a feature that's \"supposed to be some kind of joke.\"\n\nDavid Kitner wrote: \"This is horrible - Just sent an email to a client with this stupid icon on it.

The reason Google’s cloud-based photo management software has gained so many users so quickly? It makes organizing photos dead easy. It automatically backs up all your images from all of your devices into one central location, plus it collects pictures of the same people or objects into groups, and helps you find images in your archive with text searches. No wonder it’s already become an integral part of photo organization for so many people.\n\nOne of its best features is the Assistant, which is sort of a little robotic helper that keeps your photos in check when you just don’t have the time. It combs through your photos, stitches together GIFs and collages, and suggests enhancements and edits to improve your shots.\n\nToday, Assistant will start doing something else: Auto-creating albums and selecting your best shots without any user input whatsoever. It should be especially handy for vacation photos, as it’ll also chart your trips on a map, and automatically recognize and tag famous places in each frame. These new Assistant-created albums are actually a souped-up version of the existing “Stories” feature, which created little pan-and-scan montages out of related photos. Google says Albums—both manual and Assistant-created—will replace Stories.\n\nAuto Focus\n\nIn the case of an out-of-town trip, Google Photos will recognize the start and end dates of the journey, identify the “best” images, create an album from them, and add a basic Google Map of your journey as a title card. From there, you can edit which photos appear in the album, fine-tune the locations in the map, and add captions to the album. Once you’re done, you can share the album with your contacts and even make it a collaborative effort.\n\nBut how, exactly, does an algorithm pick your “best” photos? And will turning off location services and geotagging affect the accuracy of Google Photos’ vacation-tracking ways? Not so, say two Googlers involved in the project.\n\n“There’s a bunch of ways we can select the ‘best’ photos,” says Google Photos product manager Francois de Halleux. “We use a lot of machine learning to detect the elements in a photo that make it of better quality than another. We also eliminate duplicates.”\n\nIn many cases, the system pegs photos with landmarks in them as the “best” shots. And it can identify those famous places without using your location data at all, although geotagging does help with some fact-checking. In the most-useful cases, it will identify and provide names of landmarks—helping you remember where you went or simply spell things correctly.\n\n“We can detect landmarks, we have 255,000 landmarks that we automatically recognize,” says de Halleux. “It’s a combination of both computer vision and geotags. Even without the geotags, we’d be able to recognize a landmark.”\n\nIn those cases, Google’s system would recognize a landmark, then double-check that recognition against a location or the photo’s geotagging. In some cases, it helps the system identify the real deal versus a replica.\n\n“If we see a photo of the Eiffel Tower, we know the person is in Paris… or in Las Vegas,” explains Google Photos product lead David Lieb.\n\nVacations aren’t the only use case for the new Assistant-created albums, but they’re likely to be the most common scenario for the auto-generated albums. Lieb and de Halleux say that the Assistant looks at the distance you are away from your home as a trigger for album auto-creation, but it also pays attention to how many pictures you’ve taken in a short period of time and whether it’s a national holiday or other significant day.\n\nFacing Forward\n\nOutside of those situations, you may still have some albums created and suggested by the Assistant. In those cases, it looks for group shots with the faces of people it deems “important” to you—faces that show up regularly in your other pictures. It also picks the ones where everyone has their eyes open or is smiling. Ideally, both.\n\nWhile recognizing faces in photos and grouping them together in the “People” section of the app is as impressive as it is creepy, Google says its machine learning stops short of assigning real-world identities to those faces. Users can tag a person as “Mom” or “Grandpa,” for example, but they’re private tags for sorting and organizational purposes within your own photo roll. The Assistant recognizes if a person is important to you based on the frequency of their appearance in your pictures.\n\n“We think it’s a way to get all the benefit of this face-grouping stuff without any of the creepiness or problems that might ensue from it,” says Lieb. “We think it’s the right place to be on that privacy spectrum.”\n\nThe new Assistant-created albums will roll out today on the Google Photos app for Android and iOS, as well as the web version of Photos. You’ll likely need to wait for the Assistant to work its magic, but to see if it has created any album suggestions for you, tap the “Assistant” tab at the bottom of the main screen. You can also create your own albums by tapping the “+” button at the top of the app and selecting “Create new Album.”", "So Rozovsky started looking for other groups she could join. A classmate mentioned that some students were putting together teams for ‘‘case competitions,’’ contests in which participants proposed solutions to real-world business problems that were evaluated by judges, who awarded trophies and cash. The competitions were voluntary, but the work wasn’t all that different from what Rozovsky did with her study group: conducting lots of research and financial analyses, writing reports and giving presentations. The members of her case-competition team had a variety of professional experiences: Army officer, researcher at a think tank, director of a health-education nonprofit organization and consultant to a refugee program. Despite their disparate backgrounds, however, everyone clicked. They emailed one another dumb jokes and usually spent the first 10 minutes of each meeting chatting. When it came time to brainstorm, ‘‘we had lots of crazy ideas,’’ Rozovsky said.\n\nOne of her favorite competitions asked teams to come up with a new business to replace a student-run snack store on Yale’s campus. Rozovsky proposed a nap room and selling earplugs and eyeshades to make money. Someone else suggested filling the space with old video games. There were ideas about clothing swaps. Most of the proposals were impractical, but ‘‘we all felt like we could say anything to each other,’’ Rozovsky told me. ‘‘No one worried that the rest of the team was judging them.’’ Eventually, the team settled on a plan for a micro­gym with a handful of exercise classes and a few weight machines. They won the competition. (The micro­gym — with two stationary bicycles and three treadmills — still exists.)\n\nRozovsky’s study group dissolved in her second semester (it was up to the students whether they wanted to continue). Her case team, however, stuck together for the two years she was at Yale.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt always struck Rozovsky as odd that her experiences with the two groups were dissimilar. Each was composed of people who were bright and outgoing. When she talked one on one with members of her study group, the exchanges were friendly and warm. It was only when they gathered as a team that things became fraught. By contrast, her case-competition team was always fun and easygoing. In some ways, the team’s members got along better as a group than as individual friends.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n‘‘I couldn’t figure out why things had turned out so different,’’ Rozovsky told me. ‘‘It didn’t seem like it had to happen that way.’’\n\nOur data-saturated age enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of. Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves. ‘‘We’re living through a golden age of understanding personal productivity,’’ says Marshall Van Alstyne, a professor at Boston University who studies how people share information. ‘‘All of a sudden, we can pick apart the small choices that all of us make, decisions most of us don’t even notice, and figure out why some people are so much more effective than everyone else.’’\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet many of today’s most valuable firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers ­— a practice known as ‘‘employee performance optimization’’ — isn’t enough. As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based. One study, published in The Harvard Business Review last month, found that ‘‘the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more’’ over the last two decades and that, at many companies, more than three-quarters of an employee’s day is spent communicating with colleagues.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. In a 2015 study, executives said that profitability increases when workers are persuaded to collaborate more. Within companies and conglomerates, as well as in government agencies and schools, teams are now the fundamental unit of organization. If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFive years ago, Google — one of the most public proselytizers of how studying workers can transform productivity — became focused on building the perfect team. In the last decade, the tech giant has spent untold millions of dollars measuring nearly every aspect of its employees’ lives. Google’s People Operations department has scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together (the most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions) to which traits the best managers share (unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers).\n\nThe company’s top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people. They embraced other bits of conventional wisdom as well, like ‘‘It’s better to put introverts together,’’ said Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google’s People Analytics division, or ‘‘Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work.’’ But, Dubey went on, ‘‘it turned out no one had really studied which of those were true.’’\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2012, the company embarked on an initiative — code-named Project Aristotle — to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared. Dubey, a leader of the project, gathered some of the company’s best statisticians, organizational psychologists, sociologists and engineers. He also needed researchers. Rozovsky, by then, had decided that what she wanted to do with her life was study people’s habits and tendencies. After graduating from Yale, she was hired by Google and was soon assigned to Project Aristotle.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nProject Aristotle’s researchers began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked. Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests? Or did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards? Based on those studies, the researchers scrutinized the composition of groups inside Google: How often did teammates socialize outside the office? Did they have the same hobbies? Were their educational backgrounds similar? Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy? They drew diagrams showing which teams had overlapping memberships and which groups had exceeded their departments’ goals. They studied how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a team’s success.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo matter how researchers arranged the data, though, it was almost impossible to find patterns — or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference. ‘‘We looked at 180 teams from all over the company,’’ Dubey said. ‘‘We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter.’’\n\nSome groups that were ranked among Google’s most effective teams, for instance, were composed of friends who socialized outside work. Others were made up of people who were basically strangers away from the conference room. Some groups sought strong managers. Others preferred a less hierarchical structure. Most confounding of all, two teams might have nearly identical makeups, with overlapping memberships, but radically different levels of effectiveness. ‘‘At Google, we’re good at finding patterns,’’ Dubey said. ‘‘There weren’t strong patterns here.’’\n\nAs they struggled to figure out what made a team successful, Rozovsky and her colleagues kept coming across research by psychologists and sociologists that focused on what are known as ‘‘group norms.’’ Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather: One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate; another team might develop a culture that encourages vigorous arguments and spurns groupthink. Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound. Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals — they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently — but when they gather, the group’s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team.\n\nProject Aristotle’s researchers began searching through the data they had collected, looking for norms. They looked for instances when team members described a particular behavior as an ‘‘unwritten rule’’ or when they explained certain things as part of the ‘‘team’s culture.’’ Some groups said that teammates interrupted one another constantly and that team leaders reinforced that behavior by interrupting others themselves. On other teams, leaders enforced conversational order, and when someone cut off a teammate, group members would politely ask everyone to wait his or her turn. Some teams celebrated birthdays and began each meeting with informal chitchat about weekend plans. Other groups got right to business and discouraged gossip. There were teams that contained outsize personalities who hewed to their group’s sedate norms, and others in which introverts came out of their shells as soon as meetings began.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams. But Rozovsky, now a lead researcher, needed to figure out which norms mattered most. Google’s research had identified dozens of behaviors that seemed important, except that sometimes the norms of one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group. Was it better to let everyone speak as much as they wanted, or should strong leaders end meandering debates? Was it more effective for people to openly disagree with one another, or should conflicts be played down? The data didn’t offer clear verdicts. In fact, the data sometimes pointed in opposite directions. The only thing worse than not finding a pattern is finding too many of them. Which norms, Rozovsky and her colleagues wondered, were the ones that successful teams shared?\n\nImagine you have been invited to join one of two groups.\n\nTeam A is composed of people who are all exceptionally smart and successful. When you watch a video of this group working, you see professionals who wait until a topic arises in which they are expert, and then they speak at length, explaining what the group ought to do. When someone makes a side comment, the speaker stops, reminds everyone of the agenda and pushes the meeting back on track. This team is efficient. There is no idle chitchat or long debates. The meeting ends as scheduled and disbands so everyone can get back to their desks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTeam B is different. It’s evenly divided between successful executives and middle managers with few professional accomplishments. Teammates jump in and out of discussions. People interject and complete one another’s thoughts. When a team member abruptly changes the topic, the rest of the group follows him off the agenda. At the end of the meeting, the meeting doesn’t actually end: Everyone sits around to gossip and talk about their lives.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhich group would you rather join?\n\nIn 2008, a group of psychologists from Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Union College began to try to answer a question very much like this one. ‘‘Over the past century, psychologists made considerable progress in defining and systematically measuring intelligence in individuals,’’ the researchers wrote in the journal Science in 2010. ‘‘We have used the statistical approach they developed for individual intelligence to systematically measure the intelligence of groups.’’ Put differently, the researchers wanted to know if there is a collective I. Q. that emerges within a team that is distinct from the smarts of any single member.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo accomplish this, the researchers recruited 699 people, divided them into small groups and gave each a series of assignments that required different kinds of cooperation. One assignment, for instance, asked participants to brainstorm possible uses for a brick. Some teams came up with dozens of clever uses; others kept describing the same ideas in different words. Another had the groups plan a shopping trip and gave each teammate a different list of groceries. The only way to maximize the group’s score was for each person to sacrifice an item they really wanted for something the team needed. Some groups easily divvied up the buying; others couldn’t fill their shopping carts because no one was willing to compromise.\n\nWhat interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.\n\nBut what was confusing was that not all the good teams appeared to behave in the same ways. ‘‘Some teams had a bunch of smart people who figured out how to break up work evenly,’’ said Anita Woolley, the study’s lead author. ‘‘Other groups had pretty average members, but they came up with ways to take advantage of everyone’s relative strengths. Some groups had one strong leader. Others were more fluid, and everyone took a leadership role.’’\n\nAs the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’ On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. ‘‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’’ Woolley said. ‘‘But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’’\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSecond, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people’s eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling — an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in Woolley’s experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.\n\nIn other words, if you are given a choice between the serious-minded Team A or the free-flowing Team B, you should probably opt for Team B. Team A may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency. But the group’s norms discourage equal speaking; there are few exchanges of the kind of personal information that lets teammates pick up on what people are feeling or leaving unsaid. There’s a good chance the members of Team A will continue to act like individuals once they come together, and there’s little to suggest that, as a group, they will become more collectively intelligent.\n\nIn contrast, on Team B, people may speak over one another, go on tangents and socialize instead of remaining focused on the agenda. The team may seem inefficient to a casual observer. But all the team members speak as much as they need to. They are sensitive to one another’s moods and share personal stories and emotions. While Team B might not contain as many individual stars, the sum will be greater than its parts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWithin psychology, researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like ‘‘conversational turn-taking’’ and ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ as aspects of what’s known as psychological safety — a group culture that the Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson defines as a ‘‘shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.’’ Psychological safety is ‘‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,’’ Edmondson wrote in a study published in 1999. ‘‘It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.’’\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWhen Rozovsky and her Google colleagues encountered the concept of psychological safety in academic papers, it was as if everything suddenly fell into place. One engineer, for instance, had told researchers that his team leader was ‘‘direct and straightforward, which creates a safe space for you to take risks.’’ That team, researchers estimated, was among Google’s accomplished groups. By contrast, another engineer had told the researchers that his ‘‘team leader has poor emotional control.’’ He added: ‘‘He panics over small issues and keeps trying to grab control. I would hate to be driving with him being in the passenger seat, because he would keep trying to grab the steering wheel and crash the car.’’ That team, researchers presumed, did not perform well.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMost of all, employees had talked about how various teams felt. ‘‘And that made a lot of sense to me, maybe because of my experiences at Yale,’’ Rozovsky said. ‘‘I’d been on some teams that left me feeling totally exhausted and others where I got so much energy from the group.’’ Rozovsky’s study group at Yale was draining because the norms — the fights over leadership, the tendency to critique — put her on guard. Whereas the norms of her case-competition team — enthusiasm for one another’s ideas, joking around and having fun — allowed everyone to feel relaxed and energized.\n\nFor Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n‘‘We had to get people to establish psychologically safe environments,’’ Rozovsky told me. But it wasn’t clear how to do that. ‘‘People here are really busy,’’ she said. ‘‘We needed clear guidelines.’’\n\nHowever, establishing psychological safety is, by its very nature, somewhat messy and difficult to implement. You can tell people to take turns during a conversation and to listen to one another more. You can instruct employees to be sensitive to how their colleagues feel and to notice when someone seems upset. But the kinds of people who work at Google are often the ones who became software engineers because they wanted to avoid talking about feelings in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRozovsky and her colleagues had figured out which norms were most critical. Now they had to find a way to make communication and empathy — the building blocks of forging real connections — into an algorithm they could easily scale.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn late 2014, Rozovsky and her fellow Project Aristotle number-crunchers began sharing their findings with select groups of Google’s 51,000 employees. By then, they had been collecting surveys, conducting interviews and analyzing statistics for almost three years. They hadn’t yet figured out how to make psychological safety easy, but they hoped that publicizing their research within Google would prompt employees to come up with some ideas of their own.\n\nAfter Rozovsky gave one presentation, a trim, athletic man named Matt Sakaguchi approached the Project Aristotle researchers. Sakaguchi had an unusual background for a Google employee. Twenty years earlier, he was a member of a SWAT team in Walnut Creek, Calif., but left to become an electronics salesman and eventually landed at Google as a midlevel manager, where he has overseen teams of engineers who respond when the company’s websites or servers go down.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n‘‘I might be the luckiest individual on earth,’’ Sakaguchi told me. ‘‘I’m not really an engineer. I didn’t study computers in college. Everyone who works for me is much smarter than I am.’’ But he is talented at managing technical workers, and as a result, Sakaguchi has thrived at Google. He and his wife, a teacher, have a home in San Francisco and a weekend house in the Sonoma Valley wine country. ‘‘Most days, I feel like I’ve won the lottery,’’ he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSakaguchi was particularly interested in Project Aristotle because the team he previously oversaw at Google hadn’t jelled particularly well. ‘‘There was one senior engineer who would just talk and talk, and everyone was scared to disagree with him,’’ Sakaguchi said. ‘‘The hardest part was that everyone liked this guy outside the group setting, but whenever they got together as a team, something happened that made the culture go wrong.’’\n\nSakaguchi had recently become the manager of a new team, and he wanted to make sure things went better this time. So he asked researchers at Project Aristotle if they could help. They provided him with a survey to gauge the group’s norms.\n\nWhen Sakaguchi asked his new team to participate, he was greeted with skepticism. ‘‘It seemed like a total waste of time,’’ said Sean Laurent, an engineer. ‘‘But Matt was our new boss, and he was really into this questionnaire, and so we said, Sure, we’ll do it, whatever.’’\n\nThe team completed the survey, and a few weeks later, Sakaguchi received the results. He was surprised by what they revealed. He thought of the team as a strong unit. But the results indicated there were weaknesses: When asked to rate whether the role of the team was clearly understood and whether their work had impact, members of the team gave middling to poor scores. These responses troubled Sakaguchi, because he hadn’t picked up on this discontent. He wanted everyone to feel fulfilled by their work. He asked the team to gather, off site, to discuss the survey’s results. He began by asking everyone to share something personal about themselves. He went first.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n‘‘I think one of the things most people don’t know about me,’’ he told the group, ‘‘is that I have Stage 4 cancer.’’ In 2001, he said, a doctor discovered a tumor in his kidney. By the time the cancer was detected, it had spread to his spine. For nearly half a decade, it had grown slowly as he underwent treatment while working at Google. Recently, however, doctors had found a new, worrisome spot on a scan of his liver. That was far more serious, he explained.\n\nNo one knew what to say. The team had been working with Sakaguchi for 10 months. They all liked him, just as they all liked one another. No one suspected that he was dealing with anything like this.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n‘‘To have Matt stand there and tell us that he’s sick and he’s not going to get better and, you know, what that means,’’ Laurent said. ‘‘It was a really hard, really special moment.’’\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter Sakaguchi spoke, another teammate stood and described some health issues of her own. Then another discussed a difficult breakup. Eventually, the team shifted its focus to the survey. They found it easier to speak honestly about the things that had been bothering them, their small frictions and everyday annoyances. They agreed to adopt some new norms: From now on, Sakaguchi would make an extra effort to let the team members know how their work fit into Google’s larger mission; they agreed to try harder to notice when someone on the team was feeling excluded or down.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere was nothing in the survey that instructed Sakaguchi to share his illness with the group. There was nothing in Project Aristotle’s research that said that getting people to open up about their struggles was critical to discussing a group’s norms. But to Sakaguchi, it made sense that psychological safety and emotional conversations were related. The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. In fact, they sometimes matter more.\n\n‘‘I think, until the off-site, I had separated things in my head into work life and life life,’’ Laurent told me. ‘‘But the thing is, my work is my life. I spend the majority of my time working. Most of my friends I know through work. If I can’t be open and honest at work, then I’m not really living, am I?’’\n\nWhat Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a ‘‘work face’’ when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor.\n\nWhich isn’t to say that a team needs an ailing manager to come together. Any group can become Team B. Sakaguchi’s experiences underscore a core lesson of Google’s research into teamwork: By adopting the data-driven approach of Silicon Valley, Project Aristotle has encouraged emotional conversations and discussions of norms among people who might otherwise be uncomfortable talking about how they feel. ‘‘Googlers love data,’’ Sakaguchi told me. But it’s not only Google that loves numbers, or Silicon Valley that shies away from emotional conversations. Most work­places do. ‘‘By putting things like empathy and sensitivity into charts and data reports, it makes them easier to talk about,’’ Sakaguchi told me. ‘‘It’s easier to talk about our feelings when we can point to a number.’’\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSakaguchi knows that the spread of his cancer means he may not have much time left. His wife has asked him why he doesn’t quit Google. At some point, he probably will. But right now, helping his team succeed ‘‘is the most meaningful work I’ve ever done,’’ he told me. He encourages the group to think about the way work and life mesh. Part of that, he says, is recognizing how fulfilling work can be. Project Aristotle ‘‘proves how much a great team matters,’’ he said. ‘‘Why would I walk away from that? Why wouldn’t I spend time with people who care about me?’’\n\nThe technology industry is not just one of the fastest growing parts of our economy; it is also increasingly the world’s dominant commercial culture. And at the core of Silicon Valley are certain self-mythologies and dictums: Everything is different now, data reigns supreme, today’s winners deserve to triumph because they are cleareyed enough to discard yesterday’s conventional wisdoms and search out the disruptive and the new.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe paradox, of course, is that Google’s intense data collection and number crunching have led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known. In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe fact that these insights aren’t wholly original doesn’t mean Google’s contributions aren’t valuable. In fact, in some ways, the ‘‘employee performance optimization’’ movement has given us a method for talking about our insecurities, fears and aspirations in more constructive ways. It also has given us the tools to quickly teach lessons that once took managers decades to absorb. Google, in other words, in its race to build the perfect team, has perhaps unintentionally demonstrated the usefulness of imperfection and done what Silicon Valley does best: figure out how to create psychological safety faster, better and in more productive ways.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n‘‘Just having data that proves to people that these things are worth paying attention to sometimes is the most important step in getting them to actually pay attention,’’ Rozovsky told me. ‘‘Don’t underestimate the power of giving people a common platform and operating language.’’\n\nProject Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel — that can’t really be optimized. Rozovsky herself was reminded of this midway through her work with the Project Aristotle team. ‘‘We were in a meeting where I made a mistake,’’ Rozovsky told me. She sent out a note afterward explaining how she was going to remedy the problem. ‘‘I got an email back from a team member that said, ‘Ouch,’ ’’ she recalled. ‘‘It was like a punch to the gut. I was already upset about making this mistake, and this note totally played on my insecurities.’’\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf this had happened earlier in Rozovsky’s life — if it had occurred while she was at Yale, for instance, in her study group — she probably wouldn’t have known how to deal with those feelings. The email wasn’t a big enough affront to justify a response. But all the same, it really bothered her. It was something she felt she needed to address.\n\nAnd thanks to Project Aristotle, she now had a vocabulary for explaining to herself what she was feeling and why it was important. She had graphs and charts telling her that she shouldn’t just let it go. And so she typed a quick response: ‘‘Nothing like a good ‘Ouch!’ to destroy psych safety in the morning.’’ Her teammate replied: ‘‘Just testing your resilience.’’\n\n‘‘That could have been the wrong thing to say to someone else, but he knew it was exactly what I needed to hear,’’ Rozovsky said. ‘‘With one 30-second interaction, we defused the tension.’’ She wanted to be listened to. She wanted her teammate to be sensitive to what she was feeling. ‘‘And I had research telling me that it was O.K. to follow my gut,’’ she said. ‘‘So that’s what I did. The data helped me feel safe enough to do what I thought was right.’’", "It hasn’t made sense for Google to continue to invest in two separate photo storage and sharing applications, as it has been doing with the newer Google Photos and the dated software Picasa. And now the company is finally going to do something about that: Google announced this morning that it will no longer support the Picasa desktop application as of March 16, 2016. In addition, it will be archiving Picasa Web Albums data at a later date while encouraging those users to convert to Google Photos instead.\n\nIt’s clear that Google is concerned about backlash from its devoted user base who still relies on Picasa, given the tone of today’s announcement. The company emphasized how much time it has invested in making sure it makes the transition as painless as possible for end users.\n\n“We know for many of you, a great deal of care has gone into managing your photos and videos using Picasa—including the hours you’ve invested and the most precious moments you’ve trusted us with,” writes Anil Sabharwal, Head of Google Photos on a blog post. “So we will take some time in order to do this right and provide you with options and easy ways to access your content,” he added.\n\nFor those who are using the Picasa desktop application, it will continue to work as it does today – and if you choose to download it before the shutdown date of March 16, that will also be the case. However, the software will no longer receive future updates.\n\nTo be fair, the software hadn’t been updated much as it was – the desktop app may have received minor tweaks, security patches and bug fixes, but its overall user interface is incredibly dated. It looks much like it did years ago.\n\nFor those who want to make the switch to Google Photos, there’s a desktop uploader app available at photos.google.com/apps that can be used going forward.\n\nMeanwhile, there’s likely more concern from users about the data collected on Picasa Web Albums, which includes very specific metadata about their photos. Specifically, users may have tagged their photos for organizational purposes, as well as added captions. Friends and family may have commented on some photos, as well. It doesn’t sound like that metadata has made the transition to Google Photos, however.\n\nGoogle notes that the easiest way to access, modify and share the content from a Picasa Web Album is to log into Google Photos, as photos and videos will already be there for you, automatically.\n\nBut some Picasa Web Albums users don’t want to join Google Photos for whatever reason. Google is practically going out of its way to address their needs, saying that it will create “a new place for you to access your Picasa Web Albums data.”\n\nThere aren’t a lot of details about this new place yet, except that it will offer users tools to “view, download, or delete” your Picasa Web Albums. However, it won’t allow users to create, organize or edit albums – to do that, they would have to move to Google Photos or some other program.\n\nThis part of the transition is coming after the end date for Picasa on the desktop, as Google says it won’t start rolling out these changes until May 1, 2016.\n\nGoogle notes that it will also retire some functions of the Picasa API, affecting developers.\n\nIt’s somewhat surprising that it has taken Google this long to end support for Picasa, given how much more advanced and functional its newer Google Photos product is today.\n\nIn fact, every time Picasa experienced a glitch and the Web Albums product would go down, I would ask Google if it had killed the service at last. Google spokespersons would always say “no.” Even as late as last summer, the company touted its devotion to the product, telling me that “Picasa continues to be part of our overall Photos offering, and we’ve worked hard to make sure that almost everything you do in Picasa is compatible with Google Photos.”\n\nThat line of thinking, obviously, has now changed.\n\nBut it does speak to what must be a still-sizable user base using Picasa software and its online albums – and when it comes to users who cling to dated products, it’s not likely they’ll be fans of this change.", "Ray Kurzweil, Google's chief futurist, laid out what he thinks the next few decades will look like in an interview with Playboy.\n\nKurzweil is one of the biggest believers in The Singularity, the moment when humans — with the aid of technology —will supposedly live forever.\n\nHe's chosen the year 2045 because, according to his calculations, \"The nonbiological intelligence created in that year will reach a level that’s a billion times more powerful than all human intelligence today.\"\n\nBut even before 2045, Kurzweil thinks we could begin the deathless process.\n\n\"I believe we will reach a point around 2029 when medical technologies will add one additional year every year to your life expectancy,\" he told Playboy. \"By that I don’t mean life expectancy based on your birthdate, but rather your remaining life expectancy.\"\n\nA lot will have to happen in the next 30 years to make that a reality, but Kurzweil isn't fazed: He predicts that nano machines capable of taking over for our immune system (to fix problems like cancerous cells and clogged arteries) and connecting our brains to the cloud will be available by then.\n\nHe likens that change as the next step in our evolution, the same way our ancestors developed to use the frontal cortex 2 million years ago. The benefits, according to Kurzweil, will be significant.\n\n\"We’ll create more profound forms of communication than we’re familiar with today, more profound music and funnier jokes,\" he tells Playboy. \"We’ll be funnier. We’ll be sexier. We’ll be more adept at expressing loving sentiments.\"\n\nKurzweil points to two advancements that've already happened to support his futuristic claims. The first is the rate of technological advancement: His current Android phone is several orders of magnitude smaller, more powerful, and less expensive than the $11 million computer he used at MIT in the mid 1960's. Technology will only continue to get smaller, more powerful, and less expensive over time.\n\nThe second is work being done at Joslin Diabetes Center in Connecticut, which has used biotechnology to turn off the fat insulin receptor gene in animals, allowing them to eat large quantities of food without developing diabetes or gaining weight. By hacking the human body we can ditch millennia-old genes that serve no purpose and increase our lifespan significantly.\n\nIt's yet to be seen if his plans will pan out, but Kurweil considers dying before the singularity to be a failure on his part, so he's adopted a strict diet with the hope of making it to 2045 and living forever.\n\nGet the latest Google stock price here." ] }
